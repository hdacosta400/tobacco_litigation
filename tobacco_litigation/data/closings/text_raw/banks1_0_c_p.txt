5              MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
6        Court, counsel, ladies and gentlemen of the
7        jury.  Thank you.
8              So we're a little bit ahead of schedule.
9        This was a long trial by general standards.
10        Some of us have been in shorter ones and much
11        longer ones.  Some of you --
12              I can't even remember, quite frankly, if
13        any of you have ever been a juror before that
14        deliberated to verdict; but today you will have
15        that opportunity.
16              And as I told you at the beginning of
17        this case, this is an important case.  It
18        involves serious matters.  And I'm kind of --
19        I'm going to try to address them with the
20        respect, dignity and gravity that I think they
21        deserve.
22              I want to cite to you a simple rule that
23        I think is an overarching theme that should
24        carry through, a principle to help us
25        understand some of this. And what I would say is that a
2        manufacturer is never allowed to needlessly
3        endanger the public.  And if they do, and, as a
4        result, somebody is hurt, the manufacturer is
5        responsible for the harm.
6              If the manufacturer does this wrongful
7        conduct on purpose and intentionally, then such
8        conduct warrants sanctions and penalties by a
9        jury of that company's peers.
10              A manufacturer is never allowed to
11        conceal a danger they would -- they know about
12        in their product, because concealing dangers
13        needlessly endanger the public.  A general
14        principle.
15              And let's talk about the story of this
16        case a little bit comprehensively.  One of the
17        jury instructions that you will hear is that a
18        company is entitled to be treated with the
19        rights of a person.
20              And that's fair, because, in this
21        country, we try to treat all -- all people and
22        fictional corporate entities as equal under the
23        law; but when you have the rights of a person,
24        you also have the obligations of a person.
25              And I told you what this case was going to be about, and I'm going to come back to the
2        theme of what this case is about.
3              This case is about an opportunity,
4        through George Banks and his family, a smoker,
5        who was clearly a class member by every
6        definition of the word -- and I will get into
7        that -- to express, as part of our community,
8        moral condemnation --
9              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
10              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- to a company --
11              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
12              THE COURT:  The objection's overruled.
13              Go ahead, Mr. Schlesinger.
14              MR. FURR:  I make a motion, Your Honor.
15              THE COURT:  Your motion's denied, sir.
16        Overruled.
17              MR. SCHLESINGER:  The punishment, the
18        nature of punishment, the nature of a fine,
19        this is the tool that we have at our disposal
20        in what is known as a quasi-criminal context.
21              This case is not the beginning.  It is
22        far along.  This matter has been going on for
23        decades.  We are at a point in time here where
24        we've moved very far through a process, all
25        established by the findings of the prior Engle jury.
2              You are an Engle progeny jury.  You are
3        the children of Engle.  And you have the right,
4        the responsibility, the obligation and the
5        duty, as His Honor will instruct you, to take
6        the findings, the Supreme Court-approved fault
7        findings, against the wrongful conduct of
8        this -- of these companies.
9              And they are represented here by the
10        attorneys.  And they may be nice guys, but they
11        are not R.J. Reynolds and they are not Philip
12        Morris.
13              They can call any witness they want.
14        They did not call a corporate representative
15        from the company.  You did not hear anybody --
16              MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
17              MR. SCHLESINGER:  They --
18              MR. HEISE:  Objection.
19              THE COURT:  Overruled.
20              MR. SCHLESINGER:  They --
21              You are entitled to hear from whoever
22        witnesses you want.
23              You heard from the family that are
24        survivors of George Banks.  You are also
25        entitled to hear from a corporate representative, a corporate executive, to come
2        down --
3              MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.  This
4        is part of a motion in limine pretrial.
5              THE COURT:  The objection's overruled.
6              Go ahead, sir.
7              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And -- and you are
8        entitled to hear from them and look them in the
9        eye and hear what they have to say about this.
10              But here's what we know.  And this is
11        without a doubt.  And I ask you, embrace these
12        findings, because some of the -- some of the
13        ways to look at it is you have found these
14        findings yourself.  You embrace them as if
15        they -- you found them yourselves.
16              And His Honor will say they are the law,
17        you must apply them, you have no choice.  And
18        that's fine, but they're also true.  They're
19        facts, they're law.
20              This is an industry represented here by
21        the two biggest manufacturers, R.J. Reynolds
22        and Philip Morris, who are culpable for, at
23        fault, right now, for fraud, conspiracy,
24        marketing and selling and --
25              MR. HEISE:  Objection.  This is misstating the law.
2              THE COURT:  Okay.  Again, ladies and
3        gentlemen, the instructions are as I read them.
4        If the lawyers say something contrary to the
5        instructions, always follow the instructions.
6              You may proceed, sir.
7              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Fraud, defrauding the
8        American public as to the known dangers --
9              "Fraud" means being dishonest on purpose.
10        "Conspiracy," to gather together with all of
11        the other members of their -- of their
12        industry, including the Center for Tobacco
13        Research and the Tobacco Industry Research
14        Council, that Mr. Heimann changed the name of
15        so it would sound less industry friendly, and
16        the Tobacco Institute.  And the traveling Truth
17        Squad.  And the College of Tobacco Knowledge.
18              Those entities, the CTR, the TI, the
19        TIRC, all of the major manufacturers, including
20        all of those gobbled up by RJR -- Brown &
21        Williamson, American Tobacco Company -- they
22        are all culpable in a conspiracy to deny the
23        truth about the health effects of tobacco, to
24        sustain their business over the rights and the
25        safety of their customers.  That is a starting point.  And that is why I say --
2              And I will show you how to get to where
3        we want to be, because we have come so far.  We
4        have come so far, because we are at a point
5        where fault has been established.  We will show
6        how it applies to one smoker --
7              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
8        a misstatement of the law, Your Honor.
9              THE COURT:  All right.  Again, ladies and
10        gentlemen, the legal instructions as -- as --
11        they are as how I read them, okay?
12              If the lawyers say something that
13        conflicts with the legal instructions, always
14        follow the legal instructions.
15              Go ahead, Mr. Schlesinger.
16              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.
17              Fault findings have been established.  We
18        will show how a single smoker, George Banks, a
19        little man, not a -- not a giant man, somebody
20        that you could squash under the foot of a
21        corporate entity, we're going to talk about
22        him, and I'm going to empower you, because
23        today you have power.
24              The power you have today is more power
25        than you may ever hold again in your life; and especially with George Banks, and especially
2        with some of the things they said about him and
3        the picture they tried to portray of this
4        gentleman.
5              And I will acknowledge the weaknesses,
6        but the picture they portrayed of this
7        gentleman --
8              What a powerful message.  What a powerful
9        voice from a jury it will be if you say to this
10        company, you can't do this, not even to George
11        Banks, not even to the weak and the vulnerable
12        and the post -- the folks that are most easily
13        preyed upon.
14              MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I object to this.
15              THE COURT:  I sustain the objection.
16              Ladies and gentlemen, that's not an issue
17        in this case, and I sustain the objection.
18              MR. FURR:  I move for a motion --
19              I make a motion, Your Honor.
20              THE COURT:  Your motion's denied.
21              It's improper argument --
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  In --
23              THE COURT:  -- so disregard the comments.
24              Keep going, Mr. Schlesinger.
25              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I apologize, Judge. In an era where a gentleman was born in
2        1914, and his life parallelled the existence,
3        the implementation and the initiation of a
4        product that came to define the 20th Century,
5        the cigarette century, that was epidemic
6        proportions of deaths caused by a product that
7        was deadly and dangerous, known to be so,
8        discovered by people like Claude Teague in the
9        '50s; and rather than make the right choice,
10        the moral choice, the decent choice, the human
11        choice, they lost their way.  Their moral
12        compass did not direct them in the right
13        direction.  They went off the rails.
14              They said, our clients are dying.  Too
15        bad.  We're making money.
16              They didn't care.
17              We will lie.  We will lie to the American
18        public, we will deceive, we will give people an
19        illusion of safety with filters, we will
20        provide them with a psychological crutch to
21        keep smoking, we will undermine everything
22        about what it is that we will need to do to
23        keep our business rolling.  That's --
24              That is what the proofs of the Engle
25        findings establish.  That is where we are when we've come this far.  And I say to you that --
2              If you remember the Iwo Jima Memorial,
3        the famous picture taken when the men were
4        raising the flag in Iwo Jima, in World War II,
5        and they were raising the flag, they had fought
6        a battle against overwhelming odds, and a flag
7        was partially raised; and the symbol there is
8        freedom and achieving monumental victory over
9        great odds.
10              And what is the point of this?  The
11        symbolism is we're pushing the flag up, but
12        it's not all the way up.
13              And what I suggest to you is, today, in
14        part, you get to be the people that finalize
15        planting that flag in a vertical position to
16        say, we validate these Engle findings.  We
17        apply them to the Banks family, to the loss of
18        this one man, this generic smoker, he who is
19        typical of so many of the people that happen to
20        be in the State of Florida that are this Engle
21        progeny.
22              1913, the Camel was invented, 1914.
23        1914, 100 years ago.  We're talking about a day
24        of reckoning.  We're talking about an
25        accounting for past misdeeds.  That is why we're here.  That is why this is important.
2              We're going back in time.  We're looking
3        at corporate conduct that set the -- the sad
4        standard for corporate misbehavior in our
5        country for a century; and when you punish
6        them, you are punishing them not only for
7        George Banks, but for the harm they did to
8        others --
9              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
10              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- and you are --
11              MR. FURR:  Your Honor, that is a flat
12        misstatement of the law.
13              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, I
14        explained that in the jury instructions.  If my
15        jury instructions differ from the lawyers'
16        statements, you'll always follow the jury
17        instructions.
18              MR. FURR:  And I move for a motion based
19        on that.  I make a motion.
20              THE COURT:  Denied, sir.
21              Proceed, Mr. Schlesinger.
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  You'll hear the
23        instruction.  You're allowed to learn about
24        reprehensibility.
25              Reprehensibility has to do with harm to -- entitlement -- not --
2              Excuse me.  I lost -- I lose my train of
3        thought.  I'll get back on track.
4              Look, the law is going to show you very
5        simply --
6              Question 8, put Question 8 up, please.
7        This is the question I want you to know.  This
8        is where we're going.  This is the goal that
9        I'm trying to show you how to get there.  I'm
10        going to show you the roadmap of how to get
11        there.
12              And the question is going to be:  Under
13        the circumstances, are punitive damages
14        warranted?
15              And all of the evidence of what we call
16        reprehensibility, wrongfulness, indecent
17        behavior, amoral conduct, these things all are
18        driven by the actions of the tobacco companies
19        over the decades, through the conspiracy,
20        through the fraud, through the selling of an
21        unreasonably dangerous, defective, addictive
22        product, far more dangerous than it needs to
23        be, that captures people, constrains their
24        choice --
25              MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  Your Honor, I object.  Punitive damages are not
2        available for selling a defective product.
3              THE COURT:  Overruled.
4              MR. FURR:  It's a misstatement of law.
5              THE COURT:  The law is set out in the
6        legal instructions.
7              Ladies and gentlemen, you'll follow those
8        legal instructions as I've instructed you.
9              You may proceed, sir.
10              MR. SCHLESINGER:  For the harm to George
11        Banks and others.  Twenty million people have
12        died.  We're going to talk about that.
13              Look here, you will see.  This is the
14        question.  It's Question 18, not 8, because we
15        have a lot of questions.
16              But this is the question:  State whether
17        by -- you find by clear and convincing evidence
18        that punitive damages are warranted against
19        each defendant under the circumstances of this
20        case.  Philip Morris, "yes"; R.J. Reynolds
21        Tobacco Company, "yes."
22              And then we have to come back Monday.
23        And that's all I want.  I want you to --
24              I want to try to stitch together why we
25        have to be here on Monday, because you're going to check those boxes off "yes," and we can
2        resolve the matter of punitive damages in an
3        amount that you think will be appropriate to
4        punish them for the harm they've done to George
5        Banks and others, and to --
6              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
7              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- deter --
8              MR. FURR:  Punitive damages are not
9        available for harm --
10              THE COURT:  Overruled.
11              MR. FURR:  -- to others.
12              THE COURT:  Overruled.
13              You'll follow the legal instructions,
14        ladies and gentlemen.
15              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- and to deter future
16        conduct.
17              J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the
18        Ring, said that even the smallest person can
19        change the course of the future.
20              I notice J.R.R. is just a rearrangement
21        of RJR, like Reynolds.
22              But even the smallest person can change
23        the course of the future.  And that's the kind
24        of thing I want you to be thinking about as we
25        go through this, because I say this is a day of reckoning, a chance to make an accounting for
2        past misdeeds, for a man whose life parallelled
3        the rise of the Camel cigarette.
4              It was inevitable that their lives would
5        be intertwined.  He fell into a use of a
6        product that was dangerous during a period of
7        time where nobody knew, nobody understood it.
8        They --
9              There was no common knowledge amongst the
10        public before the '60s.  It was not appreciated
11        how dangerous it was.  And folks by the
12        millions, the majority of Americans, the
13        majority of American men, smoked.  They
14        believed it was fine.  Doctors were smoking and
15        telling you --
16              They were using doctors in
17        advertisements.  It's a man from a different
18        era.  You must place that into context so you
19        recognize no matter how it came to be that an
20        official public pronouncement finally, in the
21        '60s, let folks know this is causing cancer,
22        however well that was disseminated, and however
23        well it was countered by the tobacco companies
24        to confuse them and the folks going forward as
25        to the dangers, that confusion campaign went on for decades.
2              But prior to the '60s, George Banks
3        smoked in at least the '30s, maybe even the
4        '20s, but at least the '30s, '40s, '50s and
5        '60s, for decades.
6              And you know the adolescent brain -- you
7        heard evidence that most people smoke in
8        adolescence.  You heard evidence that George
9        started in adolescence.  Most people are
10        addicted in adolescence.  It's an addiction of
11        youth.  Children -- not --
12              Young people who -- young --
13              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I -- I misspoke, and I
15        changed it.
16              MR. HEISE:  We filed a motion --
17              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Young people, youth --
18              THE COURT:  Overruled.
19              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- do not know what
20        they are getting themselves into.  Their
21        frontal lobes are not -- are not well
22        established.  They do not know what the future
23        holds.  They cannot make important, long-range
24        planning decisions.
25              All the statistics we heard are, people that are young, that start smoking cigarettes,
2        they don't think they're going to be smoking in
3        five years.
4              And it's the pediatric brain, so -- so
5        exquisitely sensitive to the -- to the
6        application of nicotine that is what starts the
7        process.  And nicotine addiction is not a free
8        choice, and we'll talk about that.  The --
9              This question, you need to figure out how
10        to get there, and we need to show you the
11        evidence that gets you there.  So let's --
12        let's start doing that now.
13              I want to show you some of the -- some of
14        the documents that are pertinent to this,
15        because you hadn't seen some of the original
16        documents.  You haven't seen some of these
17        documents.
18              I want to start with Tamol, and then I
19        want to go to crop, okay?  I'm going to --
20              There's a lot of documents in evidence
21        that are internal documents.  They talk about
22        such things as, we know we are a highly
23        stylized segment of the pharmaceutical
24        industry.
25              Now they're under the FDA.  That's the Food and Drug Administration.
2              We know that they are selling an
3        addictive drug, and nothing else.  They say,
4        don't think of the cigarette as the product;
5        the cigarette is but a package.  The product is
6        the nicotine in the smoke.  That's what they
7        knew since the '60s.
8              They said, moreover, nicotine is
9        addictive.  They knew that.  They said it had
10        unattractive side effects.  They said that we
11        are in the business of selling nicotine; and if
12        we didn't have nicotine, our entire industry
13        would collapse.
14              Now, human beings, decent human beings --
15              Like Robert Fulghum's book, Everything I
16        Needed to Learn, I Learned in Kindergarten, is,
17        you know, tell people you're sorry if you do
18        something wrong; don't -- don't be -- you know,
19        be decent to people.  Don't hurt people.
20              And no matter how you cut it, no matter
21        what you want to say about my client, George
22        Banks, his human imperfections, no matter how
23        you cut it, what they did was on purpose; and
24        at the end of this, I say to you, no matter
25        what they say to run him down or blame that victim, I say that George Banks was better than
2        they were.
3              He was a better man than they were.
4        Everything about him was decent.  There is
5        nothing in this record other than a character
6        attack on alcohol use, which is irrelevant to
7        whether or not he's a member of the class.
8              It says all Floridians and their
9        survivors, and these are the survivors; and she
10        is a survivor hanging on just to see this case
11        through.
12              And I'm so thankful that Judge Tuter gave
13        us the opportunity to bring this case forward
14        and get this case done, because what you heard
15        from her is a dying declaration.  And that's a
16        rare thing to hear in a courtroom.
17              MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And the --
19              THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, stick to the
20        evidence, please.
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And the one thing she
22        held on to and said was her vision of the
23        central truth in this case:  My husband was
24        addicted.
25              The records are irrefutable.  The man smoked for a minimum of 50 years.  You can read
2        the records any way you want, but do not allow
3        folks to apply shifting justification to how it
4        is that you make a determination of what the
5        evidence should be.
6              You want to keep it fair on both sides?
7        What did George Banks see, what didn't he see?
8        Use the same -- use the same rules.
9              You heard cross-examination of
10        Dr. Proctor.  It was in the Reader's Digest.
11              George Banks didn't read the Reader's
12        Digest.
13              George Banks must have known about all of
14        these dangers.
15              They didn't put anything into his hands.
16        They want to suggest things were in his hands.
17              Then they say, George Banks didn't see
18        our advertisements.  We have no proof that
19        anyone saw those advertisements.  This goes
20        back a hundred years.  Even Roosevelt Hall said
21        it was everywhere.
22              The Federal Trade Commission, in 1981,
23        said it is immersive, it is saturation
24        advertising.  Nobody can avoid advertising.
25              So, all of these things, use the same justification.  Use the same basis of
2        consideration.  The record is very clear.  The
3        record is clear, the man was a long-term
4        smoker.  So what --
5              Of what distraction value, of what
6        confusion value, of what doubt-raising value is
7        it that some other folks that barely knew him,
8        that saw him in a -- in a landlady role, or
9        whatever, didn't see him smoke?
10              Nobody's denying that he smoked.  That's
11        not an issue in the case.  He was a smoker.
12              Now, let's look here.  Dr. Tamol --
13              This record is in evidence.  You haven't
14        seen it yet because we showed it -- we showed
15        it --
16              It's in evidence, but we didn't use it
17        with Dr. Proctor.
18              And we're always trying to go really
19        fast, and I'm going to try to shoot this stuff
20        at you, and you'll get what you can out of it,
21        as best I can.
22              But Dr. Tamol is a Philip Morris
23        researcher, and he was looking into the concept
24        of a health cigarette.
25              In the '70s, when they had the filter fraud going, the phony filters that were the
2        illusion of filtration, and the phony
3        color-changing dye to make people think that
4        something was coming out of the filter, as the
5        health reassurance campaign, as part of the
6        fraud and the conspiracy, to falsify the truth
7        to the American public so they would keep
8        smoking, the psychological crutch to give our
9        addicted smokers a rationale to keep smoking,
10        what was Dr. Tamol doing?
11              One thing they were really concerned
12        about were making these light cigarettes.
13        We're beating that machine that tests them
14        because we know that people will smoke to get
15        the nicotine, because that is the determinant
16        of smoking, the sine qua non -- without which
17        there is nothing -- according to Dr. Teague.
18        Without cigarette --
19              Without nicotine, nobody has ever become
20        a smoker.  My client would have never smoked 50
21        years or more, or 60 years.  Even in '96, in
22        February, there's a note saying he was smoking
23        greater than a pack a day.  So that there is
24        evidence from which you can reasonably say that
25        what the family came up with was they thought he kept smoking.
2              Now, he may have relapsed, he started
3        smoking again.  The '96 record corroborates it.
4        But for purposes of as far as we need to get,
5        50 years of smoking a pack a day is enough to
6        give you esophageal cancer.  There's no doubt
7        about it.
8              We brought a world's expert that's
9        written chapters and books and taught on it for
10        a lifetime.  They brought nobody.  They could
11        have brought anyone they wanted.  They didn't
12        rebut it.  It's not an issue in dispute.  It's
13        a definitive fact, unrebutted.
14              They did not get him to retreat in his
15        opinion.  And Dr. Traube was right on the money
16        as a legitimate, qualified expert, bringing
17        true science that you can rely on.
18              What did Dr. Tamol say after he was
19        figuring out how can we put out a health
20        cigarette, make people think they're healthy?
21        What's the crucial thing we have to do?  We
22        have to determine the minimum nicotine required
23        to keep the normal smoker hooked.
24              The next one about the crop.
25              The minimum amount to keep the normal smoker hooked.  Meaning, no matter what we do,
2        the essential ingredient is nicotine; we've got
3        to make sure we don't go below a minimum level
4        where the smoker can't be hooked.
5              Nobody chooses addiction.  My client did
6        not choose to be addicted.  He smoked as a
7        young man, and he became addicted as a young
8        man, in a world where it was perfectly
9        appropriate.  And when it came time for
10        information to get out there, he was already
11        hooked.  He was addicted.
12              Dr. DiFranza said, in no uncertain
13        terms -- Dr. DiFranza, the real expert -- the
14        man was addicted.  His brain was permanently
15        altered, as is all addicts' brains.  That's
16        just the harsh reality and truth of this.
17              So here, this is Philip Morris, Dunn to
18        Wakeham.  This is an article that came -- a
19        paper, internal, secret documents.  We never
20        would have seen them.  We're learning from
21        them; we'll learn from them for decades.
22              They are the internal industry admissions
23        of that which they denied to the public so they
24        could sustain profits and earn money in the
25        billions for decades.  And they've succeeded. And they continue, to this day, selling a
2        product that they say is organic.
3              Now, in our current society, what does
4        "organic" confer?  Health.  That's health
5        reassurance.
6              Even today, right now, on the shelves at
7        the -- at the drugstores, you can buy American
8        Spirit cigarettes:  100 percent additive-free,
9        menthol.
10              Is that deceptive and unfair trade
11        practices?  Is that honest?  Selling a health
12        cigarette with menthol?
13              And we showed you --
14              MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I object.  This is
15        inflammatory.  It has nothing to do with this
16        case.
17              THE COURT:  I sustain the objection.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  We -- we showed you the
19        2013 scientific conclusion by the Food and Drug
20        Administration, that -- that the cigarettes,
21        even today, are more addictive than ever.
22        That's in the Surgeon General's report.  Right
23        in the beginning of the Surgeon General's
24        report, the way they're made and processed and
25        grown, they're more addictive than ever today. They are not a leaf rolled up in a field
2        like some natural crop.  They are highly
3        processed.  They are full of chemicals like
4        ammonia, and they are made and designed to
5        deliver nicotine in the fastest, most addictive
6        form.  Crack nicotine, freebase nicotine.
7              Menthol, according to the Food and Drug
8        Administration, right now, under consideration
9        for removal to help and benefit the public
10        today, despite the fact that more people are
11        dying now than even 50 years ago.
12              MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I object.  This
13        is --
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  There is --
15              MR. FURR:  -- improper inflammatory
16        argument.  It has nothing to do with this case.
17              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, again,
18        you'll confine the arguments to the evidence in
19        the case.
20              You may proceed, sir.
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Please the Court.
22              Menthol --
23              We read it to you, we showed it to you.
24        Menthol is a chemical additive that makes
25        cigarettes more addictive, initiates youth into smoking, and -- and nicotine addiction, and
2        makes it harder to quit, representing one-third
3        of the market right now.  And it cools the
4        throat as an anesthetic to get that first puff
5        down, because the basis of the business is the
6        adolescent smoker.  They are the replacement
7        smokers.
8              Now, these are cynical and these are
9        comments that disregard humanity and the
10        reasonableness we expect from people.  They
11        lost their moral compass.  Profit motive made
12        folks go off their moral compass.
13              It's a terrible tragedy in this country
14        that's been going on for decades.  We've got
15        the goods on them now because of these internal
16        documents.  And six people at a time, drafted
17        to learn about it, get to know something that
18        they didn't know.
19              And when you were a member of 60 people
20        back there, in a big group, and we asked
21        everybody to raise their hand about who thinks
22        they know something about smoking, many of you
23        said, I thought I knew, I think I know.
24              Well, we live in a culture they created.
25        We've been immersed in cigarette advertising and all the things they've said, the denials
2        they've said all these years.
3              But here's something:  The Elton John
4        song, Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.  It starts
5        out "I thought I knew, but now I know."
6              The rest of the line is "rose trees never
7        grow in New York City.  It's a great song.  But
8        it starts out, "I thought I knew, but now I
9        know."
10              I hope that as you go through these
11        documents with me, that now you know.  Now you
12        know really how we got to where we got in this
13        tobacco epidemic, in this country, in a most
14        inappropriate way.  This is --
15              When you lose 20 million Americans, it's
16        an atrocity.  It is not acceptable under any
17        set of circumstances.  There is no consumer
18        product in the United States, there's no
19        consumer product in the history of the world,
20        that kills over half of its users.
21              And what does it look like?  It looks
22        like a normal -- a normal product.  How can you
23        tell?  Here's a pack of cigarettes.  Here's a
24        pack of cigarettes.  Here's a pack of gum.  It
25        looks normal.  It hides in plain sight.  It doesn't look like there's anything terrible.
2              Here's a pack of playing cards.
3        Everything --
4              It looks the same.  The color schemes are
5        the same.  It doesn't look deadly, dangerous.
6        It doesn't have a skull and crossbones.
7              Liggett finally put "smoking is
8        addictive" on the label, but you don't see that
9        on any of these products now.  They could have
10        voluntarily did it.  They took it off.
11              MR. HEISE:  Objection, preemption.
12              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, I gave
13        you an instruction about the warning labels.
14        You'll follow the instructions I gave you.
15              You may continue, sir.
16              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Right here.  In 1964,
17        they were concerned about the Surgeon General's
18        report coming out and what would the impact be.
19        They were worried about their business.
20              They would always describe themselves in
21        human terms:  The health of their business, the
22        prosperity of their business.  Will they have
23        replacement smokers, because the population
24        must continue to give birth.  This is how they
25        refer to themselves, in human terms. Now, I say they have no soul, but they
2        have a survival instinct.
3              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor, that's
4        just an --
5              THE COURT:  Sir, sir.
6              MR. FURR:  -- inflammatory --
7              THE COURT:  You can not make personal
8        comments.  You can comment on the evidence.
9        That is a personal comment.
10              Ladies and gentlemen, you'll disregard
11        the comment from the attorney.
12              MR. FURR:  I make a motion on the
13        cumulative effect of all these improper
14        arguments.
15              THE COURT:  All right.  Your motion's
16        denied, sir.
17              MR. SCHLESINGER:  The tobacco company has
18        a survival instinct.  I'll prove that to you.
19              Now, right here, this document came
20        out --
21              I'm trying to go through it real quick
22        with you.  This was in 19 -- in 1965, after the
23        1964 Surgeon General's report came out.  And
24        they were trying to figure out what's going to
25        happen to our business. They were worried they were really going
2        to have a deceleration of business.  And it did
3        knock the business down for a little while.  It
4        did go down for a little while, but then they
5        also compared it to an English experience, and
6        they said, you know what?  It wasn't that bad.
7        As a matter of fact, the first punch --
8        meaning, the '64 Surgeon General's report --
9        was by no means as lethal as it first appeared.
10              They're talking about lethality to them.
11        They're referring to themselves
12        anthropomorphically, in human terms, but here's
13        how they refer to their customers.  And you
14        already heard how they described them like rats
15        in a cage.
16              And when you stop being able to see your
17        customers as people, and merely as something
18        that you can consume, just like your customers
19        consume cigarettes, you lose your moral
20        compass, you lose your way.  You do something
21        that is indecent and inexcusable, wrongful, on
22        purpose, intentional, and justifying in this
23        setting because you've been entitled to say so,
24        an expression of moral condemnation from you
25        that says -- MR. FURR:  I object, Your Honor.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- we want you to --
3              MR. FURR:  That's an improper --
4              Please don't talk over my objection, sir.
5              Your Honor, that's an improper argument.
6              THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, stick to the
7        legal instructions.
8              Ladies and gentlemen, you will be guided
9        by the legal instructions.
10              Please go ahead, sir.
11              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now --
12              MR. FURR:  And, Your Honor, could he be
13        cautioned not to talk over my objections --
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I didn't talk over his
15        objection, Your Honor.
16              MR. FURR:  -- so I don't have to raise my
17        voice?
18              THE COURT:  All right.  When he makes an
19        objection, please stop, Mr. Schlesinger.
20              Go ahead.
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Here it says, there's a
22        backlog of youth who have refrained from taking
23        up smoking in the face of the report.  A
24        substantial number of these can be expected to
25        join with this year's crop of prospects to produce a healthy increase in the number of new
2        smokers.
3              So the youth that slowed down because of
4        the warning, they were really -- they were
5        really satisfied that, despite this backlog of
6        youth, they could be expected to join with this
7        year's crop -- "a crop" -- of prospects to
8        produce a healthy increase in the number of new
9        smokers.
10              Again, you're referring to people, youth,
11        that are going to become addicted, that are
12        going to be lifelong smokers, that are going to
13        deny -- that are going to die, and you're going
14        to replace them as replacement smokers with
15        more youth?
16              That -- that doesn't meet with the bounds
17        of human decency, just plain and simple.
18              The next one we'll go to --
19              I want to go to the instruction for
20        punitive damages, please.
21              Now, you have to realize, this is an
22        industrially created epidemic.  And what do I
23        mean by that?
24              This isn't a disease that's being
25        eradicated because it's polio or malaria, that we have a pill.  There is a powerful industry.
2        And you heard Dr. Proctor talk about the
3        overwhelming power of this industry, and how it
4        invaded every part of society.  This is a
5        powerful industry that is driving, driving with
6        all of its might and all of its force, the
7        perpetuation of this epidemic.
8              Now, when --
9              This is the highest standard of proof,
10        the highest burden of proof we have to prove to
11        you that punishment is warranted for people who
12        document, the smartest people, the brightest
13        people:  The Claude Teagues, the Princeton
14        graduates, the people that should be curing
15        cancer, not causing cancer; the people that
16        should be protecting youth, not addicting
17        youth; the people that should not have doubt as
18        their product.
19              How different would our world have been
20        if, in 1953, when they knew full well and when
21        Dr. Teague knew full well it was causing
22        cancer, and in the early '60s, when they knew
23        indisputably it was causing cancer --
24              And you can't wrap your mind around it,
25        but imagine if they had come out and said, oh, my God, oh, my God, mass marketing -- mass
2        production led to mass marketing, led to mass
3        addiction, and now we, as a responsible titan
4        of industry, captains of industry, the folks
5        that are -- that are the most high echelon in
6        the country, would have said, we have to stop,
7        we have to take our responsibility, we cannot
8        make this product, we cannot make the product,
9        but instead, what did they make?
10              They made mass hypnosis.  And they said,
11        we're going to hire public relations people,
12        and we're going to take responsibility to make
13        it safe or get out of the business.
14              Well, you know why I want to talk about
15        did George Banks rely?  If they had got out of
16        the business, there wouldn't be cigarettes in
17        the '50s, and George Banks would have lived the
18        rest of his years --
19              MR. FURR:  Objection, preemption.  Your
20        Honor, move for mistrial.
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- that he was entitled
22        to have.
23              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, that's
24        not a proper argument.  Please follow the jury
25        instructions as I instructed you.  I sustain the objection.
2              MR. HEISE:  We'd move, as well, Your
3        Honor.
4              THE COURT:  The motion for mistrial is
5        denied.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is the -- this is
7        the --
8              Evidence that is precise, explicit,
9        lacking in confusion and of such weight that it
10        produces a firm belief or conviction, without
11        hesitation, about the matter in issue.
12              There's no doubt about the doubt.  Their
13        product was doubt.  They sold it, they relied
14        on it.  It worked.  They studied it.  They knew
15        that the filters were getting people to
16        continue to smoke.
17              They knew that making uncertainty in the
18        minds of people, particularly those dependent
19        on drugs, would undermine their ability to
20        continue -- to quit smoking and they would
21        continue.
22              There's no doubt about the doubt.  The
23        doubt is part of the conspiracy, it's part of
24        the Engle findings; and so this burden of proof
25        is the burden of proof that allows you to say, the evidence is clear, it's explicit, we're not
2        confused by it, there's no confusion --
3              There was a confusion campaign by
4        tobacco, but here, you have the right to
5        determine from the evidence that you were not
6        confused.  You have the right to determine that
7        it's clear.
8              And with that high standard of proof, you
9        have the right to determine that punishment is
10        warranted, and that these folks should be
11        punished for what they did.
12              So let's go to a couple of the documents.
13        Let's go to the PT03615 -- this board.
14      (Discussion off the record between counsel.)
15              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I don't know.  It
16        doesn't have a number on it.  Just put one up.
17              So this is the truth about their
18        business.  This is the internal truth about the
19        chemical compound, nicotine.
20              The cigarette market would collapse,
21        Philip Morris would collapse, and we would all
22        lose our jobs and our consulting fees.
23              And then they talked about -- and this is
24        Claude Teague again -- we can never be
25        comfortable selling a product which most of our customers would stop using if they could.  That
2        is to say, if the exit gate from our market
3        would suddenly open, we could be out of
4        business overnight.  That's --
5              Nicotine addiction is their business, and
6        that is the -- that is the basis of their
7        business.
8              I would like to show you that there was
9        no doubt that they knew that cigarettes were
10        carcinogenic.  These are all their internal
11        documents.
12              And way back in the '60s -- you've seen
13        this, this is in evidence -- carcinogens are
14        found in practically every class of compounds
15        of smoke.  Obviously, the evidence accumulated
16        to indict cigarette smoke as a health hazard is
17        overwhelming.  The evidence challenging such an
18        indictment is -- "such an," it's a
19        misspelling -- is scant.
20              And then another one here:  Cigarettes
21        have certain unattractive side effects.  They
22        cause lung cancer.  And yet the men that
23        promised to stop making it, the men that
24        promised to take this out -- these materials
25        out were not saying that because they truthfully wanted to take any of the stuff out
2        that was bad, or that they would stop making
3        it.  They never intended to do that.  It was
4        their way of reassuring the public that, in
5        fact, they could keep smoking.  And sure --
6        sure enough, they did.
7              Now, this is in evidence, the major
8        conclusions from the Surgeon General's report.
9        And I'm going to refer to it real quickly.
10              And you heard about how -- you heard
11        about -- yesterday with Dr. Hoge --
12              And I'm only going to speak about him for
13        a minute, because there's an instruction --
14              Yeah, we'll come to that.
15              We got this up, let's do this real quick.
16        These are the major conclusions.  This is
17        Surgeon General, 2014, and this just came out.
18              Here, find the major conclusions and I'll
19        read it.  I'll read it.
20              All right.  Thanks -- thanks, Jon.
21              All right.  So, this is 2014, 50 years
22        after the Surgeon General's report came out in
23        1964, the first Surgeon General's --
24              And I will show you the 1915 Surgeon
25        General, because I put that into evidence. One of the things that happened in
2        opening statement was I told you that when they
3        delayed incorporating the term "addiction" in
4        the '60s, in the first Surgeon General's
5        report -- remember I told you about that? --
6        and that they delayed by 25 years public
7        knowledge that nicotine was addictive, and it
8        wasn't until Surgeon General Koop put it in the
9        report in 1988, that it became widely
10        publicized even though that conclusion was
11        attacked and called -- was denigrated by
12        tobacco, tobacco delayed, by decades, the
13        recognition by the public and the public health
14        authority of the fact that nicotine was
15        addictive even though internally they said, we
16        possess a knowledge of nicotine far greater
17        than any other public health scientists.
18              They knew it was addicted -- addictive,
19        they delayed the recognition of it for decades,
20        and it didn't appear as addictive in a Surgeon
21        General's report until 1988.
22              What year did George Banks quit?  1988,
23        right?  We have evidence two years before 1990,
24        he quit in 1988.  Knowledge is out there,
25        information is out there.  George Banks was aware of the 1964 report because everybody was
2        aware of the 1964 report.
3              How about George Banks was aware of the
4        1988 finding that nicotine addiction was now
5        something that the public health officials and
6        the famous Dr. Koop said it's addictive?  And
7        that played a role in why he quit.
8              That's reliance.  That shows had they
9        have told him sooner, had they have shown him
10        earlier, he would have had a chance to quit
11        earlier, he would have had a chance to live and
12        not die when he did from esophageal cancer, and
13        had additional life expectancy.
14              They did not tell him that they were
15        hiding the truth about addiction.  They did not
16        tell him that they were foisting lies and
17        conspiratorial deceit on health reassurance to
18        make people think filters would be better --
19        and he smoked filters -- or that -- that you
20        didn't have to worry about it, time is on your
21        side, it's still an open question.
22              They had a Traveling Truth Squad.  It was
23        a traveling hit squad.  All they did was run
24        around and lie.  And it's like a negative
25        campaign.  They're liars -- MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor,
2        inflammatory rhetoric about squads.
3              THE COURT:  Again, sir, stick to the
4        evidence, please.
5              MR. SCHLESINGER:  They're telling lies.
6              What do you do to your opponent?  Call
7        him a liar.  They're raising doubt and
8        confusion.
9              What do you do to your opponent?  He's
10        raising doubt and confusion.  But the fact is,
11        is we know, in 1988, that's when the Surgeon
12        General said "addiction."
13              And I'll show you.  I put into evidence
14        the 1915 Surgeon General's report, because in
15        the beginning, in opening statement, Mr. Furr,
16        a fine lawyer, a powerful advocate for his
17        client, I take nothing away from him, but he is
18        not R.J. Reynolds, but he got up and said,
19        after I made an opening --
20              And, you know, we talked about ego
21        yesterday with this fine Dr. Hoge, we talked
22        about him --
23              You know, look, everybody's got an ego.
24        I got an ego.  But sometimes when you have an
25        ego, it reminds you to do something.  And I say there was confusion.
2              I -- I said:  Tobacco wasn't determined
3        to be addictive by the public surgeon until
4        1988, and it was delayed for decades, and --
5        and I believe -- it doesn't matter what I
6        believe -- and the evidence supports that
7        contention, but Mr. Furr got up and referred to
8        what I said in opening statement.
9              And he said:  Mr. Schlesinger said that
10        the Surgeon General of the United States did
11        not announce tobacco to be addictive until
12        1988, and then there was a pause, and in the
13        transcript -- and I can show it to you --
14        there's one word, a single declarative
15        utterance from Mr. Furr:  False.
16              And that got my ego, because I'm saying
17        to myself, Mr. Furr is saying I said something
18        false, and he's saying it to you, I am being
19        false.
20              So, I looked carefully, I looked very
21        closely.
22              You may have to put that up.
23              And we have in evidence the Surgeon
24        General's 1915 report, and it does not say
25        anything about a warning of smoking being addictive.  It doesn't say it.  That was a
2        false statement.  The Surgeon General of the
3        United States did not make that statement at
4        that time.
5              Here's what they did:  And I say there's
6        a little bit of something here that you should
7        consider as to whether or not it's completely
8        candid and forthright.  Because they also said
9        my client died alone, and I'm going to address
10        that.  I'm going to address that, as well.
11              But here it says:  Warnings about the
12        addictiveness of cigarettes, 1915.  Surgeon
13        General report, 1915.  Dr. Blue is the Surgeon
14        General in 1915.
15              And then it's got a quote over here,
16        "smoking is addictive."  And the -- the
17        implication was, as early as 1915, when my
18        client was two years old --
19              And there's no reason to think he ever
20        saw it; but if everything that is out there is
21        seen by everybody -- no implication he saw
22        it -- it says, smoking is addictive, and then
23        there's a document here that they point to.
24              Well, that document is not the Surgeon
25        General's report.  That document is a public health bulletin.  It was the garment workers
2        district that asked the Surgeon General to
3        study diseases in the garment workers, and some
4        other doctor named Simenewski (phonetic) did a
5        report, and there's --
6              The word "addiction" appears in the
7        report, and it doesn't say smoking is
8        addictive.  The word in the report, which I
9        don't even know if this report is even in
10        evidence, said that pipe tobacco and cigarette
11        smoking are smoked by the garment workers in
12        these dusty factories, in these relative
13        amounts, and most of it is cigarette smoking,
14        and it said, smoke -- cigarette smoking was the
15        most popular form of tobacco addiction.
16              It was a descriptive term of something in
17        a document that's not the Surgeon General's
18        report.  It didn't say smoking is addictive; it
19        said that of three kinds of smoking in 1915,
20        the cigarette smoking was, quote, the most
21        popular form of tobacco addiction.
22              And through the power of crunching and
23        reading and extracting, they found a word in a
24        document and they turned it into this:  A board
25        they showed you that they said was -- that the Surgeon General report says smoking is
2        addictive and, therefore, there was a warning.
3        None of that is true.
4              And I put in the actual 1915 report.  You
5        can't find the word "addiction" in there,
6        because it isn't in there, except having
7        something to do with morphine.  There's nothing
8        in there about cigarettes.
9              Now, we're talking about the health
10        warning the Surgeon General put -- now let's go
11        back to the -- we're talking about the warning
12        the Surgeon Generals made when smoking and
13        health became a public health issue with John
14        F. Kennedy in the '60s, and has gone on for 50
15        years since then.
16              This is an irrelevancy, but it is also
17        not a legitimate and -- and honorable way to
18        truly tell you what's going on.  It's
19        confusing, it's misleading, it raises doubt
20        that you shouldn't have.
21              MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I object to the
22        personal attacks by counsel.
23              THE COURT:  Overruled.
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now, the major
25        conclusions -- One of the things I've got to tell you,
2        one of the things is, we don't know how much
3        evidence you need.  You know, they used to have
4        a little TV show, the Gong Show, when somebody
5        could finally come out, hit the gong, and
6        they're like, that's it, stop.
7              You guys don't have that button.  So, in
8        an abundance of caution, we sometimes go too
9        far.  Maybe you could have gotten some of this
10        in a week -- we're saving a week -- because I
11        want you to come back on Monday, but we've
12        saved a week.
13              So here are the major conclusions:  This
14        is hot off the press.  This is brand new.  This
15        is available to any member of the public.  It
16        was announced at the White House.  Dr. Proctor
17        was there.
18              Proctor, Cummings, DiFranza -- the
19        leaders, the titans in the public health battle
20        against the scourge of cigarette disease and
21        death in this country -- we brought you
22        witnesses from the Surgeon General's report.
23        We brought you legitimate titans in the
24        industry, and they wanted to talk about the
25        money they earned. All in, the money they earned in this
2        case was less than what Dr. Hoge earned in this
3        one case.  They didn't earn 70,000 together.
4        Traube --
5              Traube and -- and Proctor and DiFranza,
6        together, their billing, when you heard it, it
7        didn't add up to the 70,000 of an unqualified
8        expert, who you have the right -- and I'll show
9        you the instruction -- to reject his opinions.
10              I told you, you have great power.  This
11        is the most power you'll ever have in your life
12        for some of you, and it's a -- it's the
13        greatest act a citizen can perform.  This is a
14        serious business.
15              And the Judge lets the witness testify,
16        because he also tells you, you've heard what a
17        technical opinion is by an expert.  These guys
18        are like, you go, we'll figure out where you're
19        going and we'll follow you and put it on.
20              THE COURT:  That's your 45-minute
21        warning.
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.  Thank you, Judge.
23      (Discussion off the record between counsel.)
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yeah, I know.
25              So it says here:  You've heard opinion testimony from persons referred to as expert
2        witnesses.  You may give it such weight as you
3        think it deserves.  But here's the key:  You
4        may reject it, considering the knowledge,
5        skill, experience and training of the witness.
6              I don't want to spend a lot of time with
7        Dr. Hoge.  You saw him yesterday.  It came out
8        the way it came out.  If it took too long to do
9        it, like I said, we don't know how much
10        information you need.
11              My point is this:  You can reject him.
12        So Dr. Hoge, a bowling ball, and you roll him
13        right down the lane and out of that courtroom,
14        you reject his opinion, because it serves no
15        beneficial opinion to finding the truth and the
16        justice in this case.  None.
17              However, this is what you should look at,
18        as well:  The century-long epidemic --
19        remember, Dr. Hoge didn't know what that was --
20        the century-long epidemic of cigarette smoking
21        has caused an enormous avoidable public health
22        tragedy.  Since the first Surgeon General's
23        report in 1964, more than 20 million premature
24        deaths can be attributed to cigarette smoking.
25              Next, Number 2:  The tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been sustained by the
2        aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry
3        which has deliberately misled the public on the
4        risks of smoking cigarettes.
5              Now, that is a portentous statement,
6        because the Surgeon General, they are not in
7        the business of public relations and
8        advertising to make money on a deadly and
9        lethal product.
10              They are in the business of carefully
11        reviewing legitimate scientific evidence, not
12        false evidence, not evidence planted by people
13        into the halls of the AMA and Harvard and the
14        DSM, where even Dr. Hoge, we know, a consultant
15        for tobacco, is now writing how the document
16        should be used for forensic purposes.
17              That's scary, because they tried with the
18        DSM-III; they're still doing it today.  The
19        evidence came from the witness stand by
20        Dr. Hoge's own admission.  He didn't make the
21        right choice.  He should have disqualified
22        himself from that committee, and he admitted it
23        and he didn't, and he also admitted nicotine
24        played a role in this gentleman's cigarette
25        smoking. Nobody smokes 50 years for pleasure,
2        taste, satisfaction.  That is just -- that is
3        nonsensical statements to sell a product, to
4        show health and sports figures and glamorous
5        celebrities.
6              And Philip Morris says:  You smoke, and
7        something wonderful happens.
8              Remember that video?  Something Wonderful
9        Happens.
10              Yeah, it's wonderful.  You get emphysema,
11        you get esophageal cancer, your body is
12        wracked, eaten alive, you decompensate and you
13        die.  There's nothing wonderful about it.
14              The tobacco epidemic was initiated and
15        has been sustained by the aggressive strategies
16        of the tobacco industry, which has deliberately
17        misled the public on the risks of smoking.
18              And that goes right along with the
19        findings in Engle.  They concealed and omitted
20        material information not otherwise known to the
21        public, with the intent that people would rely.
22        And the reliance comes from the fact that
23        saturation advertising was immersive.  They
24        didn't tell them the truth.
25              And in the '80s, when they finally did in 1988, isn't it an interesting coincidence and
2        can't we tie together that that's when he quit
3        smoking?
4              Let's go back to the --
5              Go to Number 6 -- go to Number 9.
6              Let's take a second here.  I want you to
7        think about this:  I want you to think about
8        this because --
9              I'll tell you why after I tell you,
10        because I've got to tell you in the right way
11        for it to have the kind of impact that I think
12        it's going to have.  I think it's clever.
13        Maybe that's because it's absurd.
14              THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, please make
15        arguments.
16              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.  I'm sorry, Judge.
17              We are Floridians, but we are also
18        Americans.  We live in the State of Florida, a
19        beautiful state.  Some of us were born and
20        raised here.
21              Now, I want you to think about this
22        image.  Conjure this image up in your mind.
23        You go out on I-95 and you start driving north
24        and there aren't any cars.  No cars.  And when
25        you pass the gas stations, there's no gas stations.  And if you stop in a strip mall,
2        there's nobody there.  And if you go to your
3        friends' homes, they're not there.  And if you
4        go to a church, or a school, or a courthouse,
5        or a hospital, there's nobody there.
6              And then you go to the populated parts of
7        the coast, and you go to Palm Beach, and you go
8        to Jacksonville, and you go to Tallahassee, and
9        you go down to Tampa.  And everywhere you
10        drive, there's skyscrapers, the lights aren't
11        on and there's nobody there.  It's the middle
12        of a beautiful day.  There's nobody there.  Not
13        a single soul.
14              Then you go to the central part of the
15        state.  You say, I'm going to go up on the Lake
16        Wales Ridge, and I'm going to drive up and down
17        Sebring.  And I'm going to go out to Hardee
18        County, and I'm going to go look in Zolfo
19        Springs.  And I'm going to go to the farmlands
20        in the State of Florida.  There's nobody there.
21              I'm going to go down to the Keys.  I'm
22        going to drive down to Islamorada and Duck Key.
23        I'm going to go to Marathon, I'm going to stop
24        in Key West, and I'm going to look for
25        somebody.  There's nobody there.  Not a single solitary soul in the entire State of Florida.
2        No traffic jams.  No -- no fire trucks, no
3        firemen, no policemen.  Nothing, nobody, empty.
4              The State of Florida like it was when
5        panthers roamed the beaches.  Imagine that.
6        Not a single, solitary soul in the State of
7        Florida.  That's 20 million people.  That's the
8        population of the State of Florida.
9              So if you want to think about --
10              MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.  This
11        is talking about --
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  If you --
13              MR. HEISE:  -- State Farm/Williams, harm
14        to others.
15              THE COURT:  Overruled.
16              MR. SCHLESINGER:  If you want to think
17        about and put it into terms where --
18              Because here's my concern:  Numbers numb.
19        Numbers numb.  We throw out a term and it has
20        no meaning, because it's so big, it's
21        incomprehensible to the average person.
22              We know of tragedies that have occurred
23        in our recent memory that have taken lives of
24        folks, and we know how important they are, and
25        I won't invoke them here, because I will not degrade the memory of those things, but you can
2        think of them, but I --
3              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  This
4        is an improper argument, Your Honor.
5              THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, please stick
6        to the evidence.
7              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.
8              THE COURT:  None of this is in evidence.
9              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Twenty --
10              Go back up there.  The first number, the
11        first one.
12              Twenty million people are dead.  That is
13        harm to others.  I wanted to try to give you a
14        way of thinking about it in terms that
15        expresses the enormity of the harm.
16              They were all parts of somebody's family.
17        Somebody cared about them, and they cared about
18        somebody.  A parent, a mother, a husband, a
19        father, an aunty, an uncle, a grandparent.
20              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  This
21        is improper argument.
22              THE COURT:  Sustained.  This is not
23        proper.  This case is about George Banks,
24        ladies and gentlemen, as it's set forth in the
25        instructions.  This is improper argument.  I sustain the objection, so disregard --
2              MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I make a motion.
3              THE COURT:  So disregard the remarks.
4              The motion for mistrial is denied.
5              Go ahead, Mr. Schlesinger.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now to the last one, to
7        that -- to Number 9.
8              This is the current posture in our
9        current environment.  And it says that the
10        burden of death and disease from tobacco use in
11        the United States is overwhelmingly caused by
12        cigarettes and other combusted tobacco
13        products.  Rapid elimination of their use will
14        dramatically reduce this burden.
15              Let's go to my -- take the first -- the
16        concurring cause instruction, then the
17        pictograph, please.
18              So this is the legal cause instruction.
19        And you're going to hear it, you heard it read;
20        and it says blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
21              Let's go to the next one.
22              Let me show you what it means.  This is
23        what the concurring cause instruction means.
24              MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I object to this
25        board. Please take it down.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I've used this before,
3        Judge.
4              THE COURT:  Take it down until I see what
5        the objection is.
6              What's the objection, sir?
7              MR. FURR:  It's inflammatory.  I don't
8        know if you saw it, Your Honor.
9              MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's not inflammatory.
10              THE COURT:  Hand me the slide, please.
11              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Pardon me?
12              THE COURT:  Hand me the slide, please.
13              MR. FURR:  Prejudicial, inflammatory.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's my way of
15        explaining what I think the instruction means,
16        Your Honor.
17              THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, you cannot use
18        these --
19              You can use the demonstrative, sir, but
20        not with those headstones on there.  It's not
21        proper, it's inflammatory.  So I sustain the
22        objection on that.  If you want to use it some
23        other way, you can do that.
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.  Thank you,
25        Judge. All right.  Put up the instruction.
2              I wanted to give you a visual way of
3        understanding this instruction.
4              The point is this:  When you get to the
5        first question on the verdict form, which is
6        whether or not this gentleman was a class
7        member, which you will eventually get to,
8        that's --
9              You know, I'm trying to plot the way for
10        you to get to the question about punishment
11        damages.  All of the other questions are based
12        upon reasonable degrees of probability, what's
13        more likely than not.  And we talked about
14        there is no doubt about the doubt.
15              In these questions, George Banks gets the
16        benefit of the doubt, because the law says,
17        more likely than not, what is reasonable in
18        terms of what really happened.
19              The unrefuted evidence is he died of
20        esophageal cancer caused by smoking, but there
21        could very well have been a contributing cause
22        by alcohol.
23              And so what I wanted to show was that in
24        order to be regarded as a legal cause of
25        esophageal cancer and death, cigarette smoking need not be the only cause.  Cigarette smoking
2        may be a legal cause of esophageal cancer and
3        death even though it acts in combination with
4        alcoholic beverages like beer or whiskey --
5              THE COURT:  You can use that slide.  You
6        can use that slide in that way.
7              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.
8              In order to be regarded as a legal cause
9        of esophageal cancer and death, the cigarettes
10        need not be the only cause.
11              The cigarettes may be a legal cause of
12        esophageal cancer and death, even though it
13        operates in combination with alcohol -- I put a
14        beer up there.  It could have been whiskey,
15        beer, what have you.  The man drank, there's no
16        doubt about that -- if such beer, if such
17        alcohol, occurs at the same time as the
18        cigarettes and the cigarettes contributes
19        substantially to producing esophageal cancer
20        and death.  And they did.
21              And if he smoked a pack a day for 50
22        years, the minimum amount that, in the most
23        conservative analysis of the evidence in this
24        case, that nobody smokes without addiction, he
25        died of the disease that the Engle class says is caused by esophageal cancer, and Dr. Traube
2        said it was caused by esophageal cancer, and so
3        did Dr. DiFranza, and he said the man was
4        definitively addicted, which is dependent --
5              And don't forget this:  Dependence to
6        nicotine does not have to be the only cause.
7        Just like this:  Dependence to nicotine, which
8        is physiological dependence and everything that
9        goes with it, that incredibly hard drug to
10        quit, 20 million people have died, it kills
11        over half of its users, just because you are
12        addicted to the drug, and maybe some quit, or
13        he could have quit, and he did quit, it doesn't
14        mean he wasn't dependent to some extent all
15        those years that he was smoking.
16              So it's not an absolute.  He could have
17        been dependent and he could have enjoyed
18        smoking, even though the enjoyment of smoking
19        is driven by nicotine.
20              Relaxation by smoking is driven by the
21        fact that, as Yvonne said, when that nicotine
22        dies down in him, he needed to replenish it,
23        because withdrawal symptoms, shakes, things
24        like that, are signs of nicotine withdrawal,
25        and a lot of the relaxing effects of nicotine are because people are taking the drug to
2        relieve the withdrawal symptoms.
3              However, as long as nicotine -- you can
4        put up the question on the verdict form for
5        class membership, but put up the class
6        membership slide first -- as long as that
7        nicotine was an important cause, a substantial
8        contributing cause to why he smoked; and nobody
9        smokes a pack a day for 50 years --
10              They say themselves:  Without nicotine,
11        there is no smoking.  That's their internal
12        document from the '60s.  Without nicotine,
13        there is no smoking.  They say that themselves.
14              That pack minimum, pack a day for 50
15        years, it could have been as much as a pack and
16        a half or more, because he said greater than a
17        pack a day, for 60 years; but, in any event, it
18        was enough to kill him.  It did kill him by
19        esophageal cancer.  Addiction drove it.
20              And the simple statement I told you from
21        that song by The Fixx, One Thing Leads to the
22        Other:  Smoking defective, addictive cigarettes
23        that are unreasonably dangerous, one thing
24        leads to the other.
25              The nicotine leads to smoking, smoking leads to millions of inhalations of toxic,
2        poisonous, cancer-causing chemicals, that leads
3        to esophageal cancer.  And, in his case,
4        emphysema, permanent injury to his lungs, and
5        death.
6              You'll see a series of questions about
7        emphysema.  You're going to be able to probably
8        skip over all of those when you are comfortable
9        with the idea that the smoking was a
10        substantial contributing cause to his -- his
11        esophageal cancer.
12              But the emphysema questions are there if
13        for some reason you decide that in no way did
14        the smoking have any substantial role or
15        significant role in causing his -- his
16        esophageal cancer.
17              There's no evidence to that effect, but
18        the way the law is set up, the Judge has a
19        series of questions there; and there is
20        absolutely no doubt the emphysema was caused by
21        smoking, and so you would have to answer those
22        questions, but only if you -- if you did not
23        find that he was killed by the esophageal
24        cancer caused by the smoking.
25              And the evidence is so strong in that regard, we have enough confidence that that
2        won't be an issue, that we're not going to
3        spend time on those series of questions.
4              Follow the instructions carefully.  It's
5        a lot of like choosing from a menu.  If you do
6        1, then do 2; if you don't do 2, go do 3.
7              There's no way in the world you can
8        understand it when the Judge is reading to
9        it -- reading it to you, because you've got to
10        look at it yourself.  When you read it
11        yourself, if you read it really carefully,
12        you'll understand it and you'll follow it.
13              But Question 1 is, very simply, the --
14              Can you put up -- can you also put up the
15        definition of the Engle class?
16              We'll go to this, we'll go back.
17              Was --
18              There.
19              All Florida citizens and residents and
20        their survivors who have suffered, presently
21        suffer, who have died from diseases and medical
22        conditions caused by their addiction to
23        cigarettes that contain nicotine.
24              Now the board about --
25      (Discussion off the record between counsel.) MR. SCHLESINGER:  Go to that one.
2              So that's the Engle class definition.
3        That's the law.  All Florida residents and
4        their survivors.
5              He was a Florida resident, he smoked a
6        lot of cigarettes, he died of a
7        cigarette-related disease under Engle, it was
8        addictive, it was unreasonably dangerous and
9        defective.  They conspired and defrauded the
10        truth for decades, expecting folks to rely.
11              Mr. Heimann, whose video we had, said
12        they expected folks to rely.  They did rely.
13        Their sales went up.  The proof is in the
14        pudding.  And you can infer from all of this
15        that George Banks was entitled to reliance.
16              And here's something you have to
17        understand:  How do you rely on something
18        that's concealed?
19              They concealed evidence not -- not known
20        or otherwise admitted.  How do you rely on
21        something concealed?
22              Well, here's how you do it:  You think in
23        terms of what would reasonable men do.  You
24        think in terms of, was the lying and denying
25        about addiction, was the lying and denying about the fact that their product was reliably
2        causing cancer and killing their -- their
3        customers, was that --
4              Was the fact that they hid it the kind of
5        information that would be important to a
6        reasonable man?  Was it material?
7              Would a reasonable man have wanted to
8        known that -- to know that?
9              And had they have known that, would it
10        have given them a chance?  With the -- the
11        benefit of the doubt in their favor that they
12        could have made a different choice sooner and
13        not succumbed to the horrible tobacco illness
14        that took this man's life so precipitously and
15        so surprisingly that his family had to come
16        running to figure out what happened.  And
17        fortunately we have the autopsy that proves it.
18              Right here, it says what class membership
19        is not about.  There should be no confusion.
20        Class membership is not about the fault of
21        either party.
22              It's very important to remember this.  On
23        that Question 1, was George Banks addicted to
24        cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if so, was
25        such addiction a legal cause of esophageal cancer and death, that first question, it's
2        a -- it is -- it's simplicity.
3              It's that picture I showed you of the
4        hand holding the smoke.  It's drug addiction.
5        It's all of the Surgeon Generals' reports,
6        saying it's the fundamental reason people
7        smoke, and that's why they get diseases.  It's
8        that series of boxes in the Surgeon General's
9        report, saying how addiction leads to cancer.
10        It's easy.
11              It can be made confusing, it can be made
12        complicated, it can be made to raise doubt and
13        uncertainty; but bottom line, bare minimum,
14        not-in-dispute evidence gets you --
15              What happened?  Oh, okay.  Oh, sure.
16              A picture is worth a thousand words.
17        Let's go back to where I was.
18              Let's go back to where I was, please, the
19        last one, quickly, please.
20              Remember this.  And here is what I call a
21        trick.  The Engle progeny class members from
22        one end of the state to the other are entitled
23        to be in the class, and are not to be excluded
24        out of the class for any reasons that this
25        Judge does not advise you on.  He's not going to give you --
2              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
3        a complete misstatement of the law.
4              MR. SCHLESINGER:  He does not --
5              THE COURT:  Hang on, Mr. Schlesinger.
6              MR. FURR:  Excuse me, sir.  Please don't
7        talk when I'm objecting.
8              THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger.
9              Ladies and gentlemen, class membership is
10        defined in the instructions.  You will follow
11        the instructions as I have given you guidance
12        on.
13              Go ahead, Mr. Schlesinger.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  If I may.
15              You will not hear a definition of the
16        term "addiction" from this Court.  Addiction is
17        how it appears to you to be.  And dependence on
18        a drug and addiction on a drug --
19              And you heard it from Henning -- you
20        heard it from Cummings; you heard it from
21        Traube, he said our man was addicted.  You
22        heard it from the real expert, Dr. DiFranza,
23        who studies brains and permanent changes said
24        it was -- said he was addicted or dependent.
25              You're not going to hear the Judge say this is the legal definition of "addiction."
2        You're not going to hear the Judge say this is
3        the -- this is the medical consensus definition
4        of "addiction," because there's many different
5        ways to define "addiction."  And it can be
6        defined from the single symptom alone of
7        smoking a lot of cigarettes for a long period
8        of time.  So it's like -- you know, like some
9        people say, it's like mountains and seasons.
10        You know it when you see it.
11              And you have a business that is based
12        upon the center of their universe being
13        nicotine addiction.  They're in the nicotine
14        addiction business.  And you have a customer,
15        George Banks, who acted in total compliance
16        with everything they expected him to do, all
17        the way along his life.  So he was the
18        customer, just like many others, that they
19        expected him to be.
20              Class membership, that first question, is
21        he a class member, was he addicted to the
22        cigarettes containing nicotine, meaning was
23        that defective, addictive nature of that
24        cigarette that was in the cigarette such that
25        it caused him to get these diseases?  He did; we proved it.
2              However, class membership is not about
3        fault.  The first question is not about money.
4        The first question, when you answer it "yes"
5        and you move on, you haven't awarded any money,
6        you haven't compensated them, you haven't tried
7        to restore the family for the loss that you are
8        going to measure, the loss --
9              You're going to evaluate the
10        relationship, the good of the relationship, the
11        bad of the relationship, you're going to
12        contextualize it in terms of nuclear families
13        like the Brady Bunch that are together all the
14        time, and families for whatever circumstances
15        that aren't together all the time, and you're
16        going to decide, did he love them, did somebody
17        love George Banks, did Katrina love George
18        Banks, did she make enough of a -- of a
19        description of her feeling about her father
20        that you know he mattered to her, and do -- is
21        it normal and natural for people to care about
22        their parents even if they're imperfect?
23              So class membership is not about fault.
24        Fault comes in the next set of questions.  And
25        you can compare relative degrees of responsibility.
2              And we said we take some
3        responsibility -- the family authorized us --
4        in combination with what they did, which we say
5        is far worse, because it was on purpose.  Our
6        man was an innocent, whose human weaknesses,
7        his human imperfections, perhaps, prevented him
8        from trying harder to do a better job to quit.
9              And you can assess it and you can assign
10        percentages, but not on Question 1, which is
11        merely, is he in the Engle class that embraces
12        all Americans, all Floridians who fit the
13        description.  And it's got nothing to do with
14        fault.
15              Don't be -- don't be distracted by that,
16        that business about, even if he was addicted,
17        he could have quit.  Whether he could have quit
18        goes into whether or not there's fault.
19              Reliance on a statement from the tobacco
20        industry, that's not class membership.  Whether
21        addicts lose total control over their minds,
22        that's not class membership.  Whether addicts
23        can quit, we know they can, they can still be
24        addicts, and they can still be in the class.
25              How often George Banks drank alcohol, that doesn't enter into the class description.
2        You have to take that into consideration when
3        evaluating and measuring the harm to the
4        family, and measuring what role that played and
5        whether -- and to what extent he's partially at
6        fault.
7              If George, Yvonne and Katrina always
8        lived together in the same home --
9              Some folks go off and work on the Alaska
10        Pipeline.  Some folks are overseas.  Some folks
11        are comfortable in a place where they grew up,
12        and it's a slow, quiet place, and they decide
13        to stay there.
14              And for whatever reason, they were apart.
15        They were not separated; they were together.
16        They were together in enough ways that when you
17        know that all the way to the very end, right
18        before he got really sick and decompensated,
19        that you have letters going back and forth to
20        Katrina all the way up to mid-November, right
21        before they saw him and right before he really
22        became sick and died.
23              And, quite frankly, even though those
24        envelopes are empty, the envelopes are worth
25        more to this family than what was in them.  And they are also evidence of an ongoing
2        relationship with the person that was loved in
3        both directions.
4              That father, in those letters, always
5        expressed love to his daughter; and his
6        daughter always expressed love to him.  So
7        that's a real family.  They were not separated,
8        they were not divorced, they were not together.
9              And you will probably say, we're not
10        going to award as much money as we would, we're
11        not going to compensate with as much money as
12        we would if it was a different kind of family
13        that was more nuclear.
14              And he was 81 years old, so he only had
15        so many more years to live anyway.  He wasn't
16        going to live, in any likelihood, to a hundred.
17        He wouldn't have been here today, anyway.
18              But those last few years, and those few
19        visits, and whatever it was that they could be
20        together, she was still a minor in the eyes of
21        the law, at age 23, because minority ends for
22        wrongful death cases at 25.  They were still
23        entitled to that consideration.
24              And when you lose someone suddenly, it
25        hurts, and I think you saw, from Katrina, genuine ongoing pain that exists today.  I
2        think she told you in a way --
3              MR. FURR:  Objection to counsel's
4        personal opinions.
5              THE COURT:  Your personal opinions don't
6        matter.  You can comment on the evidence, sir.
7              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I think the evidence
8        shows that you can adjudge Katrina yourself.
9              So it doesn't matter if they lived
10        together for class membership, and it doesn't
11        matter how much time they spent for class
12        membership.  That's fault and amounts of money.
13              And I'm going to ask the Court to indulge
14        me and I'm going to continue on.
15              I am going to skip over the percentages
16        of fault, I'm going to skip over the -- the
17        amounts of money for wrongful death, and I want
18        to show you these other questions that you have
19        to talk to and answer.
20              Do you have the next one ready for me?
21              THE COURT:  You have about 20 minutes,
22        Mr. Schlesinger.
23              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you, Judge.
24              I'm going to help you navigate your way.
25        If you want to -- If you believe punitive damages are
2        warranted, if you believe that this company was
3        off the moral compass, placed profits over
4        human lives, and that there's sufficient
5        evidence from Dr. Proctor and all the documents
6        you'll have, the internal truths that they
7        admitted secretly they thought would never see
8        the light of day, I'm going to help you
9        navigate how to get there.
10              And there's a couple of questions here
11        which you looked at:  Did George Banks
12        reasonably rely to his detriment on any
13        statement of material fact made by R.J.
14        Reynolds and/or Philip Morris that concealed or
15        omitted material information concerning the
16        health effects of cigarettes or their addictive
17        nature; and, if so, was reliance a legal cause
18        of Mr. Banks' esophageal cancer?  Yes.
19              The answer to both of those questions
20        should be "yes," as they should be to the next
21        question with -- which is:  Did any of these
22        statements happen after 1982?
23              And we can play Horrigan, who is one of
24        the guys in 1984, saying, we still don't know
25        what causes cancer; we don't know if it does. You could play those chief executive
2        officers who, in '94, said, we don't admit
3        it's -- nicotine is addictive, but they were
4        still denying, they were still lying all during
5        this period of time.
6              And I want to show that reliance board,
7        okay?
8              So the reliance can be inferred.  You
9        don't have to put anything particular directly
10        in the man's hands, because there was nothing
11        personal about the public doubt campaign, there
12        was nothing personal about the Traveling Truth
13        Squad, the College of Tobacco Knowledge, Anne
14        Browder, and all these different folks that
15        went around the country saying that it's an
16        open controversy, can we have an honest debate,
17        the case of cigarettes is not closed, that was
18        meant for a population in whole, of which
19        Mr. Banks was a part, of which the evidence
20        from the Federal Trade Commission says the
21        Surgeon General has no chance against the
22        immersive, overwhelming advertising that
23        reaches every single person.
24              So this is an instruction where it says:
25        It is not necessary that a direct statement be made to George Banks in order to give rise to
2        the right to rely upon that statement.  It is
3        immaterial whether the statement passes through
4        a direct or circuitous channel in reaching
5        Mr. Banks, provided the statement is made with
6        the intent that it reach him and be acted upon
7        him.
8              However, George can't be found to
9        reasonably rely upon a statement if he knew of
10        its falsity or it was obvious to him, or if the
11        facts allegedly concealed was already known to
12        him.
13              Let's show what he couldn't have known.
14              Now, you may infer that there was nothing
15        personal about what the tobacco companies were
16        doing.  They were going for an overall message
17        to get people to continue smoking, to give
18        addicts a psychological crutch to rely on,
19        things like an illusion of filtration.
20              And, in fact, it worked.  Their sales
21        continued.  Their sales didn't stop.  It
22        worked, and it worked with George Banks.
23        George Banks quit in 1988, when the Surgeon
24        General said that nicotine was addictive.
25        Isn't that interesting? That's in the records.  That's reliance.
2        And that's all you need to know for George
3        Banks to be qualified, as one of many others
4        like him, to get to be able to have you
5        consider whether punishment is warranted,
6        whether the company did what the Engle findings
7        say they did, what all those internal documents
8        showed they did, and what Proctor called, you
9        know, just an -- a wall-to-wall conspiratorial
10        effort to defraud the American consumer.
11              So here's the thing:  How would things
12        have been different if the tobacco companies
13        came forward and admitted filters were a fraud?
14              R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris
15        manipulated nicotine and added chemicals to
16        make them more addictive, like ammonia, things
17        like that.
18              He didn't know that.  They didn't tell
19        him that.  That would have been material.
20        Would that have been important information?
21        Could he have relied on that to give him a
22        chance to stop smoking, that smoking is not a
23        choice, that, rather, the nicotine in his
24        cigarettes were as addictive as heroin and
25        cocaine? Nobody told him that before 1988, when
2        the Surgeon General told him that.  Would that
3        have been important information?  Would that
4        have been a responsible thing for a responsible
5        company to do to tell him?  By smoking Camel
6        and Marlboro cigarettes, that he had a
7        50 percent chance of dying?
8              No other product in the history of human
9        civilization, when used as intended, kills half
10        of its customers.  It's an anachronism in this
11        country.  It is -- it is incomprehensible that
12        such a thing could exist, and yet we've been
13        enured to it.  You know, they say it's a legal
14        product, and it is, but it's not.  It's not
15        legal to sell to underage people, and --
16              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
17              Excuse me, sir.
18              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, I
19        instructed you on cigarettes being a legal
20        product.  You'll follow my legal instructions.
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And not -- and -- and
22        you don't --
23              Underage smokers are the business --
24        replacement business, absolutely.  If they
25        wanted to be responsible and they wanted to do something different, and they said -- because
2        we're under the FDA now, whatever -- cigarettes
3        are a drug, they're a drug-delivery device,
4        it's hard to wrap your mind around it, but
5        they're nothing but a drug, which, as I showed
6        you that hand, it's drug addiction -- say,
7        we're going to put them behind a pharmacy
8        counter, we're going to have the pharmacists
9        release them, and nobody under 21 is ever going
10        to get a cigarette, and you would knock
11        smoking --
12              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  This
13        is --
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- down by 90 percent
15        in this country.
16              MR. FURR:  This is not a comment on the
17        evidence, Your Honor.
18              THE COURT:  I agree.  This is not.  I
19        sustain the objection.
20              Ladies and gentlemen, these comments are
21        confined to the evidence.  Your deliberations
22        are confined to the evidence, not the personal
23        comments of either -- all -- all three
24        attorneys in the case.
25              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. -- THE COURT:  You may proceed.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. --
3              MR. FURR:  Make a motion, Your Honor.
4              THE COURT:  Motion for mistrial is
5        denied, sir.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. Proctor testified
7        that the things you could do to make the
8        product safer and less dangerous is to make it
9        not addictive by taking out the nicotine to a
10        level below the ability to sustain addiction,
11        or to raise the pH so it wasn't inhalable.
12              So you would have mouth-puffing instead
13        of lung-sucking, and the poisons wouldn't get
14        in, and you wouldn't smoke as many, you
15        wouldn't have to smoke a pack of cigarettes a
16        day and take in all those nicotine hits to the
17        brain, and associated carcinogens.
18              He also said you raise the pH, it stays
19        in the mouth, it doesn't go in the lungs, it's
20        not nearly as addictive.
21              They would still have a business.  It
22        wouldn't be as big a business, but it would
23        still be a business.
24              So there are responsible ways that they
25        could even stay in business and think of ways to go forward, help their customers instead of
2        consuming them.
3              And I say America is this industry's
4        ashtray.  They stub out a --
5              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- half a million --
7              MR. FURR:  Excuse me.
8              THE COURT:  Sustained.
9              Mr. Schlesinger, that is a completely
10        improper argument, sir.
11              MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I make a motion
12        for mistrial.
13              THE COURT:  I sustain the objection.
14              Your motion for mistrial is under
15        advisement, sir.
16              You may continue.
17              MR. SCHLESINGER:  The material
18        information concealed and omitted from George
19        Banks, that would have mattered, it says here
20        that the statements of scientists were giving
21        psychological crutches, doubt about health risk
22        and self-rationales, were paid for by the
23        tobacco industry to keep addicted smokers
24        smoking their deadly product.  The tobacco --
25              George Banks didn't know that.  The tobacco companies expected him to rely upon
2        their lies, to continue smoking their
3        addictive, cancer-causing cigarettes, their
4        defective, cancer-causing cigarettes.  Heimann
5        admitted it, and it's an Engle finding.
6              What they did, their lies, their
7        conspiracy, their defraud, was with the intent
8        that smokers would rely.  The proof is in the
9        pudding.  The sales went up.
10              That all of their efforts were carefully
11        planned, carried out, and successful, according
12        to their very own documents.  They were.  He
13        didn't know that.
14              They chose not to go out of business even
15        though they promised to do so.  They made a
16        promise.  They said, we'll stop making it.
17        Several times by James Bowling and several
18        others.  In -- on television, in writing.  But
19        that promise --
20              The real reason for that promise was to
21        give false reassurance.
22              And then they didn't remove the
23        carcinogens and harmful chemicals even though
24        they promised to do so.
25              Let's play that tape, that montage, please.  We have a brief montage of some of
2        what the folks said after 1982, because the
3        question after 1982 is --
4              Essentially, you check that "yes" to get
5        to punitives.  And the important reason why is
6        because the conspiracy never ended until at
7        least 2000, when they finally had to admit it
8        was addictive and caused cancer.
9              But in an unbroken arc from 1953, all the
10        way through 1994, when you saw the chief
11        executive officers lying to Congress, and all
12        the way through the year 2000, it was an
13        unbroken conspiracy.
14              So for -- for certain technical purposes
15        I can't even explain, the Judge has given this
16        ruling, you want to get to be able to determine
17        that punitive damages are warranted, you must
18        check off post-'82 on one of the two questions
19        that allow you to do so.
20              Let's play this, please.

15        in general right now, so I think that we may
16        find out what causes cancer, and we may find

10        often the choice between physical health of

12        tobacco industry, concealment was chosen over

6        that they said --
7              I want to do this real quick.  This was
8        one of the opening boards.
9              And during opening, you know, there
10        was -- there was a moment there --
11              I mean, it had some -- it had some -- it
12        had some power.  Jeff Furr, I said he's a
13        powerful lawyer.  He said something that --
14        that -- it made my heart -- it made --
15              I could imagine that the evidence would
16        make a person's heart sink for a moment, until
17        I thought about it.  And he said that --
18              He pointed out a medical record, and it
19        said that they called the Banks family to
20        advise them of his deteriorating condition, and
21        that he was advised that he was not going to
22        live many more days and they should come visit
23        soon, and that Yvonne and Katrina Banks did not
24        go back to that hospital, and Mr. Banks died
25        alone. And I thought about that, and I looked
2        closely, just like I looked closely at the 1915
3        Surgeon General's report.  And when you look at
4        the record and you read the record, where it
5        says he was advised he was not going to live
6        many more days and they should visit soon,
7        actually what it says is:  She was advised that
8        the patient may not live many more days -- this
9        is a quote from the record in evidence -- she
10        expressed a plan to visit him as soon as she
11        could, but had some fear she might not be able
12        to visit him within the next several -- within
13        the next days.  She was assured that the
14        patient's comfort needs were being met, and
15        that the staff would provide gentle, comfort
16        care in her absence.
17              It does not say she was told to come in,
18        and it does not say he was not going to live
19        many more days.  It said he may or may not live
20        many more days.
21              And George Banks did not die alone.  He
22        died in the care of caring Hospice people.  The
23        family was sending their love.  This was after
24        they had gone to the hospital and they had
25        stayed with him for days, and they transferred him to a different hospital.  And then, because
2        of circumstances --
3              Not everybody can afford to do things.
4        Different people have different hardships in
5        life.  This is -- this is America.  Different
6        families go through different levels of
7        difficulty.
8              They did what they had to do to bring a
9        daughter he wanted to see get through college,
10        back to college to continue her classes.
11              They wanted to be back; and saying the
12        man died alone derogates the loss to these --
13        to this family, because they buried him, and
14        they went to the funeral, and they were there,
15        and they grieved for him.
16              There was nobody named Lampe or Hall or
17        anybody else there.  It was just his family,
18        the next of kin that is documented in the
19        medical record.  When they said, who's the
20        emergency contact, it was somebody else.  That
21        same record says, next of kin, and
22        identifies -- identifies Yvonne Banks.
23              So I say, you can consider, is that a
24        fully candid appraisal -- you can take it
25        down -- in assessing, trying to say that this man was neglected and died alone?
2              He became terribly, suddenly ill.  He had
3        a sudden, catastrophic deterioration that
4        Dr. Traube says is common in such horrible
5        cancers as esophageal cancer.
6              And they had letters up till
7        mid-November, proving they had ongoing contact,
8        and they have a marriage certificate and a
9        birth certificate and they fit everything you
10        need to know about class -- belonging into a
11        class.
12              THE COURT:  You have four minutes,
13        Mr. Schlesinger.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you, Judge.
15              I guess I'm going to have to talk about
16        the amounts of money for -- for -- and the
17        comparative fault.
18              I think that because the Philip Morris
19        cigarettes --
20              He clearly smoked the Marlboro cigarettes
21        over a prolonged period of time, but there's
22        also evidence that there's some confusion
23        there.  Katrina said he smoked them a bunch.
24              You know, they're a part of the
25        conspiracy.  And on the punishment claims, they can't get away with being a part of the
2        conspiracy even if they didn't -- even if he
3        didn't smoke a lot of cigarettes.
4              So they're not going to get the same
5        level of percentage of fault as RJR is, but I
6        still say that he's an innocent, and he was
7        better than they were, and whatever the fault
8        breakdown should be, it should be greater for
9        them, in total, than for him.
10              He never knew at any time until at least
11        the '60s, when the Surgeon Generals came out
12        and the warning labels came out.  Even the FTC,
13        in 1967, said the warning labels were useless.
14        They never changed.  They haven't changed since
15        1985.
16              So that's not the be-all and end-all.
17        And the man was addicted well before they were
18        warning him.  But the point is, we bear some
19        responsibility.  We want to bear our fair share
20        of blame.
21              We want you to give us our fair share of
22        blame as long as you recognize it's in the
23        context of a man with a sixth-grade education,
24        that did the best he could.  But one thing he
25        wasn't was -- He might have been weak.  He wasn't a
2        liar.
3              So if you give him ten, 12-and-a half or
4        15 percent of the blame, and you give at least
5        50 percent of the blame or more to R.J.
6        Reynolds, you can give the rest to Philip
7        Morris.  But as long as their individual blame
8        exceeds his blame, that is a powerful message,
9        saying what he did wrong isn't nearly as bad as
10        what you did wrong.
11              So 50 percent for Philip Morris (sic),
12        ten to 15 percent for my client, and up to
13        35 percent for Philip Morris.  They've been
14        nice and quiet over there, and that's fine; but
15        they're still part of the conspiracy, and you
16        saw a lot of their documents that talked about
17        what they did.
18              Now, as far as money is concerned,
19        it's --
20              What?
21      (Discussion off the record between counsel.)
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Oh, and by the way,
23        when you get to those intentional torts, the
24        on-purpose things, the things they did to lie
25        to him and deceive him, that he could have reasonably relied on like a reasonable man, if
2        you award an intentional fault check mark, he
3        won't get any reduction for the percentages.
4              I know it's a little complicated, and you
5        don't really have to trouble yourself with it,
6        but he'll get full benefits.  He won't get
7        15 percent knocked off, is what I'm saying.  If
8        you award --
9              If you move forward through the punitive
10        damages, to get to the punishment, I say, which
11        is why we're here, which is where I want you to
12        be, and I want to see you on Monday, if you see
13        this case our way, if we've stitched it
14        together the right way, that's how it will be.
15              And then I want to just tell you this:
16        We have to come up with an amount of money.
17        It's an unknown thing.  It's a human amount.
18        It's whatever you guys think it is.  It isn't
19        what I think it is.  And I -- and I don't want
20        to suggest to you --
21              Yvonne is never going to see any of this
22        money.  She's not going to live to see this
23        money.  This is an award where you measure the
24        magnitude of the loss, and you say to the -- to
25        my clients, through your verdict -- through your verdict, we see what happened, we place
2        value on your loss, we measure the magnitude of
3        your loss, we place value on it, we recognize
4        it was hard, we recognize it wasn't perfect.
5              We recognize the man drank.  The duration
6        of drinking, the precision of the quantity of
7        drinking is very unclear from that record, but
8        we acknowledge he had an alcohol problem.  It's
9        contributing.  It contributes to the
10        relationship, it contributes to the smoking, it
11        could have been a part of how he got esophageal
12        cancer; but it's a distraction.  You should
13        keep your eye on the ball.  It's not what this
14        case is about.
15              You could award them any amount of money
16        you want.  I don't even know what a fair amount
17        to suggest is.  You could award them a million
18        dollars apiece for the loss of their family
19        member.  If that's --
20              You could award them two, or you could
21        award them three.  If they -- if this was a
22        super nuclear family, with no problems, no
23        issues, nothing, I would ask for six or eight
24        or $10 million apiece for the family member as
25        restoration for what they lost. This is a different situation.  He wasn't
2        going to live that long, anyway, maybe into his
3        90s.  They were only going to have a few years
4        with him.
5              So it's up to you.  You could award him
6        five -- you could award them 500,000.  You
7        could decide it's 500,000 apiece.  I am not
8        sure.  But you dignify the loss if you believe
9        it was an unnecessary, premature, preventable
10        death because of a deadly, dangerous product.
11        And it is a number from which you will then
12        calculate punishment.  The punishment must be
13        related to the compensatory damages.
14              So if it's in your heart and in the
15        proofs, and you see it our way and you can
16        consider providing a meaningful level of
17        compensation, you know, it's --
18              Everyone says it's all about the money.
19        If it's all about the money, the experts, my
20        clients, if it's all about the money, what is
21        it to them?  If it's all about the money, who
22        is it the most -- who is the money the most
23        important to in this courtroom?
24              And I say it's the cigarette companies,
25        and that's why the fine is a way of you telling them, we don't approve of this, this is
2        indecent human behavior.
3              And I want to end with this last thing.
4        And I thank the Court's indulgence for letting
5        me go over.
6              I want to say this one thing:  There's a
7        great author, and I thought about it in this
8        case, because Francis Bacon said that knowledge
9        was power, but George Orwell said that
10        ignorance was strength.
11              And Dr. Proctor explained the nature and
12        power and the strength and the success and the
13        money tobacco companies have made from sowing
14        the seeds of doubt and ignorance for decades.
15              Ignorance is strength.  Orwell was a
16        post-Apocalyptic version of how topsy-turvy the
17        world could get.  War is peace.  Ignorance is
18        strength.
19              And here's something he said, and I want
20        you to think about it if -- if you feel this
21        case has validity, if you see it our way.
22              And the scene was played by Richard
23        Burton and John Hurt, in the movie "1984," on
24        the book by George Orwell.  It's standard
25        reading.  Some folks have read it, some folks haven't.
2              Our man, with a sixth-grade education, he
3        didn't see any high school books in Georgia.
4              But this book, George Orwell, famous
5        book, John Hurt is laid out to be tortured by
6        Big Brother, Richard Burton, he's a powerful
7        actor, powerful, powerful men that provoke
8        great emotion on the screen, and the words on
9        the page are every bit as powerful.
10              Winston was the man played by John Hurt,
11        and he was the one that was about to be
12        tortured.  He said we --
13              MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  All --
15              MR. HEISE:  "Torture" references.  This
16        is not in evidence.  This is entirely improper
17        argument.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Forget "torture,"
19        Judge.  I take that back.
20              THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead and
21        finish, sir.
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Above all, we do not
23        let a --
24              Excuse me.
25              Richard Burton talking to John Hurt, so you have a mental picture.  Above all, we do
2        not allow the dead to rise up against us.  You
3        must stop imagining that posterity will
4        vindicate you, Winston.  Posterity will never
5        hear of you.  You will be lifted clean out from
6        the stream of history.  We shall turn you into
7        a gas and pour you into the stratosphere.
8        Nothing will remain of you; not a name in a
9        register, not a memory in a living brain.  You
10        will be annihilated in the past, as well as in
11        the future.  You will have never existed.
12              And I suggest to you, ladies and
13        gentlemen of the jury, that cigarettes and
14        tobacco took this man from his family before
15        his time, and that some of the things in this
16        courtroom, where they blamed the victim and ran
17        him down because of this issue about
18        drinking --
19              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
20        Objection.
21              THE COURT:  Overruled.
22              Finish, please.
23              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- tries to take away
24        some of the memories that Katrina has of the
25        father she loved. And it is not what somebody else thinks
2        about you that defines your worth.  And he was
3        worth something to somebody.  He was worth
4        something to his family.
5              And no matter how little his worth, as
6        exemplified in this courtroom, he was better
7        than them; and you will send them a powerful
8        message by saying, you can't do this to people,
9        even --
10              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.
11              THE COURT:  That is completely improper,
12        Mr. Schlesinger, and you know that.  This is
13        not --
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I wish I could agree,
15        Judge.
16              THE COURT:  This is not about sending a
17        message, ladies and gentlemen.  You will
18        disregard the comments from the attorney.
19              The motion for mistrial is under
20        advisement.
21              MR. FURR:  Thank you, sir.
22              MR. HEISE:  Thank you.
23              THE COURT:  Wrap up, please,
24        Mr. Schlesinger.
25              MR. SCHLESINGER:  If you see this evidence our way, and you decide that we're
2        right and it should be stitched -- stitched
3        together in the way that we said, and you get
4        to find that punitive damages are warranted, it
5        will allow you to express moral -- an
6        expression of moral condemnation for
7        intentional --
8              MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor, it's
9        the same -- it's the same argument.
10              THE COURT:  Finish your answer -- finish
11        your statement, sir.
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  It will allow you to
13        express moral condemnation, which is justly
14        deserved, for quasi-criminal acts.  And these
15        things lead to deterrence, and that is one of
16        the things that we want you to consider doing.
17        And I thank you for your time.


22           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Counsel, thank you.
23           Got 20 minutes in ya?  All right.
24           So very first thing I want to let you know.
25       The trial and the deliberation is yours.  When we turn this case over to you, we hand it to
2       you, it is yours to do as you please for the
3       period of time you feel necessary to go through
4       everything.  What I mean by that is, when I said
5       get us to Monday, it's because, again, the
6       conduct of the tobacco companies, which you may
7       have noticed, they didn't talk about what they
8       did, not one solitary word about it.  They
9       didn't talk about or discuss anything having to
10       do with all the years of the things they did to
11       deceive the public and cause deaths by addiction
12       of tens of millions of people with documents,
13       not one single document that they put in front
14       of you that shows something different than what
15       the truth is in their own internal secret
16       reports.
17           But when you get to deliberate, because
18       we're later in the afternoon than we meant to
19       be, and we always are, and it's Friday in the
20       afternoon the Judge is going to give you a lot
21       of leeway in deliberations.  And deliberations
22       can take days.  So you can deliberate Monday.
23       If you can't finish today you can come back.  It
24       will be at the Court's pleasure.  We'll be at
25       your pleasure to take the time you need to get through what you want to get through, because
2       you could get hung up on some of these
3       questions.  I think some of them do not need
4       that, but you just need to know you have as much
5       time as you want.  If we get to where we want to
6       be, which is where we hope the evidence takes
7       us, which is this warranting of punishment for
8       this long wrongful conduct then we have no
9       evidence to put on except for net worth of
10       companies.  And the only evidence they'll put
11       on is a single --
12           MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  Objection
13       as to the what the evidence will be.
14           MR. SCHLESINGER:  He talked about putting on
15       witnesses --
16           THE COURT:  Proceed.
17           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I think they have a single
18       witness named Dr. Figlar, who is a corporate rep
19       that will talk to you about other things going
20       on.  So you'll hear a brief witness from them
21       then you'll be able to go out and do punishment
22       damages.
23           The only reason I say it is that I just
24       don't want to think on Friday afternoon you're
25       like, let's just get out of here.  If the case warrants the full consideration the Court is
2       going to let you come back on Monday and
3       continue your deliberation.  It will still be
4       done in well under three weeks, which is what we
5       thought we were going to do.
6           Now, let's look real quickly at this
7       important instruction, because I want the
8       instructions to be clear.  And I don't know, can
9       you put it up, Baron?
10           MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, punishment
11       damages considerations, there's no doubt about
12       the doubt campaign.  I say there is no doubt.
13       That's why I'm proud and I embrace the standard
14       of clear and convincing evidence that you arrive
15       at without confusion, without doubt.  That is
16       the beautiful rebuttal to the doubt and the
17       confusion that decades of company
18       misrepresentations cause, the TIRC, the CTR that
19       they're telling you was a good organization are
20       co-conspirators under Engle and they have been
21       disbanded.  They are co-conspirators, those
22       front groups.
23           So it says here, "You may consider harms
24       suffered by other persons not parties to this
25       lawsuit in assessing the reprehensibility or wrongness of a defendant's act.
2           "You may consider harms by persons -- other
3       persons not parties to this lawsuit in assessing
4       reprehensibility wrongfulness of the defendants'
5       acts."
6           Why do you think we put in evidence of 20
7       million deaths?  And I tried to give you the
8       kind of language so you could understand what it
9       means.  I try to take you through a little walk
10       around Florida.  As a Florida native, I thought
11       we'd talk about Florida.  And imagine an empty
12       state.  That's how many people would have met
13       their demise.
14           But what's important, you also heard is,
15       that more than 40 million Americans are caught
16       in a web of tobacco dependence.  Remember you
17       heard that yesterday in cross-examination from
18       the current Surgeon General?  40 million people.
19       That's essentially all the smokers.
20           Nicotine dependence is 80 to 90 percent or
21       more of all smokers, and 80 to 90 percent of all
22       smokers begin in youth, adolescence, teens.  I'm
23       sorry we inadvertently would say words like
24       "kids" and "children."  We're not supposed to
25       say it.  That's not what we're talking about. That's what the judge's instruction was, but he
2       let us put in evidence.  I want to show Diane
3       Burrows -- of what they do and who they study,
4       replacement smokers.  All business is based on
5       youth.  And they have replacement smokers and
6       they have 12-year-olds.  And you know what a
7       12-year-old is to a tobacco company?  A young
8       adult.  A 12-year-old young adult.  That's what
9       they call them.  You see who they're seeing,
10       they're watching and marketing and studying, 12
11       year olds, 13 year olds, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, in
12       there, two-thirds of smokers are starting in
13       youth.
14           And my client George Banks was an age cohort
15       and Dr. DiFranza testified he probably started
16       in his teens because 90 percent of them do and
17       all -- according to this book, which is on
18       preventing tobacco use among youth and young
19       adults, all, all tobacco smoking begins in
20       adolescence.
21           MR. FURR:  Your Honor, objection.  That book
22       is not in evidence.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  An excerpt is, Judge.
24           THE COURT:  Don't show the book if it's not
25       in evidence, but you can comment and it will be up to the jury to determine --
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  There's an excerpt from
3       the book in evidence --
4           MR. FURR:  Your Honor, no excerpt from the
5       book in evidence.
6           THE COURT:  Again, the jury will be
7       cautioned to remember the testimony from the
8       witnesses.
9           If it's not in evidence don't show it.  You
10       can proceed.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  During cross of Dr. Hoge I
12       referred to the book.  One of the things they
13       talked about, the website, and it had links that
14       give you a link to the Surgeon General sites,
15       RJR showed their website.  That gave a link to
16       2008 and 2010.  They don't link to the 2012
17       report.  That's not linked.
18           And here is the Surgeon General's Report
19       that is in evidence, because we caught Mr. Furr
20       and he responded.  But the fact of the matter is
21       is he did something, and I submit to you the
22       evidence shows it was misleading.  This is the
23       official annual report of the Surgeon General of
24       the Public Health Service of the United States
25       for the fiscal year 1915.  And the man's name in here is Dr. Blue, it is not that long Symenanski
2       [sic] name, who was a surgeon, not a Surgeon
3       General.  This is the congressional official
4       report.
5           Dr. Proctor said that guy you're talking
6       about, I think he was a surgeon of some kind.
7       Look in this report.  It doesn't have a warning
8       about tobacco being addictive.  And it's
9       inconsistent.  In 1964 they said it was a habit.
10       What would have happened?  It doesn't appear in
11       here.  Tobacco is not a warning.  It was not
12       warned to be addictive in 1915.  You can look
13       through this.  This is in evidence.  And it is
14       not what they purport it to be.  It is not the
15       Surgeon General's Report, the document they
16       quoted from, not a Surgeon General's Report.
17       It's a report based on garment workers and it
18       didn't even have the quote correct the way he
19       said it had it.  He said there was a warning
20       that smoking is addictive.
21           Even the document he showed you didn't say
22       smoking was addictive.  It talked about tobacco
23       being the most popular form of tobacco
24       addiction, a colloquialism.  It was not, in my
25       assessment of the evidence, and hopefully yours, a completely candid way to show this to you.
2       But let me move on.
3           In this courtroom as we start, there is also
4       already an established baseline of the
5       defendants and their conduct.  They already have
6       been convicted of being conspirators,
7       fraudsters --
8           MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- liars.
10           MR. FURR:  It's absolutely an incorrect
11       statement of the law.
12           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, again, the
13       jury instructions dictate how you're guided in
14       this case.
15           Objection is overruled.  Go ahead.
16           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Right out of the box they
17       come into this courtroom having lied, having
18       deceived, having defrauded the American public,
19       and they don't ever want to talk about that at
20       all.  They just want to talk about Mr. Banks and
21       they want to quote from Roosevelt Hall.  What
22       were they doing going out to Roosevelt Hall's
23       house, more than one of them, two or more at a
24       time --
25           MR. FURR:  Objection. MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- unannounced four times.
2           MR. HEISE:  It's a pretrial ruling.
3           MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's in evidence.
4           THE COURT:  Sustained.
5           I take that back.  It's overruled.  It's
6       overruled.
7           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you, Judge.
8           "Did this individual who came here, what,
9       three or four times?
10           "Three or four times.
11           "How many times did the individual come to
12       your home?
13           "One time he came here with a man twice and
14       he came with a lady twice.
15           "So that's four times.
16           "Uh-huh.
17           "Did he ever call ahead of time to ask you
18       when a good time would be?
19           "He asked for my phone number, but he never
20       called because I never talked to him on the
21       phone.
22           "So on each of the four occasions the
23       investigators came to -- the tobacco companies
24       came to your home, they came unannounced.
25           "Yeah, unannounced." That's a neutral independent witness.  Did
2       you see any witness statements, recordings?  Do
3       you see the --
4           MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Did they put on the
6       witness stand the people that met with him?
7           MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
8           THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  And by the way, if a
10       person goes to work every day day in and day out
11       or goes through a Starbucks, how many folks or
12       acquaintances of ours that don't know anything
13       about our life, that don't know if we have kids
14       or don't know if we smoke or don't know if we
15       drink?  And Lampe, Hall and Hall never saw him
16       drink.  They said they saw him drunk.  Nobody
17       gave an amount of drinking.  Mrs. Hall didn't
18       live with him, was never up in his apartment.
19       They never got close enough to smell him.  And
20       they've taken people that don't know anything
21       about this man in particular.
22           And it was particularly inappropriate to
23       suggest that Mr. Lampe, who was a different
24       race, they didn't mix.  He said, We didn't mix.
25           MR. FURR:  Objection.  Excuse me, don't talk over the objection.
2           THE COURT:  Sir, don't make those comments.
3       It's improper.  The objection is sustained.
4           Continue, please.
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  There is evidence in the
6       case when they read from Mr. Lampe's deposition,
7       We were not social friends.  The man came to
8       work.  We didn't mix.  This is back a long time
9       ago.  What do you think they were talking about?
10           MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  They were not social
12       friends.
13           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, that is not
14       proper, sir.  I sustained the objection.
15       Disregard the remarks about mixing.
16           MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's in the case.
17           THE COURT:  I sustained the objection.
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.
19           Diedrich Lampe also said that despite what
20       he knew about being a mental paraplegic that he
21       knew there was confusion out there with regard
22       to what people knew about how dangerous health
23       [sic] was.
24           And here's what my client Mr. Banks was
25       faced with.  He was faced with a reality of a warning that said it might be dangerous to your
2       health and it is dangerous to your health but
3       didn't say specifically how it's dangerous.  He
4       didn't have details.  He didn't have
5       specificity.  And he had overwhelming
6       countermeasures in his face at all times from
7       tobacco trying to block anybody from really
8       coming to that conclusion.
9           And here's the thing, if everybody knew it
10       was dangerous, why didn't their clients know?
11       Why didn't they know?  Why didn't the tobacco
12       executives know?  Why didn't the scientists at
13       RJR know?  Why did they keep saying it's not
14       dangerous, it hasn't been proven, it's an open
15       question, here's a filter, it will work for you?
16       Why didn't they know?  Why is it everyone was
17       supposed to know in the '30s and '40s and '50s
18       and '60s but the tobacco industry executives
19       didn't know?  That's an interesting conundrum.
20       They knew.  You saw the documents.  Let's look
21       at some of them.
22           Let's look at -- let's look at this one, 49.
23       Please.
24           "As the lawyers remind us" -- this goes back
25       to 1980s.  "As the lawyers remind us, we can't defend continued smoking as free choice if the
2       person was addicted."
3           This is while they're still denying
4       addiction.  All the way through the Engle trial
5       in 1999, denying addiction, not admitted until
6       the year 2000.  "We can't defend continued
7       smoking as free choice if the person was
8       addicted."
9           Because they knew that they had to deny
10       addiction.  They knew they had to continue to
11       deceive the public.  And they did.  And they
12       admit it internally.  We got no defense if it
13       turns out this is an addictive substance.  And
14       there it is in their own words.
15           Next.  Let's do 51, please.
16           This is Claude Teague.  Remember I said we'd
17       shine a spotlight on Claude Teague.  I've got
18       another board for him to do that.
19           But, look, I call this document the chiller
20       because when I read it I see how cold-blooded --
21           MR. FURR:  Objection.
22           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  You said that was
24       appropriate closing argument.
25           MR. HEISE:  We move, Your Honor. MR. SCHLESINGER:  I have a ruling from you.
2       You said it may be appropriate in closing
3       argument.
4           THE COURT:  Objection is sustained.  You may
5       continue, sir.
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I apologize.
7           MR. FURR:  Could you rule.
8           THE COURT:  Your motion is under advisement.
9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I don't have to
10       characterize this statement, and I'm sorry if I
11       did, but I don't have to characterize it.  I'm
12       just going to read the language and you can
13       decide yourself what it means and if it's
14       inhuman and indecent.
15           MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor, same
16       issue.
17           THE COURT:  Overruled.
18           Continue, sir.
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Because you are allowed to
20       consider the wrongfulness to others as to the
21       degree of reprehensibility, that's what this
22       case is about.
23           "We have deliberately played down the role
24       of nicotine; hence, the nonsmoker has little or
25       no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him and no desire to try.  Instead we must
2       somehow convince him with wholly irrational
3       reasons that he should try smoking in the hope
4       that he will for himself then discover the real
5       'satisfactions,'" in quotes, "obtainable."
6           And we know they use code words and we know
7       satisfaction is a code word for intent.  And
8       that is the deliberate, intentional knowledge
9       aforethought business of addicting youth into a
10       lifetime of smoking and then replacing the dying
11       smokers with new smokers.
12           Let's go to the other board.
13           These are just some of the things Claude
14       Teague, more than anybody else you can shine a
15       spotlight on this man who spent a lifetime, an
16       illustrious career at RJ Reynolds doing nothing
17       but things which are not appropriate for decent
18       humans who follow a moral compass.
19           He knew that if your company is to survive
20       and prosper over the long term you must get your
21       share of the youth market.
22           Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine
23       is habituating and unique in its physiological
24       action.
25           Nicotine is the sine quinon of smoking. And they know how to induce a pre-smoker --
2       right, the 12-year-old young adult -- induce a
3       pre-smoker or a nonsmoker to become a habituated
4       or a hooked smoker.
5           They want to hook them.  Nobody chooses
6       addiction.  They don't know what they're getting
7       themselves into.  By the time they hear
8       something about it being dangerous it may be
9       harmful for your health.  Mr. Banks is hooked
10       for decades.  The man is hooked for decades.
11           It goes on, this is all Teague.
12           Nicotine, a potent drug.
13           Our industry is based upon the design, sale
14       and manufacture of attractive doses of nicotine.
15           And then Teague is involved in the
16       suppression research.
17           I destroyed all the formal reports.  And we
18       have tons of documents in evidence suppression
19       and burying reports.
20           Then he goes on to talk about getting the
21       nicotine kick with the ammonia compounds to
22       release the full potential of this powerfully
23       addictive drug.  And he indicates how you can
24       instantly perceive the nicotine kick with the
25       ammonia compounds, the soul of the Marlboro cigarette.
2           Down here he says, We can't be comfortable
3       selling a product which most of our customers
4       would stop using if they could, that is to say,
5       if the exit gate from our market should suddenly
6       open we could be out of business overnight.
7           Now what is the discomfort?  The discomfort
8       is that if somebody -- let's put up this one.
9       The discomfort is if we have a business and if
10       there's a way for someone to figure out how to
11       get our hooked patients, our consumers not
12       hooked, we could be out of business overnight.
13       And what are they uncomfortable with?  Are they
14       uncomfortable with the cigarette being used as
15       intended and killing half their customers?  No.
16       Are they uncomfortable with addicting them to
17       the point where they smoke millions of hits of
18       nicotine and poisons for decades and die?  No.
19       They're uncomfortable with losing their
20       business.
21           What is a moral compass?  What does an
22       ethical person do in a situation like that?
23       They are uncomfortable with the fact that their
24       product is killing somebody.  That's what you're
25       supposed to be uncomfortable with, not uncomfortable with the prospect that something
2       could happen and you could be out of business
3       overnight.  That is a rutterless ship on a moral
4       sea, rutterless ship.
5           And here is something that is also important
6       to look at.  This is when they were first
7       starting to develop ways to put drugs that might
8       block nicotine.  Like I said, why does it have
9       to be so hard?  If the cigarettes aren't
10       addictive, if you don't have cigarettes, if you
11       stop making them like you promised, why do we
12       have to go through this unbelievable contortion
13       in this country for people to get off
14       cigarettes?  Why does it have to be so hard?
15       Why?  Because it's so addictive.  Why else?
16       They don't want people to quit because people
17       that quit quit buying.  Quit smoking means quit
18       buying.  They don't want people to quit.  And
19       they don't care if they die.  And when they die
20       they replace them, with youth.  I mean, really.
21           MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I object.
22           THE COURT:  One minute, Mr. Schlesinger.
23           MR. FURR:  Inflammatory and prejudicial.
24           THE COURT:  Overruled.
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  If you look at this it says, if we go forward with this research to
2       block nicotine, we are going to be in the
3       process of digging our own graves.  And we're
4       not going to do it because it could put the
5       tobacco manufacturers out of business.
6           And let's put this up real quick, because I
7       saw this and I said, there's just no way.  I
8       brought awesome, excellent, highly qualified
9       experts.  They brought nobody.  I brought
10       Dr. Traube.  They didn't touch Dr. Traube on
11       cross.  He said in no uncertain terms the man
12       was addicted, he got esophageal cancer
13       principally from smoking.  He candidly, like a
14       scientist, acknowledged that alcohol played a
15       role.  And then Mr. Furr got up here and put up
16       a slide.  The slide had no reference to the page
17       and line.  And when I pulled it it said, if he
18       quit smoking, if he quit drinking --
19           MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I object.  This is
20       wrong.
21           MR. SCHLESINGER:  That quote is not in this
22       record.
23           THE COURT:  Mr. Schlesinger, when there's an
24       objection please stop.
25           Your objection is overruled. You may continue, sir.  You need to wrap up.
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Just like the business
3       about he died alone, just like the business of
4       the record saying you better get back here.
5       There is no record that says you better get back
6       here.  These are the things they do.  This is
7       the evidence and you can consider --
8           MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor --
9           MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.  He's
10       again just disparaging the defense.
11           THE COURT:  The motion is under advisement.
12       The objection is sustained.
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  You can consider whether
14       or not this is incomplete reference to the
15       evidence in a way that could confuse you or
16       cause doubt or make you uncertain.  But this is
17       what it says.
18           "If he had quit smoking -- excuse me -- if
19       he had quit drinking when he quit smoking in
20       1988 he would have cut his risk for esophageal
21       cancer by 50 percent more likely than not."
22           Highly qualified expert, he gave excellent
23       explanation as to what happened.
24           Dr. DiFranza also said he died from
25       esophageal cancer from smoking and that he was definitely addicted.  And Dr. Traube said he was
2       definitely addicted.  They didn't bring anybody
3       except for Dr. Hoge, who even admitted that the
4       nicotine contributed to his smoking [sic].  And
5       Dr. Hoge, like I said, you've got the power to
6       reject his opinions and take him out of this
7       courtroom.
8           One more.  Let me just see here.
9           Oh, this I have to touch base on.  This I
10       have to touch base on.
11           Okay.  Here's something contemporaneous.
12       Put it up.  I saved this.
13           I wanted to prove the case to you by the
14       medical records.  They definitively with virtual
15       certainty document the most important witness in
16       the case, Mr. George Banks, who for no reason
17       other than he was asked by a doctor when he had
18       a broken hand.  Which by the way when his hand
19       was broken he couldn't write a not, so a friend
20       wrote a note expressing love to his daughter.
21       Like that's some sort of mystery or maybe an
22       insinuation that there was an affair.  There's
23       nothing like that in this case, nothing like
24       that in this case.  But most importantly, most
25       importantly, and I saved it and I wanted to show it to you and I wanted to bring it out, because
2       I wanted to prove my case with experts who have
3       been world renowned and sought by the Surgeon
4       General and people all over the world.  And I
5       did it with Dr. DiFranza and Cummings and Traube
6       and Proctor.  Proctor, a hero who -- his book is
7       a revelation what he's revealed about the secret
8       wrongdoing of the tobacco industry for decades,
9       something we cannot accept in this country as a
10       proper corporate activity.
11           But here is a document, this is a
12       contemporaneous medical record.  And Mr. Furr
13       said Yvonne said give me a letter that says
14       smoking made him die.  Where's the evidence of
15       that in this case?  There's no such testimony.
16           Let's look at the letter.  The letter says,
17       "Dear Mrs. Banks:  This is in response to your
18       inquiry about the cause of your husband's death
19       while hospitalized at Lake City Virginia [sic]
20       VA Medical Center between the 29th and the
21       15th." [sic]
22           Right down here, "The cause of lung cancer
23       and emphysema is most likely related to
24       smoking."
25           And he had had the autopsy report.  He knew the cause of his death was cancer of the lung
2       and esophagus food pipe.  He knew the esophagus
3       food pipe cancer had spread to the lung.
4           Read the autopsy report.  You'll see it in
5       there.  By the time it spreads and it's fatal in
6       your lung when you can't breathe and the fluid
7       is building up, you die from that spread of
8       cancer.  He explains it.  This is a totally
9       independent witness.  They didn't bring him.
10       They didn't depose him.  They brought no expert
11       to contradict --
12           MR. HEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
13           THE COURT:  Overruled.
14           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- him.  And this is a
15       very simple medical record, contemporaneous
16       within a few weeks of his death, within days or
17       a month after the autopsy was completed and
18       reviewed by the treating doctor that was there
19       with him in February of '96 at his bedside who
20       was asked by a family that was surprised by
21       weight loss, which in two or three months was
22       dramatic.  And it wasn't 50 pounds.  Look at the
23       record.  It was about 40 pounds.  Because
24       there's other weights in there of 122 pounds.
25       He went from 160 to 122.  It said in the record, 40-pound weight loss in the last several months.
2       It's in the record, look at the record.
3           And it says right here, "The cause of lung
4       cancer and emphysema most likely related to
5       cigarette smoking."  Treating doctor, totally
6       independent.  Dr. Siri.  A medical record in the
7       case documenting that the man died from
8       cigarette smoking.
9           And back at the time in 1988 and 1990 when
10       he was in the hospital -- in 1990 he had quit
11       smoking.  Why would a doctor write down in the
12       chart, you have a smoking addiction?  He said he
13       quit smoking two years earlier.  Mr. Furr said,
14       nobody wrote down that he was an addicted
15       smoker.  First of all, nobody writes that down,
16       you don't see that in medical records.  Just
17       like I showed you the new autopsy report.  The
18       new autopsy report talks about whether smoking
19       contributed to disease.  That's the modern way,
20       but back then it's not common for someone to
21       write that down.  And what's more, why would you
22       write down that a man has an ongoing tobacco
23       addiction if in 1990 when he is there for a
24       broken hand he says, I stopped smoking two years
25       ago, but I smoked for 50 years before that. There would be no medical need at that point to
2       document him as an addicted smoker.
3           But here is a totally independent, not a
4       witness that anybody hired in the case, a
5       treating doctor at the time, contemporaneous.
6       Dr. Hoge said contemporaneous records are so
7       valid.  The man died from smoking.
8           THE COURT:  You're at the end of your time,
9       sir, you need to wrap up.
10           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I told you first I said I
11       don't know how much to ask for and I said maybe
12       a million a piece would be appropriate, but,
13       again, the six of you can make the decision.
14       That's why I said you can give as many as 2 and
15       a half, 2 -- I said 2 million or 3 million a
16       piece.  You can give 500,000 a piece.  You can
17       give any amount you want.
18           Your life experience and my life experience
19       can differ and so when I make a recommendation,
20       it's just to give you someplace to work.  And
21       you can decide based on what you think the
22       strengths and weaknesses of the relationship
23       were what is fair.
24           But, quite honestly, if you watch Katrina
25       testify and she always consistently said the man smoked Marlboros, by the way.  If you watched
2       her testify and you saw what you thought is the
3       ring of truth, an honest, appropriate, emotional
4       responses at honest moments in time.  That's why
5       we have a trial here in a courtroom live as
6       opposed to just something that you read about or
7       hear about.  When you see folks live you get a
8       chance to see how they really are.
9           Look, you've given us attention over and
10       above and beyond the call of duty.  I always say
11       I wish my jurors the best of luck at arriving at
12       justice.  What we look for is justice.  The
13       system gives us a chance at justice.  We have a
14       fervent prayer that we get to justice.  And I
15       say to you, you hold in your hands this
16       decision.  It is a wonderful opportunity to
17       continue this jury system.  You hold great power
18       and please discharge it wisely.  And we will all
19       be thankful for that no matter what decision you
20       make.
21           Thank you.
