 9                MR. GERAGHTY:  Good morning, ladies and
10          gentlemen.  This is my last opportunity to
11          speak with you, and the last chance I have to
12          thank you for your time and service in this
13          case.
14                As Mr. Hammer said, we've spent a lot of
15          time together over the last two-and-a-half
16          weeks, you've all worked extremely hard, and on
17          behalf of Philip Morris, Jenny Brown and
18          myself, I want to thank you for your time and
19          attention in this case.
20                You know, Mr. Hammer, not surprisingly,
21          spent a lot of time talking about Philip Morris
22          earlier today.  Let me be very clear.  There
23          are things in some of those documents, said by
24          employees of Philip Morris that reflect
25          thoughts that you and I would never have, never

 1          have.
 2                MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
 3                THE COURT:  Overruled.
 4                MR. GERAGHTY:  If the issue were whether
 5          the things that Philip Morris said or did, the
 6          things that Philip Morris said or did over
 7          time, that you and I would consider to be  8          inappropriate --
 9                MR. HAMMER:  Judge --
10                MR. GERAGHTY:  -- if that were the
11          issue --
12                MR. HAMMER:  -- objection to the --
13                THE COURT:  Yeah, stop personalizing it
14          with the jury, sir.
15                MR. GERAGHTY:  If there were things that
16          were inappropriate, if that was the question,
17          whether some of the things you saw or heard
18          were inappropriate, I would sit down right now
19          and I wouldn't say another word.  That's not
20          the issue or the issues that you're being asked
21          to decide in this case.
22                Before I show you the verdict form and we
23          talk about that issue, I want to talk about two
24          undeniable facts that have been established by
25          the evidence you've seen over the last

 1          two-and-a-half weeks.
 2                The first one is the one Mr. Hammer told
 3          you that in his opening statement, and you're
 4          going to get an instruction about it, but Leon
 5          Barbanell admits that Shirley is responsible
 6          for her own death.  That's a fact established
 7          by the evidence and the admission made by the
 8          plaintiff in this case.
 9                MR. HAMMER:  Judge, I've got to object to
10          that statement.  That's an improper statement,
11          it was not how it was characterized.
12                THE COURT:  Correct.  That is incorrect.
13                MR. HAMMER:  I would ask for an
14          instruction to the jury.
15                THE COURT:  I just did.
16                MR. GERAGHTY:  The second fact that has
17          been established by the --
18                MR. HAMMER:  Excuse me.  Can we have that
19          taken down, Judge?  That was sustained.
20                THE COURT:  Yes.
21                MR. GERAGHTY:  The second fact is nothing
22          Philip Morris said or did or failed to say or
23          do influenced Shirley Barbanell's decision to
24          smoke cigarettes.  That's the evidence you've
25          heard over the last two-and-a-half weeks.

 1          You've heard that from Mr. Barbanell very
 2          candidly, you've heard that from Shirley's
 3          daughter, Karen Siegel.
 4                Let me go, then, to the verdict form.
 5          And you're going to see, Mr. Hammer showed you
 6          there are several questions you're going to be
 7          asked to address.
 8                Was the negligence on the part of Philip
 9          Morris USA, a legal cause of Shirley
10          Barbanell's death?  That's Question Number 1.
11                Were the defective cigarettes by reason
12          of their design, which were manufactured by
13          Philip Morris USA, a legal cause of Shirley
14          Barbanell's death?
15                The third question:  Were the cigarettes
16          manufactured by Philip Morris USA, which are
17          defective due to being unfit for the uses
18          intended or reasonably foreseeable, a legal 19          cause of Shirley Barbanell's death?
20                Keep in mind that on these three
21          questions, and, frankly, all the issues you're
22          going to be asked to decide in this phase of
23          the case, the burden of proof is on the
24          plaintiff to prove each of these to you by the
25          greater weight of the evidence.

 1                Now, I want to talk about these first
 2          three questions.  They all relate to the
 3          question of causation and legal cause.
 4                And you now understand what legal cause
 5          means because you addressed legal cause as part
 6          of the issue in Phase 1, but you'll get an
 7          instruction from Judge Streitfeld about that.
 8                Your job today in Phase 2 is to determine
 9          whether the conduct of Philip Morris, not just
10          its cigarettes, not just the fact that they
11          manufactured cigarettes and Shirley Barbanell
12          smoked cigarettes, but whether the conduct of
13          Philip Morris you've heard about during this
14          trial, or in the findings that have been
15          provided to you by the Court, whether that
16          conduct was the legal cause of Shirley
17          Barbanell's death.
18                MR. HAMMER:  Actually, Judge, objection.
19          That's actually not the instruction.
20                THE COURT:  That's some of the issues, it
21          is, sir; but I am cautioning counsel to be
22          careful as to what you tell the jury, because
23          that's the second time where what you've said
24          is not exactly accurate.
25                The first being the -- what was admitted.

 1          It wasn't sole responsibility, it was partial
 2          responsibility; and you know that because we've
 3          gone over my instructions.  Please be careful
 4          what you argue to this jury.
 5                Continue.
 6                MR. GERAGHTY:  Mr. Hammer tried to
 7          suggest to you that you should answer "yes" to
 8          these three questions based solely on the
 9          findings that you were told about by Judge
10          Streitfeld yesterday and which he will instruct
11          you again later today.  That's simply not the
12          case, because, as you know, you've seen those
13          findings, those findings don't relate
14          specifically to Shirley Barbanell.
15                And why would we be having this trial in
16          Phase 2 if the issue had already been resolved?
17                MR. HAMMER:  Judge, I'm sorry, I have to
18          object.  Can we take the jury out, please?
19                THE COURT:  No.
20                Ladies and gentleman, there are certain
21          findings that are binding upon you, and I've
22          instructed you about that, and I'll instruct
23          you again.  There are certain issues that are
24          not specifically addressed; but I am cautioning
25          you, Counsel, to be careful with the broad

 1          brush you're painting, it is misleading.
 2                MR. GERAGHTY:  Let me give you an
 3          example.  The Court has already instructed you  4          that Philip Morris USA was negligent.  That's
 5          one of the findings you were told about
 6          yesterday, and that's one of the findings that
 7          Judge Streitfeld is going to tell you about
 8          again later today.
 9                The question on Number 1, for example,
10          is, was the negligence -- was the negligence a
11          legal cause of Shirley Barbanell's death.
12          That's exactly what the question asks you to
13          decide.  Was the negligence a legal cause of
14          Shirley Barbanell's death.
15                These questions require the plaintiffs to
16          prove something different than whether Shirley
17          Barbanell's addiction to cigarettes containing
18          nicotine was the legal cause of her loss.  That
19          was the question you already answered in Phase
20          1.  That was the question you already answered
21          in Phase 1.
22                Your job today is different.  Your job in
23          this phase is to determine whether the findings
24          or the conduct you've heard about in this trial
25          was the legal cause of Shirley Barbanell's

 1          death.  And it's the same analysis you need to
 2          go through when you retire to deliberate as to
 3          all three of these causation questions.
 4                Now, the next issue you will have to
 5          decide is what is called comparative fault.
 6          It's Question Number 4 on the verdict form.
 7                And that question simply asks you to
 8          weigh and determine what percentage of fault do
 9          you assign to Philip Morris and what percentage
10          of fault do you assign to Shirley Barbanell.
11          It's a weighing that you need to engage in when
12          you go back to the jury room and deliberate.
13                And then, finally, on the second page is
14          a question that asks you about damages.  What
15          is the total amount of any damages sustained by
16          Leon Barbanell.
17                Now, the way the verdict form is set up,
18          you will have to answer all five questions
19          irrespective of how you answer any of the first
20          four.
21                Now, Mr. Hammer spent most of his time
22          talking about Philip Morris, about Philip
23          Morris documents, and Philip Morris statements.
24          He talked to you about advertisements.  He
25          talked to you about the Tobacco Industry

 1          Research Committee called TIRC, which was later
 2          renamed the Council for Tobacco Research, or
 3          CTR.  He talked to you about the Tobacco
 4          Institute.
 5                And what he told you was these were all
 6          organizations used by Philip Morris to deny the
 7          health hazards of cigarette smoking.  That's
 8          what he told you during his presentation.
 9                But the question you need to ask, the
10          important issue here, is, what does any of that
11          have to do with Shirley Barbanell?  What impact
12          did that have on Shirley Barbanell?
13                And you've heard the evidence on that
14          issue from, basically, two people.  You've 15          heard it from Leon Barbanell, and you've heard
16          it from Karen -- from Shirley's daughter, Karen
17          Siegel.
18                And the answer is, absolutely nothing
19          that Philip Morris said, or didn't say, or did
20          or didn't do played any role in Shirley
21          Barbanell's decisions to smoke.
22                Michael, if we could play that first
23          clip.  This is the testimony from Leon
24          Barbanell that you saw yesterday by videotape.
25             (Whereupon, the portions of the videotape

 1          deposition of Leon Barbanell were was played to
 2          the jury as follows:)
 3              Mr. Barbanell, have you ever heard of the
 4          Tobacco Industry Research Committee?
 5              Did I ever hear of it?
 6              It doesn't ring a bell?
 7              No, it doesn't.  I can't swear either way
 8          that I heard it.
 9              And is it accurate to say that you and
10          Shirley never heard anything from the --
11              From that --
12              -- from that entity?
13              Right.
14              Never did?
15              No.
16             Did you ever hear or read anything from the
17          Council for Tobacco Research?
18              No.
19              And, to your knowledge, did Shirley ever
20          hear or read anything --
21              No.
22              -- from the Council for Tobacco Research?
23              No, no.  That's a no.
24              And --
25              I said it's a no.

 1              And is it accurate to say you've never
 2          heard or read or seen anything from the Tobacco
 3          Institute?
 4             No, I haven't.
 5             And is it also accurate to say that Shirley
 6          never read or heard --
 7             You're right.
 8              -- never heard or read anything from the
 9          tobacco --
10              Right, never heard anything from them.
11              Okay.  Have you ever heard of the "Frank
12          Statement to Cigarette Smokers"?
13              What statement, Frank?
14              The "Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers,"
15          have you ever heard of that?
16              No, I never heard of that.
17              Never talked to Shirley about that, did
18          you?
19              I don't even know what it is.
20              It's kind of hard to talk about it, then.
21              That's right.
22              And did you ever hear Shirley mention the
23          "Frank Statement"?
24              No, I never heard of that one.
25              And then, finally, Philip Morris USA, 3188
 1          you've heard of them; right?
 2              Right, sure.
 3              Have you heard, read or seen any statements
 4          from Philip Morris USA?
 5                 No, no statements.
 6                 To your knowledge, did Shirley ever
 7          receive any written materials in the mail
 8          directly from a tobacco company?
 9                 Never.
10                 Did Shirley ever specifically tell you
11          that a tobacco company withheld information
12          from her?
13                Ever tell me, no.
14                MR. GERAGHTY:  That was Mr. Barbanell's
15          testimony.  He was very candid, and he was
16          unequivocal about it.  He and Shirley never
17          heard of the TIRC, they never heard of the CTR,
18          they never heard of the Tobacco Institute, they
19          never heard anything from any of those
20          organizations.  Neither one of them had ever
21          heard of the "Frank Statement," which
22          Mr. Hammer talked about for quite some time.
23                They never heard anything from Philip
24          Morris.  Nothing was concealed from Shirley.
25          Leon, Mr. Barbanell, told you that quite

 1          candidly in his testimony.
 2                Karen Siegel testified the same way.  You
 3          didn't get a chance to see Karen, but here is
 4          her testimony.  Karen Siegel's testimony:
 5                Did your mom ever tell you she heard any
 6          tobacco company's statements?
 7                Answer:  We did not talk about it.
 8                Question:  Did your mother ever tell you
 9          that any tobacco company withheld information
10          from her?
11                No.
12                The testimony from the two people who
13          knew Shirley Barbanell the best during her
14          life, it's unequivocal, there's absolutely no
15          evidence.
16                When you go back to deliberate, think
17          about the evidence that has been presented to
18          you in this phase of the case.  In this phase
19          of the case.
20                Mr. Barbanell testified, he talked about
21          his loss of Shirley.  You heard from Faye
22          Barbanell.  Faye also talked about Leon's loss.
23          But you didn't hear any testimony from Leon
24          that Philip Morris' conduct or statements had
25          anything to do with Shirley's decisions, her

 1          choices to smoke.
 2                The bottom line is, that in the
 3          two-and-a-half weeks you've been here, the
 4          plaintiff has not presented one piece of
 5          evidence, not one piece of evidence that allows
 6          you to find that anything that Philip Morris
 7          did or failed to do contributed substantially
 8          to Shirley Barbanell's death, other than the
 9          fact that they manufacture cigarettes, and that
10          Shirley chose to smoke that particular brand. 11          And that is not legal cause.
12                In fact, the only new evidence you heard
13          in this phase of the trial, and that you're
14          going to get an instruction from, from the
15          Judge, is regarding this admission that Shirley
16          shares responsibility for her own death.
17                Let's talk about what that admission
18          means.  You'll remember two weeks ago on
19          Monday, Mr. Hammer stood up, the very first
20          thing you heard from any of us during his
21          opening statement in Phase 1, and he told you
22          that Shirley made poor choices, poor choices to
23          smoke, to continue smoking and not to quit.
24                Those were Mr. Hammer's words, not mine.
25          He told you in his opening statement that Leon

 1          said Shirley shared fault for what happened to
 2          her.
 3                Now, I need to say one more time, one
 4          more time that I'm not trying to be critical of
 5          Shirley Barbanell, because she chose to smoke,
 6          and because ultimately she chose never to quit.
 7                In this country, we value freedom,
 8          self-determination and personal responsibility
 9          above all else.
10                During the voir dire process, Judge
11          Streitfeld told you that our democratic
12          principles of government, our justice system,
13          those are designed to protect those freedoms,
14          and to protect those rights.
15                It's that freedom, that freedom that we
16          have in this country, that makes the United
17          States the envy of many countries around the
18          world.
19                And it's that same freedom that makes
20          cigarettes a legal product, despite the fact
21          there are -- that there are well-known health
22          risks, because in this country, we believe that
23          people have the right to choose, they have the
24          right to make choices for themselves even when
25          those choices carry serious health risks.

 1                You may recall that you saw a clip from
 2          the See it Now program.  There was a Dr. E.
 3          Cuyler Hammond, he was a doctor with the
 4          American Cancer Society, and he talked about
 5          this principle as it relates to cigarettes more
 6          than 50 years ago in 1955, on that See it Now
 7          program.
 8                Michael, could we play that clip, please?
 9               (Thereupon, the videoclip was played and
10          taken down to the best of the reporter's
11          ability as follows:)
12               In my opinion, people should be warned of
13          the dangers, and they are being warned.  What
14          they then want to do, whether they wish to
15          smoke or not, is their own business.
16                MR. GERAGHTY:  That was the head of the
17          American Cancer Society, who was fervently
18          anti-smoking, saying the same thing I just told
19          you more than 50 years ago.
20                But with that freedom comes the
21          obligation on the part of the individual to 22          take personal responsibility for whatever might
23          befall them.
24                And Leon Barbanell knows this, and that's
25          why he and his lawyers admitted that his wife

 1          shares fault, that she shares responsibility.
 2                And you recall Leon actually testified
 3          briefly about this during Phase 1.  This is
 4          Leon's testimony:
 5                You would agree, would you not,
 6          Mr. Barbanell, that even though your wife told
 7          you she was addicted to cigarette smoking, that
 8          she could have quit smoking if she had really
 9          tried?
10                And the answer he gave was, I don't know
11          about that, if she could or not, she didn't
12          try, so I couldn't really tell you.  Not then,
13          anyway.
14                And because of the admission that he and
15          his attorneys made, you're going to receive an
16          instruction from the Court, and it says:  I
17          instruct you that the plaintiff has admitted
18          that Shirley Barbanell shares some
19          responsibility for her death based on the
20          frequency and duration of her quit attempts.
21                That's the precise instruction you're
22          going to receive from the Court at the
23          conclusion of these arguments.
24                Now, I want you to focus on that
25          language, "she shares some responsibility for

 1          her death based on the frequency and duration
 2          of her quit attempts."
 3                What that means is that Leon Barbanell
 4          admits that Shirley should have tried to quit
 5          more often; and when she did, she should have
 6          tried harder to quit.  Harder to quit.
 7                It means that Mr. Barbanell acknowledges
 8          that Shirley contributed substantially to her
 9          own death.  It means that but for Shirley
10          Barbanell's failure to quit smoking, she would
11          not have died from lung cancer.  That's what
12          that admission means.
13                MR. HAMMER:  Judge, objection.  That is
14          not the law.  That's not what you're going
15          to --
16                THE COURT:  Sustained.
17                MR. GERAGHTY:  What does this admission
18          mean?  There are three key points.  It means
19          that Shirley was well aware -- Plaintiff
20          Barbanell is acknowledging to you that Shirley
21          was well aware of the health risks of smoking.
22          Enough to know that she could quit, enough to
23          know that she should have quit.
24                Shirley could have quit smoking in time
25          to avoid her injury.  That's what it means when

 1          you say that you're responsible.  She could
 2          have quit in time to avoid her injury.
 3                And, third, it's an acknowledgment that
 4          Philip Morris' conduct had nothing to do with
 5          her decisions, her choices to smoke, to
 6          continue smoking, and not to quit.  7                Keep in mind that Mr. Hammer told you
 8          they made this admission when this lawsuit was
 9          first filed.  They made this admission when
10          they knew everything about Philip Morris'
11          conduct, everything about Philip Morris'
12          statements, everything that you've heard during
13          this trial.  They were well aware of the
14          findings from the previous case, they knew
15          about those, too.
16                They knew that they would be asking you
17          one day, a jury, to determine that Philip
18          Morris' negligence was a legal cause of Shirley
19          Barbanell's death.
20                And knowing all that, knowing all that,
21          they made the decision, and Leon has
22          acknowledged, that Shirley Barbanell shares
23          responsibility.
24                Now, don't let Mr. Hammer or the
25          plaintiff focus you away from this admission by

 1          talking about addiction.  There is no mention
 2          of "addiction" in the instructions you're going
 3          to receive from Judge Streitfeld on this issue;
 4          and you have already decided the role that
 5          addiction has played.  You decided that in
 6          Phase 1.  And we are now in Phase 2.
 7                Nor do the findings change what you've
 8          heard about plaintiff's admission.  The
 9          admission means Mrs. Barbanell had the
10          knowledge she needed to stop smoking, but she
11          chose not to.  She chose not to.
12                The evidence demonstrates that
13          Mrs. Barbanell knew by the 1950's that smoking
14          was bad for her health.
15                What is the evidence you've heard?
16          You've heard that her sister-in-law, Faye
17          Barbanell, told her that in the 50's.  You
18          heard that Karen Siegel, her daughter, was
19          telling her that from the time she was a young
20          girl.
21                Did Shirley understand what these people
22          were telling her?  You've already heard the
23          evidence.  You know the answer to that
24          question.  But let's go through the testimony.
25                Karen Siegel testified from the time I

 1          was in high school, and past high school, she
 2          was very, very aware that her smoking was
 3          causing serious problems to her health.  From
 4          my high school years on.  That's Karen.
 5                What else did Karen tell you?  She said
 6          "she," referring to her mother, Shirley, knew
 7          that smoking was causing her health to be in a
 8          very -- to be -- for her to be -- to have such
 9          bad health.  She knew that.  She told me that
10          many, many times.  I heard it again and again
11          and again and again.  I heard it from the time
12          I was very, very young, she was aware that
13          smoking was making her sick, she knew it.
14                This is Karen telling you what her mother
15          knew when Karen was a young girl.  When Karen
16          was a young girl.
17                You heard similar testimony from Leon 18          Barbanell.  You heard similar testimony from
19          Leon Barbanell.  He told you that he was
20          bugging Shirley to quit between 1965 and 1970.
21                Can we play that clip, please, Michael?
22              (Thereupon, the following portions of the
23          video deposition of Leon Barbanell, was played
24          and taken down to the best of the reporter's
25          ability as follows:)

 1                Why were you bugging her about it?
 2                Because she was smoking too much.  It's a
 3          lot of cigarettes, two packs a day.
 4                Well, what's wrong with that?
 5                It's a lot of smoking.  I didn't smoke
 6          two packs a day when I was smoking cigarettes.
 7                But why -- why is that a big deal,
 8          smoking two packs a day?
 9                Why is it a big deal?
10                Yes, sir.
11                Because, to me, it's a lot of cigarettes
12          you're smoking, that's it.
13                And it's bad for you; right?
14                I didn't know it was bad then, when she
15          started; but when -- when you see the reports,
16          and when she was starting to get the shortness
17          of breath, I said, hey, you know, maybe you're
18          smoking -- you need to cut it down a little
19          bit.
20                And we're talking about 1965 to 1970 here
21          when you were bugging her --
22                Yeah.
23                -- about her smoking?
24                You were bugging her because you knew it
25          wasn't good for her; right?

 1                I didn't know it wasn't good for her, I
 2          was -- I thought it might not be good for her,
 3          because when she started getting a little short
 4          of breath and all, I said, maybe -- you know,
 5          maybe you're smoking too much.  That's it.
 6                MR. GERAGHTY:  That was Mr. Barbanell.
 7          That was Mr. Barbanell.  Shirley's knowledge
 8          about the health hazards of smoking made the
 9          release of the 1964 Surgeon General's report,
10          Mr. Barbanell told you this, a nonevent.  It
11          was information they already knew.
12                And you saw examples from Dr. Hoff, you
13          saw examples that Dr. Hoff showed you in her
14          testimony.  She showed you lots of examples of
15          information about the health risks of smoking
16          that were being publicized in this country in
17          the 40's, before 1940, the 40's, the 50's and
18          the 60's.
19                And we know this information made its way
20          to Shirley and Leon.  And how do we know that?
21          Because Leon told you -- remember his
22          testimony -- Leon told you that when he started
23          smoking at the age of 17, in 1935, that he had
24          heard of the term "coffin nail," and he
25          understood what that meant.  Mr. Barbanell told

 1          you that.  Remember his testimony.
 2                Question:  Do you remember when you were  3          a teenager hearing other friends of yours who
 4          were smokers refer to cigarettes as coffin
 5          nails?
 6                Answer:  Yeah, they're kidding around.
 7          They would say, hey, you're smoking coffin
 8          nails, that's it.
 9                Question:  It means that -- that if you
10          smoke enough cigarettes, you're going to be
11          dead?
12                Answer:  That's right.
13                Question:  And you knew that when you
14          were 17?
15                Answer:  That's right.  That.
16                Was Mr. Barbanell's testimony.  That was
17          his testimony.  You also heard that Shirley
18          knew that cigarettes were addictive, she
19          believed cigarettes were addictive, and she
20          specifically told her husband, Leon, that she
21          was addicted to cigarettes in the 50's before
22          they were ever married.
23                This is Mr. Barbanell's testimony.  This
24          is his testimony:
25                Question:  And she referred to herself as

 1          addicted in conversations with you as long ago
 2          as the late 1950's; right?
 3                Right.
 4                Question:  Before the two of you were
 5          ever married?
 6                Answer:  Right.
 7                Mr. Hammer wants you to believe that this
 8          was a secret known only to Philip Morris, known
 9          only to Philip Morris.  Shirley knew about it
10          in the 50's.
11                You heard from Dr. Benowitz.  He told you
12          people knew about these things for many, many
13          years.  The plaintiff's own expert on nicotine
14          addiction said the same thing.
15                National publications were talking about
16          the issue in the 40's and the 50's.  Again, you
17          saw this information, Dr. Hoff presented this
18          information to you, published in magazines like
19          Reader's Digest in the 40's and the 50's.  This
20          information was not a secret.
21                It certainly wasn't a secret to Shirley
22          Barbanell because she told Leon she knew about
23          it before the two of them were ever married,
24          before they were ever married.
25                There is no doubt that Shirley made an

 1          informed choice to smoke.  No doubt she made an
 2          informed choice to smoke.  And you know why.
 3          You know why.  Because -- Shirley smoked
 4          because she enjoyed it.  Mr. Barbanell told you
 5          all these things, too.
 6                Mr. Hammer mentioned this, but this
 7          testimony is undenied, uncontradicted,
 8          undisputed in this case.  Shirley liked to
 9          smoke cigarettes.  She liked the taste of
10          cigarettes.  She said it relaxed her.  It
11          relaxed her.  She loved the feel of a cigarette
12          in her hand.  She loved the feel of a cigarette
13          in her hand.  She liked the social aspects of 14          smoking.
15                You heard how she liked to smoke with her
16          girlfriends, when she was talking on the phone
17          with her girlfriends, when she was playing
18          cards, with coffee, after a meal.
19                What did Mr. Barbanell tell you?  He said
20          she enjoyed the, quote, joy of smoking.  Again,
21          that was Mr. Barbanell.  That was
22          Mr. Barbanell, himself, who told you all those
23          things; the man who knew her best, the man who
24          was married to her for 40 years.  That's what
25          Mr. Barbanell told you.

 1                Now, Mr. Barbanell told you, also, that
 2          there were times when he started to bug Shirley
 3          about quitting smoking; and what did Shirley
 4          Barbanell say to Mr. Barbanell when he nagged
 5          her to quit?  Mind your own business.
 6                That's what Shirley would tell Leon
 7          Barbanell, that's what she told her older
 8          sister, Rose, because she didn't want to hear
 9          it.  She enjoyed smoking, and she didn't want
10          anybody telling her what to do.  She didn't
11          want anybody telling her what to do.  And you
12          know what?  That's perfectly acceptable.
13          That's perfectly acceptable for her to feel
14          that way.
15                And that leads to another important part
16          of the admission that the plaintiff has made in
17          this case.  By saying she shares
18          responsibility, it means that Mrs. Barbanell
19          had control over her smoking.  She could
20          control her smoking when she wanted.  She could
21          quit when she wanted to, if she chose to quit.
22                Again, you've heard it's the undisputed
23          evidence that comes from the experts brought to
24          you in this case by the plaintiff --
25                Remember you heard from Dr. Benowitz by

 1          video, Dr. Neal Benowitz, and Dr. Seely.  They
 2          were both experts on cigarettes and nicotine
 3          addiction, offered by the plaintiff.  And they
 4          told you unequivocally, the single most
 5          important factor that will determine whether
 6          somebody can quit smoking, is what?  Not the
 7          nicotine in cigarettes.  Motivation.
 8          Motivation.  That's what Dr. Benowitz and
 9          Dr. Seely both told you.
10                And what did they tell you, where does
11          that motivation come from?  It comes from
12          within.  We each have to have that motivation.
13          Leon Barbanell can't give the motivation to
14          Shirley, Karen can't give the motivation to
15          Shirley, that's got to be something that the
16          individual wants.
17                And you saw these statistics, so you know
18          that it all is about motivation.  These were
19          the facts -- these were the facts about
20          quitting cigarette smoking as told to you,
21          again, by Dr. Seely and Dr. Benowitz.
22                Sixty million people in this country have
23          quit smoking.  1.3 million per year, 3,000
24          every single day.  And many of these smokers 25          just like Shirley are heavy smokers, two- and

 1          as many as three-pack-per-day smokers.
 2                Ninety percent of the 60 million people
 3          have quit cold turkey, which means they just
 4          laid the cigarettes down, and with their
 5          motivation they said, I'm not doing this
 6          anymore.  They did it without the assistance of
 7          any kind of smoking cessation device or
 8          therapy.
 9                And those doctors also told you anyone
10          who is motivated can quit, and that motivation
11          is the key factor.  Those facts are undisputed
12          in this case.
13                And what have you heard?  Have you heard
14          any evidence that tells you that Shirley
15          Barbanell was any different from the 60 million
16          people who have already quit?  You haven't
17          heard any testimony that she was different,
18          other than the fact that, according to
19          Mr. Barbanell, she was not motivated to quit
20          smoking.
21                You'll remember that I asked
22          Mr. Barbanell a question when he was -- when he
23          was testifying in Phase 1.  Here's his
24          testimony:
25                If you had a scale of motivation, and at

 1          one end of the scale is you would do anything
 2          possible to quit, and at the other end of the
 3          scale, the bottom of the scale, maybe you would
 4          try.  You agree that your wife was at the
 5          bottom end of the scale?
 6                Answer:  At that time, yes, yeah.
 7                So, she was closer to the bottom of the
 8          scale of motivation?
 9                Yeah, that's right.
10                As far as her desire to quit smoking is
11          concerned?
12                Right.
13                That was Mr. Barbanell.  He was very
14          candid with you.  Very candid about these
15          things.
16                Mr. Barbanell told you that in the 40
17          years that they were married, in the nearly 40
18          years they were married, Shirley only tried to
19          quit smoking three times.
20                He said that she tried -- she went to a
21          hypnotist once or twice.  She tried the
22          nicotine patch for about a week.  And she went
23          to a stop smoking class on one occasion, she
24          came back and she told Leon, it's not worth it,
25          I don't want to do this, I don't like it.

 1                Leon told you about Shirley's
 2          personality.  He told you she was intelligent,
 3          she was strong, she was strong-willed, she was
 4          independent, and she did what she wanted to do.
 5          That was the testimony you heard from Leon.
 6                And what do we know?  We know that
 7          Shirley did quit smoking in December 1990.  We
 8          know that because a month later, in
 9          January 1991, when she went to see 10          Dr. Schwartz, she told Dr. Schwartz that she
11          had quit one month earlier, in December 1990.
12                Now, we have -- we don't have any
13          evidence to know how long she quit, we have no
14          evidence of that.  All we know is that in 1995,
15          and you saw the record in Phase 1, in 1995,
16          when she went to have the pulmonary function
17          test, she reported that she was smoking less
18          than a pack of cigarettes per day.
19                What's significant about this record,
20          which you saw, is there's no evidence that
21          Shirley had any difficulty quitting, and
22          there's no evidence that she had any serious
23          withdrawal symptoms when she quit.  It's a
24          three-page medical record, you have it in
25          evidence.  There's no evidence of any

 1          withdrawal symptoms.
 2                The undisputed evidence is that Shirley
 3          was in control of her smoking, and she could
 4          quit, she had the ability to quit, and she
 5          could quit whenever she set her mind to do so.
 6          The plaintiff has admitted that to you in this
 7          phase of the case.
 8                Ladies and gentleman, these facts are
 9          unrefuted.  Shirley was well aware of the
10          health risks of smoking.  She smoked for 45 to
11          50 years.  She enjoyed smoking cigarettes.  She
12          lived until she was 73 years old, and she
13          enjoyed her life.  She lived her life the way
14          she wanted to.  She did what she wanted to do.
15                Now, I'm not trying to tell you that
16          Mr. Barbanell did not suffer a loss when his
17          wife passed away in April 1996.  Of course, he
18          did.  Of course, he did.  We all heard him
19          testify.
20                He had a wonderful marriage.  He had a
21          wonderful marriage.  You heard that.  But when
22          you live your life exactly the way you want to
23          live it, when you live your life exactly the
24          way you want to live it, should someone else be
25          held responsible or legally liable when

 1          something unfortunate happens and you pass
 2          away?
 3                That's what the plaintiff is asking you
 4          to do in this case.  You should think about
 5          that question when you retire to deliberate and
 6          when you are deciding whether the amount of
 7          money Mr. Hammer has asked you for is
 8          appropriate.
 9                Two-and-a-half weeks ago when you were
10          first selected as the jurors in this case,
11          you'll remember you took an oath, you took an
12          oath as jurors, and part of that oath required
13          that you do two things:  That whatever
14          decisions you ultimately make on this case, and
15          whatever issues are presented to you, that you
16          base those decisions on two things, two things,
17          and two things alone.  One, solely on the
18          evidence you've heard in this case, the
19          testimony of the witnesses and the documents
20          you've received; and, two, based on the 21          instructions of law that you're going to be
22          given by Judge Streitfeld.  And we know that
23          you have taken that oath very, very seriously,
24          very seriously.
25                And when you look at the evidence in this

 1          case, the evidence in this case, there is no
 2          evidence that anything Philip Morris did or
 3          didn't do, said or didn't say, impacted or
 4          influenced Shirley's decisions to smoke.  And,
 5          therefore, they are not the legal cause, they
 6          are not the legal cause.
 7                So, when you get to that verdict form and
 8          you go through these questions, Question Number
 9          One:  Was the negligence on the part of Philip
10          Morris USA a legal cause of Shirley Barbanell's
11          death?  The answer should be "no."  That's the
12          only answer that's consistent with the evidence
13          you've heard from the two witnesses, the two
14          people who knew Shirley Barbanell best, Karen
15          and Leon.
16                Question Number 2:  Were the defective
17          cigarettes by reason of their design which were
18          manufactured by Philip Morris USA, a legal
19          cause of Shirley Barbanell's death?  The answer
20          to that question should be "no."  The only
21          answer consistent with the evidence you've
22          heard in this case.
23                Question Number 3:  Were the cigarettes
24          manufactured by Philip Morris USA, which are
25          defective due to being unfit for the uses

 1          intended or reasonably foreseeable, a legal
 2          cause of Shirley Barbanell's death?  The
 3          answer, again, is "no."
 4                Then when you get to Question Number 4,
 5          comparative fault, I want you to think about
 6          all the evidence you've heard from
 7          Mr. Barbanell and Karen Siegel, about Shirley,
 8          and about how she lived her life, and think
 9          about the admission that Mr. Hammer made at the
10          very beginning of this case, that she is
11          responsible, that she is at fault.  Those were
12          his words, not mine.  Those were his words.
13                So, when you get to Question Number 4,
14          you have to rely upon the evidence you've heard
15          and you evaluate to the best that you can.
16                And, then, of course, Question Number 5
17          asks you about damages.
18                Now, I'm going to sit down in a moment,
19          and Mr. Hammer's going to get up and he's going
20          to have the last chance to speak to you, and in
21          a few minutes you're not going to hear from any
22          more lawyers, you're going to get the
23          instructions and you're going to get to retire
24          to deliberate, and I'm sure you're very happy
25          that we've reached that point of the trial.  I

 1          know it's been a very long time.
 2                But I want you to ask yourself this
 3          question:  When Mr. Hammer gets up, he's going
 4          to talk a lot about Philip Morris, no doubt.
 5          We all know that.  But ask yourself this  6          question:  Ask yourself if he can show you
 7          where Shirley, any of the testimony from Leon
 8          or Karen, where either one of the two people
 9          who knew Shirley best, ever said that anything
10          Philip Morris did influenced her, that anything
11          any of these organizations ever did influenced
12          her.  There is no evidence of that.  And that's
13          what you need to decide in this phase of the
14          case.  That's what you need to decide.  That's
15          what these questions are asking you to address.
16                I want to thank you very much for your
17          time and attention.  Thank you.
