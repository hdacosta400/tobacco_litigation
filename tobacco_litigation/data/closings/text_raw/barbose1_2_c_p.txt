MR. BIGGER:
If I get there.
That's perfect.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everybody.
Nice to see
Thank you, again, obviously.
So this is sort of the end of the

You all have gone
Ms. Barbose, our whole team.
above and beyond your civic duty, and then some.
It's a long trial.
You did the 26 miles, you've

So thank you very much.
finish line is right there.
And I just would encourage you, as you have been all
along, please, you know, attentiveness this
afternoon and just run across that finish line. You
all have done such a great job so far.
Something that you heard a lot in this trial, I
think from both sides, but especially from the other
side, from the defense, was to keep your eye on the 4129
And I'm going to sort of embrace that theme a

little bit now.
have heard from the defense and from our side in
closings.
If you can put that up, Baron.
"What does this have to do with John Barbose?"
And I'm using this because, today, what does -- what
does all this stuff we heard today have to do with
John Barbose?
And you saw that in our cross.
When we were talking to Dr. Figlar and
Dr. Jupe, they talked about a lot of things that we
all would agree are good things.
things that they're doing, and that's great. It
doesn't have anything to do with John Barbose, is
the problem.
They're good
And we're here today because the conduct that
you all heard about during the trial, during the
first part of the trial, was the type of conduct
that you all felt needed to be punished.
type of conduct that needed to be -- it was not
acceptable and needed to be punished, and you came
back today to do that.
It was the
So all the things we heard today about other
cases, other Engle cases, that's not Mr. Barbose's
case, that's not Mrs. Barbose's case.
Other 4130
companies and subsidiaries, the companies that make
the ZONNIC or these other products, that's not R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company.
It's some other stuff.
And it certainly was not around for John Barbose.
The other products they're making now, that was
not stuff available during Mr. Barbose's lifetime.
Other people at the company now.
Those folks that we are here
talked about that.
about, the conduct that brought us here, that was
during Mr. Barbose's lifetime.
You know, we

None of that happened during

that they're turning over a new leaf and trying to
do that now.
Mr. Barbose's lifetime.
the documents that are related to the inner workings
of the companies, again, none of that was during
Mr. Barbose's lifetime.
We saw the opposite. And
So ask yourself that question.
Of all this
stuff, what did it have to do with John Barbose
personally?
heard that caused his death?
caused his death.
You all decided it
Does it change anything, the conduct we
You can put that one down, Baron, if you want.
During Mr. Barbose's lifetime, the only guiding 4131
principles or guiding beliefs that we heard about
from Dr. Figlar were not, you know, of good policy.
They were not helpful policies.
They were, instead, policies
cooperative policies.
of concealment, policies of lies and of deceiving.
That's what we heard about, not nicotine replacement
therapies or gums, not migrating smokers to
harm-reduction products.
They were not
They couldn't talk about harm-reduction
That's why
If they were to create a
products when they were denying harm.
you didn't see any of that stuff during
Mr. Barbose's lifetime.
harm-reduced product, they would have to acknowledge
that their products were causing harm, and they
could not do that.
They were not willing to do
that, they chose not to do that, and that's why
Mr. Barbose died.
They weren't transforming anything at that
time.
They were the same company you heard about,
and it's still the same conduct that leads us here
today.
So I want to just take a second, if we can,
because you heard me say from the very beginning of
the case, evidence and law.
matters, applying the evidence to the law that
That's all that 4132
His Honor has given you.
And, thankfully, the
instructions are a lot smaller on this phase.
Let me just take a second, if I can, and look
at a couple of these to just make a -- maybe
emphasize a few things here, if I can.
So the instructions His Honor gave you -- and,
you know, there is -- obviously, you can read them
all, you can use them all.
I wanted to highlight
them, just to call your attention.
You know, you were to decide the amount of
punitive damages, if any, to be assessed as a
punishment and as a deterrent to others.
And
there's two parts there, so you have to assess them
as a punishment and as a deterrent to others.
And I think a lot of stuff you heard from
Dr. Figlar and Dr. Gentry [sic] talks to No. 3,
whether there's a continuing need for deterrence.
That's kind of why they brought him in, to say, You
don't need to deter us, we're different, okay?
We have said from the beginning, and the law
says, that you are also to assess punishment.
That's what we're here for, okay?
punishment, because this isn't just an isolated
incident.
It wasn't a slip-up, a little mistake
here and there.
This was a concentrated effort over
We're here for 4133
many, many decades to do what led to John Barbose's
death and, unfortunately, the deaths of many others,
as well, like him.
So that's the key here.
The nature, extent,
and degree of each defendant's misconduct and the
related circumstances.
None of that was addressed
today.
we have nothing to say to that.
In fact, they told you, we can't address it,
The award is to be no greater than the amount
you find necessary to punish Reynolds and Philip
Morris for the harm caused to John Barbose.
In the
instructions from the Court, in the law, the amount
of punitive damages is based on harm suffered by
John Barbose.
questions we did ask, you know, was any of this
happening during his lifetime?
all of them was no.
That's why we asked all those
And the answer to

But the amount that
focus on a little bit later.

considered in relation to the amount of compensatory

rational relationship, right, some reasonable
relationship between the compensatory damages and
the amount you award today for punitive damages.
So there needs to be some 4134
You'll obviously have that
That's the instructions.
from the judge.
consider as well, as you did in the first part of
the phase.
You'll have that back there to
And, again, the standard -- we're back to the
greater weight of the evidence standard to apply as
far as what that amount should be based on the
evidence you saw.
And so the question is, then, what does the
evidence prove is the appropriate amount of punitive
damages.
Now that you agree we should be here, what
is the appropriate amount?
You know, the other side will probably say, you
could get up there and you can put down zero if you
want, you could decline to assess.

You could do
I mean, you all saw the conduct, you saw what

think that's what's right, then, obviously, you all,
in your collective wisdom, do that.
certainly believe the evidence in this case supports
an award of punishment because of what these
companies did for all those years.
But we
So let me just talk briefly about a couple of
things. 4135
The harm-reduction concept.
I explained why
there was no harm reduction during Mr. Barbose's
lifetime, because they couldn't -- they couldn't
But there were

people inside the company who wanted to do it, who
had the ideas.
In fact, it's a very familiar name
that you've heard before, Dr. Teague, the same
gentleman that did the research and concluded that
smoking cigarettes did cause lung cancer in 1953 and
said that management should take action on this.
Unfortunately, management chose the course of

found that Dr. Teague did other stuff as well. Some
of those youth brands, some of the crucial role of
nicotine in the business, that was Dr. Teague.
He had another product back in -- another idea
back in 1969.
If we can put that up, Baron.
And this is PT

"Proposal for a new consumer-oriented business
strategy for RJR."
Right.
And if you look at what's in this document,
what Dr. Teague is talking about, it's going to look
very familiar to some of the things you heard from
Dr. Figlar today, right?
A product that just heats

the ideas Dr. Teague had way back in 1969, but he
wasn't allowed to work on those because those were
not consistent with the concealment campaign.
So these ideas could have been done during John
Barbose's lifetime.
folks, okay?
They just chose not to do it,
The Master Settlement Agreement, the FSA, the
FDA, the fees that are paid, all those sort of
things, obviously, none of that had anything to do
with John Barbose.
It wasn't during his lifetime.
But I think the message was clear from you all.
Unfortunately, that's just the cost of doing 4137

of that was for the harm caused to John Barbose,

really want to tout cigarette smoke as a drug. It
is, of course, but there are dangerous FDA

This was in 1969 as well, right?

They didn't
They chose instead to continue to
These things that Dr. -- excuse me -- that
Mr. Jupe talked about that were, you know, in his
estimation good things -- and they very well might
be -- they didn't need to be done after John Barbose
died, they could have been done during his lifetime,
folks.
You saw that evidence that's in the case.
But, unfortunately, the principal thought at that
time was "Who ain't for more money?"
It was more
money, more sales, more traditional cigarette sales.
That was the focus, not any cooperation.
And this -- these conducts, these activities in
the 1960s, 1970s, this is the stuff that caused harm
to John Barbose.
That was the only --
You can put that down, if you want, Baron.
The only evidence you heard -- excuse me --
that occurred during John Barbose's lifetime was,
unfortunately, fraud and conspiracy.
That was the
evidence that you saw about what happened during
John Barbose's lifetime.
And RJR and PM may have
done good things in the last 20 years.
They didn't
do it when it would have made a difference to John
Barbose, and so they need to be punished for that. 4139
That's what we're asking you to do.
Not one thing that you heard about over the
hours today changed the decision in 1953 to choose
profits over people or to choose money over safety
when they could have just told people.
You saw the

saved, including Mr. Barbose's life, would have been
enormous.
The difference in lives
You know, Dr. Figlar talked about the Ebola
situation, saving a couple of people with Ebola.
Hundreds of thousands of people could have been
saved -- millions of people could have been saved by
the decisions made during John Barbose's lifetime.
That's why we're here today for this phase.
Anything
So the question that you'll have to decide is,
And make
what is the appropriate amount of damages?
no mistake about it, folks, the only thing we want
you to award is a lawful amount, okay?
that is consistent with the law is what we're asking
you to award.
And that's why I drew your attention
to that section, because there needs to be a
reasonable relationship.
If you give an amount that is too large, it's
considered unlawful and it won't go.
received.
That's what the law says.
It will not be A punishment is only a punishment if it's made

Okay?
So we want to make it
to be paid, folks.
very clear that we only want you to award what we
believe is a lawful amount.
ask you for that amount and not any more, not any
less; what we believe is a lawful amount.
And we're only going to
You saw that in 1953, rather than come clean
With knowledge of all of the consequences of
their choices, you saw what they did in all those
years.
and tell the truth, they decided to double down.
You heard me say that before in closings yesterday.
When they knew that their products were causing
cancer, when they knew that most of their smokers
were starting as kids, instead of making the
decision to come clean and tell the truth, they
doubled down, they went more aggressive on their
marketing, they continued to make the product
designed for addiction.
that you saw.
They did all those things
And we use the phrase "double down," because
So we're
they just went more aggressively at it.
going to ask you to do -- as an appropriate
punishment for these defendants, we're going to ask
you to double up, okay?
We're going to ask you to
double up the compensatory damages that you gave in 4141
the first part of the case for each defendant. All
right?
Double up the damages that you awarded as

damages as a lawful amount against these companies.
It bears a reasonable relationship to the amount of
compensatory damages.
That's the
penalty we are asking you to have them pay because
of the choices that they made and how bad those
choices were.
It's one-to-one.
Now, I want to make this very clear.
And this

That's what they'll have to pay if you
Do not give them more.
Do not give us more.
We do not want more
But we do want you to give this family every 4142
Because $10
penny of that $10 million, okay?
million punitive damages award against each of these
defendants sends the right message.
It sends
the message to Richmond, Virginia, to Winston-Salem
that this kind of conduct is not tolerated.
Okay?
That's what your verdict is supposed to do as a
punitive damages verdict.
It's supposed to tell
them, no.
Okay?
I think I told you during closings that if you
don't do this, you might as well paint a blue ribbon
on their chest, okay, and tell them, "Good job."
The opposite side of that is, by punishing
them, you're sending the message that this will not
be tolerated, activities like this will not be
tolerated any more.
And that's what we're asking
you to do with this verdict, is to send them that
message.
If you do it fast enough, Dr. Figlar and
Dr. Jupe could probably take it back with them on
the plane.
declare in Winston-Salem and in Richmond that it's

punishment for the harms caused to this family, to
John Barbose -- not about other cases, not about
other people, not about other stuff; this family and
what they did to him.
But we want your verdict today to
Make today John Barbose Day
Okay?
Because it's about 4143
in Richmond and in Winston-Salem.
Okay?
Thank you, folks.
