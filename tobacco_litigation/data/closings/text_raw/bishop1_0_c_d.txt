6          MR. WALKER:  Good afternoon, ladies and         13:38:56
7     gentlemen.  I want to start where Mr. Clark did, and 13:38:57
8     just echo what he said, thanking you all for your    13:39:01
9     service in this case.  He was really right when he   13:39:04
10     said that everybody here, the staff, the lawyers for 13:39:06
11     both sides, really all of our clients really and     13:39:09
12     truly appreciate the sacrifice that you've all made  13:39:12
13     to be here. 13:39:14
14          You've been very conscientious.  We all kind of 13:39:15
15     watched to see when you're taking notes and, you     13:39:17
16     know, who's really listening and paying attention,   13:39:21
17     and you really all have been.                        13:39:22
18          And we just really all appreciate that and I    13:39:23
19     need that to be the first thing that I say to you on 13:39:26
20     behalf of everyone here, on behalf of my client, we  13:39:29
21     really, really appreciate your service.              13:39:32
22          Um, as to the other folks who spoke that I      13:39:34
23     brought some remarks along with me that I want to    13:39:38
24     discuss with you, but before I say anything else, I  13:39:40
25     want to talk to you about something because I was    13:39:43

1     sitting there listening to Mr. Berg and Mr. Clark    13:39:45
2     and it occurred to me that there's something that    13:39:47
3     we've all seen throughout all of the evidence.  It   13:39:49
4     maybe hasn't really been yet and maybe it's time to  13:39:52
5     say this. 13:39:55
6          The fact is, the reality is that when it comes  13:39:56
7     to cigarette smoking, there are people who enjoy     13:39:59
8     smoking cigarettes.  There are people who want to    13:40:03
9     smoke cigarettes, even though they know that smoking 13:40:07
10     cigarettes is a dangerous activity.                  13:40:10
11          That's true today in 2014, that there are       13:40:13
12     millions of people who know the risks and who        13:40:16
13     nevertheless like to smoke and want to smoke.  And   13:40:20
14     the evidence showed you in this case that that was   13:40:22
15     true in the 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1970s and    13:40:24
16     throughout Mr. Ramsay's lifetime.                    13:40:29
17          The fact of the matter is, you don't have to be 13:40:32
18     addicted to want to smoke cigarettes.  You don't     13:40:34
19     have to be fooled, you don't have to be ignorant of  13:40:37
20     the risk, you don't have to be any of those things   13:40:40
21     because there are people in this world now and then  13:40:42
22     who like smoking cigarettes and are comfortable with 13:40:45
23     the risks that you take when you smoke cigarettes.   13:40:48
24          Just like there are people who know the risks   13:40:51
25     of riding a motorcycle, and who are comfortable of   13:40:53

1     taking those risks because they like riding          13:40:56
2     motorcycles.  There are people who are comfortable   13:40:59
3     with the risk of not eating right who know those     13:41:00
4     risks, but take them because they like to eat a      13:41:03
5     certain way. 13:41:06
6          The evidence is going to be in this case that   13:41:07
7     when it came to smoking, Mr. Ramsay was one of       13:41:10
8     millions of Americans who, frankly, enjoyed smoking. 13:41:14
9     It relaxed him.  It helped him deal with the stress  13:41:18
10     of his work.  And he knew the risks and did not      13:41:22
11     smoke because of any of the things that have been    13:41:25
12     asserted in this case.                               13:41:28
13          Now, um, one of the things I need to address up 13:41:29
14     front, too, is the fact that there was a suggestion  13:41:35
15     that the defendants, that we didn't call any         13:41:37
16     witnesses.  That all you heard from us was a short   13:41:40
17     clip of Mrs. Ramsay that we played during our case,  13:41:43
18     and that's not quite right.                          13:41:47
19          And the reason I say that's not quite right is  13:41:48
20     because the reason we didn't need to call witnesses  13:41:52
21     in our case is because they called our witnesses for 13:41:54
22     us.  They spent hours and hours and hours with       13:41:57
23     witnesses that they were paying by the hour to come  13:42:01
24     here and talk to you about -- about a number of      13:42:04
25     different subjects.  And we, just like we said we    13:42:06

1     might do in jury selection, we got in a lot of the   13:42:10
2     facts and the evidence that were relevant to our     13:42:13
3     point of view in this case through their witnesses.  13:42:16
4     And I want to give you some examples.                13:42:18
5          Yeah, I could have called a witness who would   13:42:20
6     come here and tell you that Mr. Ramsay knew the      13:42:24
7     risks of cigarette smoking the entire time that he   13:42:26
8     smoked, but I didn't need to do that because         13:42:30
9     Mrs. Bishop took the stand and told you that under   13:42:35
10     oath. 13:42:35
11          She told you that Mr. Ramsay knew the risks of  13:42:36
12     cigarette smoking the entire time that he smoked.    13:42:40
13     You heard evidence that the warning labels were on   13:42:41
14     the packages for almost the entire time that he      13:42:43
15     smoked, and that Mrs. Ramsay, their son and their    13:42:46
16     daughter were constantly warning Mr. Ramsay about    13:42:50
17     the health risks of cigarette smoking.               13:42:52
18          There was a suggestion about how Mr. Ramsay     13:42:56
19     started smoking when there were no warning labels.   13:42:59
20     Yeah, that's true, but the warning labels were never 13:43:02
21     the only source of information about the health      13:43:05
22     risks of cigarette smoking.                          13:43:07
23          You heard evidence in this case about all the   13:43:07
24     other ways that smokers and nonsmokers and everyone  13:43:10
25     else in America learned about the health risks of    13:43:13

1     cigarette smoking.  And I want to show you a slide   13:43:17
2     with just one example of that.                       13:43:19
3          Remember you heard this in the case.  This was  13:43:21
4     the Surgeon General in 1957.  That's right around    13:43:25
5     the time that Mrs. Bishop meets Mr. Ramsay.  And     13:43:28
6     Dr. -- and Surgeon General Burney was saying in 1957 13:43:34
7     that the position of the Surgeon General is that he  13:43:38
8     had informed the public through the excellent        13:43:41
9     coverage of the press, radio and TV.  And we showed  13:43:43
10     you the press and the TV.                            13:43:46
11          Could I have called in another witness to       13:43:48
12     repeat what Mrs. Bishop said to repeat all this      13:43:50
13     evidence?  Sure.  We could have been here another    13:43:53
14     two or three days listening to that.  But I didn't   13:43:55
15     need to because we got that in through their         13:43:58
16     witnesses.  13:44:00
17          I could have called a witness here to tell you  13:44:01
18     that Mr. Ramsay had the ability to quit smoking.  We 13:44:02
19     could have -- we could have put on hours of          13:44:06
20     testimony about that.  But I didn't need to do that  13:44:09
21     because Mrs. Bishop told you that Mr. Ramsay did     13:44:11
22     quit smoking in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.  13:44:14
23          The fact that Mr. Bishop [sic] quit in the late 13:44:18
24     1980s and 1990s the very first time he made an       13:44:21
25     asserted effort to quit tells you that he could have 13:44:24

1     accomplished the same thing earlier in his smoking   13:44:28
2     career had he been interested in doing that.         13:44:31
3          Mr. Clark said that we didn't call a witness to 13:44:33
4     address all the design features, and he -- he -- he  13:44:37
5     went up to the witness stand, talking about          13:44:40
6     Dr. Villa.  Well, this is what -- Mr. Clark came up  13:44:43
7     here (indicating), and he said -- remember he        13:44:46
8     said -- Dr. Villa stood up here and he talked to you 13:44:51
9     about lung cancer and all of these different things. 13:44:53
10     He did all of those things, that's true.             13:44:55
11          Then when Mr. Clark sat down, Mr. -- Dr. Villa  13:44:58
12     sat down and he started answering questions of       13:45:02
13     Mr. Isasi.  And do you know what he said when he was 13:45:04
14     answering those questions?  He said that each and    13:45:06
15     every one of those design features that you spent    13:45:09
16     all day hearing about from Dr. Henningfield didn't   13:45:11
17     make a pill of difference to Mr. Ramsay.             13:45:15
18          Whether Mr. Ramsay was smoking filtered         13:45:18
19     cigarettes or unfiltered cigarettes, cigarettes with 13:45:20
20     overwrap, cigarettes without overwrap, any of those  13:45:23
21     design features on that chart didn't mean anything   13:45:26
22     to Dr. Villa about the cause of Mr. Ramsay's cancer. 13:45:29
23          I could have called a witness here to tell you  13:45:32
24     that the only thing that mattered to Mr. Ramsay is   13:45:34
25     when he decided to quit smoking.  Didn't need to do  13:45:37

1     that because Dr. Villa, right from this witness      13:45:41
2     stand where I was sitting, told you that had         13:45:44
3     Mr. Ramsay quit smoking in 1964, when the United     13:45:47
4     States Surgeon General's report came out, he would   13:45:51
5     have eliminated 97 to 98 percent of his risk of      13:45:52
6     getting lung cancer from smoking.                    13:45:57
7          Dr. Villa told you that if Mr. Ramsay had quit  13:46:00
8     smoking even in 1974 after the collapsed lung, if he 13:46:03
9     had stayed quit and not gone back to smoking         13:46:08
10     cigarettes, he would have eliminated over half of    13:46:10
11     his risk of getting lung cancer.                     13:46:12
12          That means that the choices that mattered to    13:46:15
13     Mr. Ramsay were the ones that Mr. Ramsay made, and   13:46:17
14     he, more likely than not, would not have gotten      13:46:21
15     cancer and died from cigarette smoking had he made a 13:46:24
16     different choice in 1964; and 1966, when the labels  13:46:27
17     went on; in 1970, when the labels changed; or in     13:46:32
18     1974, when he was off cigarettes for three and a     13:46:36
19     half weeks. 13:46:39
20          I didn't need to call a witness to tell you     13:46:40
21     those things because in this case the facts are our  13:46:43
22     witnesses.  The facts don't need $925 an hour to     13:46:47
23     tell you what the truth is about this case.  I don't 13:46:53
24     have to pay $5,600 a day to point out to you the     13:46:56
25     facts that prove our point in this case.  The facts  13:47:01

1     are our witnesses and those are the ones I'll be     13:47:05
2     talking about today that establish that there should 13:47:08
3     be a defense verdict.                                13:47:11
4          But before I leave this question about the      13:47:12
5     witnesses, I just told you that the facts are        13:47:16
6     unbiased, they're impartial, they're not paid.  What 13:47:18
7     about the plaintiffs' witnesses?  They told you in   13:47:20
8     opening statement they were going to bring           13:47:23
9     world-renowned experts.  And I said what you're      13:47:25
10     really going to see are some of the most biased      13:47:28
11     experts you've ever seen.  Because unlike the        13:47:31
12     process of selecting jurors, where we want people    13:47:33
13     who are impartial, who are unbiased, who can be      13:47:35
14     objective, that's not always how expert witnesses    13:47:38
15     are selected. 13:47:41
16          Can I have the next slide, please?              13:47:43
17          Take a look at three of the witnesses that the  13:47:44
18     plaintiffs brought you today, that they talked about 13:47:47
19     being world renowned.  There's Dr. Cummings on the   13:47:49
20     left.  He's the guy that's been paid a million       13:47:53
21     dollars testifying in almost 80 cases like this.     13:47:54
22     And he's the guy who told you from the witness stand 13:47:58
23     that he's been described as a mercenary, a soldier   13:48:01
24     for hire in these cases.                             13:48:03
25          Dr. Hurt on the right.  The one with the grin   13:48:08

1     there.  He's the one that's been paid $5,600 a day.  13:48:10
2     He's the guy who says not all smokers are addicted,  13:48:15
3     but yeah, every time I testify, I always say they're 13:48:18
4     addicted.  That's what $5,600 a day buys you.        13:48:21
5          Dr. Henningfield in the middle.  He's the one   13:48:26
6     that said he's on a crusade.  He's been on a crusade 13:48:28
7     against the tobacco companies.  And he's the one     13:48:32
8     who's been paid $925 an hour for his testimony.      13:48:34
9          If you do the math, that comes out to about $15 13:48:39
10     a minute.  There are people in this world who would  13:48:42
11     love to have a job that pays $15 an hour.  Every     13:48:45
12     minute that he was up there not giving a clean       13:48:49
13     answer to Mr. Isasi to a "yes" or "no" question, he  13:48:52
14     was getting paid $15 per minute.                     13:48:54
15          And remember -- if you remember Dr. Hurt and    13:49:00
16     Dr. Cummings, the ones on the outside.  Those are    13:49:04
17     the ones that all attended the same conference,      13:49:06
18     where they get together with plaintiffs' lawyers and 13:49:08
19     they try to figure out how to get a just verdict.  A 13:49:10
20     verdict with a big number.                           13:49:13
21          And those are the ones that receive this trial  13:49:14
22     in a box.  If you wondered why you are being shown   13:49:17
23     ads and clips and things that maybe didn't really    13:49:21
24     seem that relevant to Mr. Ramsay, you were going to  13:49:24
25     see them anyway.  Remember Dr. Cummings?             13:49:28

1     Dr. Cummings in the evidence that Mr. Ramsay, the    13:49:30
2     business executive at Texaco was watching the        13:49:33
3     Beverly Hillbillies and the Flintstones.  Oh, yeah.  13:49:36
4     Yeah, yeah.  I'm -- I'm going to put myself out      13:49:40
5     there on a limb like that.                           13:49:44
6          Dr. Cummings, Dr. Henningfield, Dr. Hurt are    13:49:45
7     going to show the same presentation to every jury in 13:49:47
8     this Engle class of smokers.  Maybe in some other    13:49:50
9     cases some of that evidence will apply.  The         13:49:55
10     evidence is going to be in this case it didn't apply 13:49:56
11     to Mr. Ramsay. 13:49:59
12          And the last thing I want to say about this is  13:50:01
13     remember Dr. Hurt?  Dr. Hurt's the one who gave such 13:50:04
14     a hard time to Mr. Fiorta over there when he was     13:50:09
15     trying to ask him the questions, and the funny thing 13:50:12
16     is right at the beginning of that presentation       13:50:15
17     Mr. Fiorta said, Dr. Hurt, I've got this PowerPoint  13:50:18
18     where you were given advice about how you're         13:50:20
19     supposed to act in court.  And your PowerPoint says  13:50:23
20     whatever you do, don't give anything up.  Avoid      13:50:25
21     "yes" or "no" answers.  Get in your messages as much 13:50:30
22     as you can.  And doggone it, that's what he did.     13:50:34
23          He avoided giving anything up.  He avoided any  13:50:38
24     kind of a "yes" or "no" answer.  He was going to say 13:50:41
25     what he wanted to say, whether it was responsive to  13:50:43

1     the question or not.                                 13:50:45
2          You saw the same thing from Dr. Cummings.       13:50:46
3     Getting a "yes" or "no" answer from Dr. Cummings was 13:50:50
4     like pulling teeth.  And you're going to be allowed  13:50:52
5     to consider -- can I have the next slide?            13:50:56
6          One of the instructions that you're going to    13:50:58
7     get is going to tell you all of the different ways   13:51:00
8     you can consider the credibility, the believability  13:51:03
9     of these witnesses.  You can consider the frankness  13:51:05
10     or lack of frankness of the witness.  Any interest   13:51:09
11     the witness may have in the outcome of the case.     13:51:12
12     That would include things like being paid a million  13:51:15
13     bucks or 900 bucks an hour.  The reasonableness of   13:51:17
14     the testimony of the witness.                        13:51:21
15          And the bottom line with these paid experts is  13:51:23
16     that you can accept the opinion of those experts,    13:51:26
17     you can reject it, or you can give it the weight     13:51:29
18     that you think it deserves.  And I'm going to talk   13:51:33
19     to you about the reasons why you shouldn't give much 13:51:35
20     weight to the testimony of their paid experts.       13:51:37
21          I want to show you one of the things that can   13:51:42
22     happen when there's a major credibility issue.  I    13:51:45
23     asked all of you in jury selection and in openings,  13:51:47
24     I said, I don't have the burden of proof; I'm always 13:51:51
25     going to go second.  That means I've got to sit over 13:51:53

1     there and wait while I'm hearing all of this         13:51:55
2     testimony going on and I'm thinking, what about      13:51:58
3     this?  What about that?  You didn't show this other  13:52:00
4     part. 13:52:02
5          And I asked each and every one of you if you    13:52:02
6     can wait until it was my turn to stand up and ask    13:52:05
7     questions so you could get the rest of the story.    13:52:08
8     And you all said you could do that.  And I could     13:52:10
9     tell that you were actually doing that.  And I want  13:52:13
10     to show you just a couple of examples why that's so  13:52:15
11     important, especially when you have paid witnesses   13:52:19
12     like this.  13:52:21
13          This is just one example.  On the right you see 13:52:22
14     this Teague document from 1972.  And they wanted to  13:52:24
15     show you a passage that said nicotine is a sine qua  13:52:29
16     non of tobacco products.  Like that was this huge    13:52:32
17     secret that the tobacco companies had buried in a    13:52:35
18     vault somewhere.                                     13:52:37
19          Only on cross-examination were we able to come  13:52:38
20     back and say, no, in Reader's Digest in 1950 when it 13:52:40
21     was the most popular magazine in America, that same  13:52:44
22     concept was being published 22 years earlier.        13:52:48
23     Nicotine is the essential ingredient of tobacco.     13:52:52
24     It's what makes tobacco tobacco, and not just        13:52:54
25     another weed. 13:52:57

1          Let's look at one more.  Here's another         13:52:58
2     example.  On the right is the Reynolds document from 13:53:02
3     1959 that they said, my God, the tobacco companies   13:53:04
4     know something no one else does.  They know that     13:53:06
5     there are eight polycyclic hydrocarbons isolated     13:53:10
6     from smoke.  That's the document from Dr. Rodgman    13:53:12
7     who was actually publishing on ways to know what was 13:53:16
8     in cigarette smoke.                                  13:53:19
9          We had to come back on cross-examination and    13:53:20
10     say, wait a minute.  November 1959?  That's the same 13:53:22
11     month, the same information was being printed        13:53:27
12     publicly in the most popular magazine in America.    13:53:31
13     They have identified eight carcinogenic polycyclics  13:53:35
14     in tobacco smoke and are on the trail of others.     13:53:40
15     That's why it's always been important in this case   13:53:43
16     to wait and withhold judgment to see both sides of   13:53:45
17     the story.  13:53:48
18          Now, we are closer to the end of this case than 13:53:49
19     we've ever been.  And I see some smiles maybe        13:53:55
20     because of that.  I know you're all heartbroken      13:53:59
21     about that.  It's okay.  But the reason we're close  13:54:01
22     to the end is because soon you're going to have a    13:54:04
23     chance to fill out this verdict form (indicating).   13:54:06
24          The verdict form that you get will look a lot   13:54:08
25     like this, but it won't have this blue highlighting. 13:54:11

1     The blue highlighting is every place on this verdict 13:54:14
2     form where there's a reference to Robert Ramsay.     13:54:17
3     And I did that to show you what I told you at the    13:54:19
4     beginning of this case.  This case is not about      13:54:22
5     every smoker in the world.  They must have said      13:54:25
6     about 20 times 20 million smokers were affected by   13:54:28
7     smoking. 13:54:32
8          It's not about 20 million smokers; it's about   13:54:32
9     one smoker, Robert Ramsay, and whether or not their  13:54:36
10     allegations mattered to him.                         13:54:38
11          Every question on the front page, second page,  13:54:40
12     throughout, you'll see when you get it, it's all     13:54:44
13     about one smoker and one smoker only, Robert Ramsay. 13:54:47
14          What I'm going to try to do, then, is I have my 13:54:51
15     copy, but I have some that I put on the PowerPoint.  13:54:57
16     I'm going to try to take you through the verdict     13:54:59
17     form and suggest to you what we think you saw in the 13:55:01
18     evidence.  You'll make your own decision, but I      13:55:03
19     think you're going to see that the right result in   13:55:06
20     this case is -- is a defense verdict.                13:55:10
21          But, um, when we get to those questions, think  13:55:12
22     about these things because I -- I'm not going to     13:55:17
23     keep saying this.  But I will -- I will say this     13:55:19
24     because I said it in opening.  What did we learn     13:55:21
25     about Mr. Ramsay?  We learned that Mr. Ramsay was a  13:55:24

1     willing smoker who smoked because he liked what      13:55:28
2     smoking did for him.  It relaxed him.  It helped him 13:55:31
3     cope with the stress of his job.                     13:55:34
4          The evidence was Mr. Ramsay smoked and          13:55:36
5     continued smoking because he wasn't interested in    13:55:38
6     quitting.  The first time he really was interested   13:55:40
7     in cutting down on his smoking, he cut down to what  13:55:43
8     Dr. Hurt told you was a nonaddictive level of        13:55:46
9     smoking in the late 1980s.                           13:55:49
10          The first time he was really interested in      13:55:51
11     quitting smoking altogether for his own reasons, not 13:55:53
12     because Mrs. Bishop wanted him to, for his own       13:55:57
13     reasons, Mr. Ramsay stopped smoking.  That's a fact. 13:55:59
14          The evidence that nicotine did not control      13:56:05
15     Mr. Ramsay, and we're going to talk more about that, 13:56:08
16     because there's evidence in this case about what     13:56:10
17     Mr. Ramsay did when he didn't even have any nicotine 13:56:12
18     in his system.  That's going to tell us everything   13:56:16
19     we need to know about whether nicotine turned        13:56:19
20     Mr. Ramsay into a robot.  And we're going to talk    13:56:22
21     about the evidence that Mr. Ramsay was not misled.   13:56:24
22          So let's pull up the very first question from   13:56:26
23     the verdict form.  Was Robert Ramsay addicted to     13:56:28
24     cigarettes containing nicotine, and if so, was such  13:56:33
25     addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer?          13:56:36

1          Couple of different issues bundled up in that.  13:56:38
2     You can think about that in at least three parts.    13:56:44
3     One part would be, is the nicotine in cigarettes     13:56:46
4     addictive at all?  And you actually heard a lot of   13:56:51
5     evidence about that.                                 13:56:54
6          Can I have the next slide?                      13:56:55
7          That the plaintiffs put on evidence through     13:56:56
8     Dr. Hurt, Dr. Henningfield and a bunch of documents  13:57:04
9     trying to show you that the nicotine in cigarettes   13:57:05
10     is addictive.  But you know what?  I told you that   13:57:08
11     in jury selection.  I told you in opening statements 13:57:11
12     that I was not going to come here and tell you that  13:57:14
13     the nicotine in cigarettes is not addictive.  No     13:57:17
14     dispute about that.                                  13:57:20
15          Some people who smoke cigarettes get addicted,  13:57:20
16     and some people who are addicted to cigarette        13:57:23
17     smoking have a hard time quitting.  That's not the   13:57:26
18     issue on the verdict form.  The issue on the verdict 13:57:29
19     form is about Mr. Ramsay.                            13:57:31
20          And it's been known for hundreds of years, by   13:57:32
21     the way, that the nicotine in cigarettes and tobacco 13:57:37
22     is addictive.  That's never been a secret.  And      13:57:41
23     Dr. Cummings told you that Reynolds and Philip       13:57:44
24     Morris never -- that Reynolds and Philip Morris did  13:57:48
25     not deny that nicotine was addictive in the 1950s,   13:57:50

1     in the 1960s or in the 1970s.  All those decades     13:57:56
2     when we'll see that Mr. Ramsay wasn't really trying  13:58:00
3     to quit, the companies weren't denying that the      13:58:03
4     nicotine in cigarettes was addictive.                13:58:05
5          Um, so then the question becomes, well, was     13:58:09
6     Mr. Ramsay addicted?  Was he addicted?  They claim   13:58:14
7     that he was, and most of their evidence about        13:58:18
8     whether Mr. Ramsay was addicted came from one        13:58:21
9     person, that same Dr. Hurt that I was talking about. 13:58:23
10     The guy who was paid all that money, who says, not   13:58:26
11     all smokers are addicted.  But every time I,         13:58:29
12     Dr. Hurt, testify, they're addicted.                 13:58:33
13          Then we said, well, okay.  How do you come up   13:58:37
14     with that?  How is it that you can tell this jury    13:58:40
15     that Mr. Ramsay was addicted?  He says, well, I've   13:58:42
16     got this Heaviness of Smoking Index.  When we start  13:58:45
17     to talk to him about it, you find out it's a rigged  13:58:48
18     test. 13:58:52
19          Can I have the next slide?                      13:58:52
20          Look at this test.  Think about this for one    13:58:55
21     second.  You're asked two questions.  And no matter  13:58:57
22     how you answer the questions, if you look down at    13:59:01
23     the scoring, the answer is always dependent.  No     13:59:04
24     matter whether you smoke, whether you don't smoke,   13:59:08
25     how many cigarettes a day you smoke, when you have   13:59:11

1     your first cigarette.  You could take somebody who's 13:59:13
2     never smoked their whole life, administer this test  13:59:17
3     to them, and the answer is going to be this person   13:59:20
4     is addicted.  They just have a low level of          13:59:22
5     addiction.  13:59:24
6          To use this test is to decide in advance that   13:59:25
7     the person is going to be addicted.  And the         13:59:29
8     interesting thing is, Dr. Hurt doesn't use this test 13:59:32
9     in his regular work.  In his regular work he uses a  13:59:34
10     completely different test called the Fagerstrom test 13:59:38
11     that has more variables and is scored differently.   13:59:41
12          Where does he use this Heaviness of Smoking     13:59:45
13     Index that's rigged to always come out an addicted   13:59:48
14     result?  In court.  Talking to juries like you.      13:59:51
15          The minute Dr. Hurt chose to use this test is   13:59:55
16     the minute he was not giving you an unbiased,        13:59:59
17     impartial opinion about whether Mr. Ramsay was       14:00:02
18     addicted.  There is no possible way to answer this   14:00:04
19     test to have an answer that's not addicted.          14:00:10
20          So you'll have to decide for yourself whether   14:00:13
21     that's good enough.  The plaintiffs have the burden  14:00:15
22     of proof.  We don't.  That's what they brought you,  14:00:18
23     a rigged test and a highly paid witness to deliver   14:00:20
24     it.   14:00:24
25          But the really important question isn't the two 14:00:24

1     that I've been talking about.  The really important  14:00:27
2     question is the verdict form question.               14:00:30
3          Was addiction a legal cause of Mr. Ramsay's     14:00:32
4     lung cancer?  And I want to just look with you at    14:00:36
5     the instruction that you're going to get about what  14:00:39
6     legal cause means.                                   14:00:41
7          This is basically the same instruction that --  14:00:42
8     that plaintiffs' counsel showed you, except they     14:00:45
9     didn't highlight the words that I'm showing you now. 14:00:48
10     "An addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is a 14:00:52
11     legal cause of disease or medical condition if it    14:00:54
12     directly and in a natural and continuous sequence    14:00:56
13     produces or contributes substantially to producing   14:01:00
14     such disease or medical condition so that it can     14:01:03
15     reasonably be said that but for" -- that's the key   14:01:07
16     language -- "but for the addiction to cigarettes     14:01:10
17     containing nicotine such disease or medical          14:01:13
18     condition would not have been suffered."             14:01:15
19          A lot of words in there.  You'll have time to   14:01:18
20     look over those as much as you want in the jury      14:01:21
21     room.  The bottom line is, this is the test.  If you 14:01:38
22     look at somebody who smokes, you ask yourselves, if  14:01:27
23     we take away this alleged addiction, would the       14:01:31
24     person still smoke?  If you take away the nicotine,  14:01:34
25     is the person still going to smoke?  And what does   14:01:39

1     the evidence show about that generally?              14:01:42
2          Let's take a look at the next one.              14:01:44
3          The question, again, is going to be, did        14:01:49
4     addiction lead continuously and substantially to     14:01:51
5     lung cancer? 14:01:55
6          Let's go to the next slide, please.             14:01:55
7          What was the evidence, not just about whether   14:01:57
8     people can be addicted or whether or not nicotine is 14:01:59
9     addictive; this is about what does addiction         14:02:02
10     actually do?  Does it actually turn people into      14:02:05
11     robots?  Does it change people's behavior?           14:02:08
12          This is what the evidence was.  "Nicotine does  14:02:12
13     not prevent smokers from choosing to try to quit."   14:02:14
14     Again, this is their expert.  "Many smokers who say  14:02:17
15     they want to quit, don't try.  Addicted smokers can  14:02:21
16     quit and even heavily addicted smokers can quit."    14:02:24
17          Let's look at one of the charts that was shown  14:02:29
18     to you by plaintiffs' witnesses.  Maybe you can      14:02:32
19     remember this one.  On the left you see there's a    14:02:34
20     percentage for daily smokers, and then to the right  14:02:40
21     of that you can see that there are many smokers who  14:02:42
22     don't even say that they want to quit.               14:02:46
23          Next to that, you can see that even among       14:02:49
24     people who say they want to quit, some don't         14:02:52
25     actually try to quit smoking.                        14:02:56

1          Can I have the next one, please?                14:02:59
2          This was the pamphlet that Dr. Cummings put     14:03:00
3     together that we also discussed with one of the      14:03:06
4     other experts. 14:03:08
5          This is their -- these are their witnesses      14:03:09
6     talking:  "Do you want to stop smoking?  Are you     14:03:12
7     willing to make some changes in your daily routine?  14:03:15
8     Are you willing to put up with some uneasy moments   14:03:22
9     after stopping?  If you can answer yes to all three  14:03:25
10     questions, you can stop smoking."                    14:03:28
11          This is their experts telling you that all      14:03:31
12     smokers, even ones who meet criteria for addiction,  14:03:34
13     can quit smoking.                                    14:03:37
14          And the evidence was also that there can be     14:03:39
15     different degrees of addiction.  You can be heavily  14:03:41
16     addicted and it might be harder for you to quit, or  14:03:45
17     you can be not as heavily addicted and you can be    14:03:47
18     successful quitting easier than some other people    14:03:51
19     can be. 14:03:54
20          Quitting smoking is a very individual thing.    14:03:55
21     And that's why we have to look at what the evidence  14:03:59
22     was for Mr. Ramsay.  But we're doing that knowing    14:04:02
23     that in America, there are 60 million Americans who  14:04:05
24     have quit smoking.  There are more people who are    14:04:09
25     former smokers than current smokers.                 14:04:12

1          The question becomes:  Was Mr. Ramsay so        14:04:15
2     addicted that he couldn't stop smoking, or did he    14:04:20
3     smoke as a matter of personal choice?  And I want to 14:04:23
4     take the first half of that first.                   14:04:27
5          Was Mr. Ramsay so addicted that he couldn't     14:04:29
6     stop smoking?  Well, we know the answer to that is   14:04:33
7     no.  Because Mr. Ramsay did quit smoking.            14:04:36
8          When they showed you this chart, they were      14:04:41
9     trying to say that only 3 percent of smokers who     14:04:43
10     attempt to quit at a given time are successful in    14:04:47
11     the long term.  That may be so.                      14:04:50
12          But if that's true, Mr. Ramsay is part of that  14:04:52
13     3 percent.  Because he did quit smoking the minute   14:04:55
14     he made an asserted effort to do so.                 14:05:00
15          It's true before that he experimented with      14:05:04
16     quitting while he went on vacation.  Mrs. Bishop     14:05:06
17     said once or twice a year they'd go on a vacation.   14:05:09
18     Mr. Ramsay would say, I'm on vacation, I'm taking a  14:05:12
19     vacation from smoking too.  And then a couple of     14:05:16
20     days later he'd give up on that.  She'd buy him      14:05:18
21     cigarettes and he'd be back to smoking again.  That  14:05:22
22     was not a concerted, committed effort to quit.       14:05:24
23          Mr. Clark, I think it was, said something about 14:05:29
24     chronic relapsing.  It's not chronic anything if you 14:05:32
25     only do it once a year.                              14:05:35

1          If you're only trying to quit once or twice a   14:05:38
2     year when you go on vacation, you are not somebody   14:05:41
3     who is constantly doing everything you can to try to 14:05:44
4     quit smoking and failing.  That's not what it is.    14:05:47
5          At some point he tried nicotine gum.  Sure.     14:05:51
6     But what did he really use the nicotine gum for?     14:05:57
7     While he was smoking the gum, did he ever put down   14:06:00
8     his cigarettes?  The testimony was he didn't.  While 14:06:04
9     he was on the gum, did he use the gum to reduce his  14:06:05
10     cigarette smoking?  He didn't do that either.        14:06:08
11          It was only in the late 1980s when Mr. Ramsay   14:06:11
12     made an asserted effort, that was the words          14:06:15
13     Mrs. Bishop used, an asserted effort to quit and he  14:06:19
14     succeeded.  14:06:22
15          Now, the second half of the question was, did   14:06:23
16     he smoke because he made a personal choice to do so? 14:06:25
17     Well, how can we figure that out?  How do we know?   14:06:28
18     The plaintiffs are saying, well, he smoked because   14:06:31
19     of nicotine.  He smoked because he was a young       14:06:33
20     person when he started.  He smoked because he didn't 14:06:35
21     know the risks.                                      14:06:38
22          How do we know whether those things are true?   14:06:38
23     For the same reason that Mr. Berg talked to you      14:06:41
24     about.  There's a very important piece of evidence   14:06:44
25     in this case that you've all heard about.  And       14:06:46

1     that's this episode that he had in the mid-1970s     14:06:48
2     where he had this collapsed lung.  And I just want   14:06:51
3     to show you this (indicating).                       14:06:54
4          During jury selection I asked almost each and   14:07:00
5     every one of you whether you had a moment in your    14:07:10
6     life where you were presented with the option to     14:07:12
7     smoke or not to smoke, and we talked a little bit    14:07:14
8     about how you viewed that situation and what you did 14:07:17
9     about it. 14:07:19
10          I'm showing you, and I'll tell you this:  I     14:07:20
11     believe this is Lake Eola.  Turns out I'm not from   14:07:23
12     Orlando.  So this is a neat lake that I saw around   14:07:27
13     here, and when I would try to go jogging before it   14:07:30
14     got really cold, I would go through this area.       14:07:32
15          And one day when I was -- when I was doing that 14:07:35
16     I thought, you know, if I keep running straight down 14:07:37
17     this path, I'm going to end up in this lake.  So it  14:07:39
18     turns out that you got to go left or you've got to   14:07:44
19     go right.  And that's a lot like what happened to    14:07:48
20     Mr. Ramsay in 1974.                                  14:07:50
21          He's on a business trip.  You all know the      14:07:53
22     story by now.  His lung collapsed.  He's freaking    14:07:55
23     out.  His colleague takes him to the hospital.  It   14:07:59
24     turns out he's unconscious for like ten days.  Ten   14:08:01
25     days he's out, knocked out to the world.  What's     14:08:04

1     happening during those ten days?                     14:08:07
2          Within ten hours the nicotine that was in his   14:08:09
3     system from whenever his last cigarette was went out 14:08:12
4     of his blood stream.  I didn't have to call a        14:08:15
5     witness to say that; Dr. Hurt admitted that.         14:08:17
6          That's just his blood stream.  Within a couple  14:08:19
7     of days, the nicotine is out of his body entirely.   14:08:22
8     There is no nicotine in his system at all.           14:08:26
9          He's still unconscious.  The witness has told   14:08:28
10     you that the peak withdrawal symptoms when           14:08:32
11     withdrawal is at its worst is within a few days      14:08:35
12     after you stop smoking.                              14:08:38
13          Day 1, day 2, day 3 can be very hard.  It       14:08:39
14     wasn't hard for Mr. Ramsay because he's unconscious. 14:08:44
15     He's in a hospital.  He can't smoke.  He's safe.  So 14:08:46
16     he basically slept through the peak withdrawal       14:08:50
17     symptoms that might make some smokers, if they're    14:08:54
18     addicted, want to start smoking again.  That wasn't  14:08:56
19     his experience.                                      14:09:00
20          Then Dr. Hurt said that withdrawal symptoms,    14:09:02
21     not just the peak, but any withdrawal symptoms, they 14:09:05
22     end within 14 to 21 days.  What happens in that 14   14:09:08
23     to 21 days?  Well, by day 10 Mr. Ramsay's            14:09:12
24     discharged.  He's very scared because he's aware of  14:09:17
25     the risk that his cigarette smoking may have somehow 14:09:20

1     contributed to his lung issue.  He's worried about   14:09:23
2     it.  Ms. Bishop is worried about it.  They're all    14:09:26
3     worried about it.                                    14:09:28
4          So he doesn't smoke the first day he's back     14:09:29
5     from the hospital or the second day or the rest of   14:09:32
6     that week.  He goes all the way into the second week 14:09:33
7     without smoking.                                     14:09:36
8          By this time he's 24 or 25 days out from his    14:09:38
9     last cigarette.  The withdrawal symptoms that        14:09:42
10     Dr. Hurt set in after 14 days or 21 days are over.   14:09:46
11     He's weeks away from having nicotine in his system.  14:09:51
12     He's weeks away from peak withdrawal symptoms.  He's 14:09:54
13     several days away from any withdrawal symptoms at    14:09:57
14     all.  14:09:59
15          And when we ask -- I asked Mrs. Bishop, how is  14:09:59
16     he acting?  Did you see any difference to his        14:10:03
17     personality?  She didn't report any withdrawal       14:10:06
18     symptoms.  She didn't say he was climbing the walls  14:10:08
19     or irritable or anxious.                             14:10:10
20          So he goes to see the doctor.  What else is     14:10:13
21     going on at this point in his life?  The warning     14:10:17
22     labels have been on the packages for almost ten      14:10:20
23     years.  He's got the information from Mrs. Bishop    14:10:22
24     for almost ten years, perhaps more, that smoking is  14:10:28
25     bad for him. 14:10:31

1          People are saying things to him like you've got 14:10:32
2     to stop smoking.  It's killing you.  He's saying to  14:10:34
3     other people, I know.  He's telling his own          14:10:37
4     children, who are born by this time, you shouldn't   14:10:42
5     smoke because it's bad for you.  This is all before  14:10:45
6     he makes this decision.  No nicotine, no withdrawal, 14:10:48
7     he knows the risk.  He's telling other people about  14:10:51
8     the risks.  And he's 34 years old.                   14:10:53
9          You heard a lot of evidence about teenage       14:10:58
10     brains and allegations about marketing to young      14:11:01
11     people.  He's not a young person.  He doesn't have a 14:11:04
12     teenage brain at age -- I'm sorry, 34.  He's a grown 14:11:07
13     man.  He's been in the Air Force.  He's got a wife   14:11:12
14     and a family and a job and a rising, promising       14:11:16
15     career. 14:11:19
16          So what does he do with knowledge of the risks, 14:11:20
17     no nicotine in his system, no withdrawal and an -- a 14:11:23
18     personalized concern about what smoking might be     14:11:28
19     doing to himself?  He goes back to smoking.          14:11:31
20          Now, there was a lot of argument here about     14:11:34
21     character, and I don't want there to be any          14:11:39
22     suggestion that I or Ms. Gallagher or anyone else is 14:11:41
23     criticizing Mr. Ramsay.  We are not.  We haven't     14:11:43
24     sued anybody. 14:11:47
25          There are lots of people who make the choice to 14:11:49

1     smoke, who have no nicotine in their system, who     14:11:52
2     aren't addicted, have no withdrawal and who are old  14:11:55
3     enough to make that decision, as Mr. Ramsay was when 14:11:58
4     he did this. 14:12:00
5          So the question that you should be asking       14:12:02
6     yourself is:  What would Mr. Ramsay have done if it  14:12:05
7     wasn't the nicotine, if it wasn't the withdrawal, if 14:12:08
8     it wasn't a teenage brain, if it wasn't ignorance of 14:12:11
9     the risk? 14:12:14
10          He made the same type of adult informed         14:12:15
11     decision that millions of people did then and do     14:12:18
12     now.  And he chose, instead of going the route of    14:12:22
13     being a nonsmoker, to going back to being a smoker.  14:12:26
14          Now, Mr. Berg said to you that while he had     14:12:29
15     stopped smoking, he went back to smoking because he  14:12:33
16     couldn't stop.  Mrs. Bishop tried to tell you the    14:12:36
17     same thing in answer to one of your question.  Why   14:12:40
18     did he go back to smoking after three and a half     14:12:42
19     weeks of not smoking?                                14:12:44
20          And the answer was something like, well, he     14:12:46
21     couldn't stop.  But he had already stopped.  Whether 14:12:49
22     Mr. Ramsay wanted to or not, this wasn't about       14:12:51
23     motivation.  He was off cigarettes because of what   14:12:54
24     happened to his collapsed lung.                      14:12:57
25          What's important is that he went back to        14:12:59

1     smoking and why he went back to smoking.  And it's   14:13:02
2     not for any of the reasons that they've been talking 14:13:05
3     to you about in this trial.                          14:13:07
4          The fact of the matter is Mr. Ramsay made a     14:13:09
5     personal choice to be a smoker, and there's no       14:13:14
6     reason that he ever would have made any other choice 14:13:17
7     until in the late 1980s he decided to quit.          14:13:21
8          Now, Mr. Clark then talked to you about what    14:13:24
9     Mr. Ramsay did in the late '80s to try to quit.  And 14:13:30
10     he was right about that part of it.  Mr. Ramsay made 14:13:33
11     a plan.  He made an asserted effort.  He stopped     14:13:36
12     smoking around Mrs. Bishop.  He stopped smoking in   14:13:39
13     the house.  He stopped smoking in his office.  He    14:13:41
14     stopped smoking on the floor and in the building.    14:13:44
15     All of those things.                                 14:13:46
16          Then Mr. Clark said, well, why didn't           14:13:47
17     Mr. Ramsay do that earlier?  And he said, who knows? 14:13:51
18     That was Mr. Clark's answer to that question, who    14:13:58
19     knows.  Who knows why he didn't try earlier?  Well,  14:13:58
20     you know.  Because you saw the evidence of it.  I    14:14:01
21     want to show you some of it.                         14:14:04
22          Can I have that slide, please?                  14:14:06
23          The reason he didn't try those things earlier   14:14:12
24     is because he wasn't really interested in quitting.  14:14:14
25     Remember Mike Criscitiello?  He was his coworker who 14:14:16

1     had been through the process of quitting smoking.    14:14:21
2     And he said to Mr. Ramsay, if I can quit, you can    14:14:21
3     quit. 14:14:24
4          Mr. Ramsay didn't say back to him, oh, I don't  14:14:26
5     believe that.  There's a controversy.  The tobacco   14:14:29
6     companies are telling me to doubt all of this.  He   14:14:32
7     just stared at him.                                  14:14:35
8          When his daughter, Jennifer Hardman, said to    14:14:37
9     him smoking is not good for you, he didn't say back  14:14:40
10     to her, I don't believe that.  The tobacco companies 14:14:43
11     are telling me it's safe.  He said, I know.          14:14:44
12          When Mrs. Bishop was telling him smoking is     14:14:48
13     killing you, I wish you would stop smoking, he just  14:14:50
14     puffed away.  He wasn't interested in quitting       14:14:53
15     smoking. 14:14:56
16          Can I have the next one?                        14:14:57
17          That's what he was saying.  What was he doing?  14:15:00
18     Did he really try to quit?                           14:15:04
19          Mr. Criscitiello, once again, he knew what it   14:15:06
20     took to quit smoking because he did it.  And         14:15:09
21     Mr. Fiorta asked him, well, you saw him, what was he 14:15:11
22     doing?  Was he really interested in quitting?  And   14:15:14
23     he told you no.  He really probably wasn't serious   14:15:16
24     about really wanting to quit smoking.                14:15:19
25          His daughter admitted he could have tried       14:15:21

1     earlier and more often.  And even Mrs. Bishop, who   14:15:23
2     is asking you for money in this case, said he could  14:15:28
3     have made additional efforts or attempts to quit.    14:15:30
4          He was not at a point in his life before 1988   14:15:33
5     where he was ready and committed to quitting.  And   14:15:38
6     then in 1988, think about this.  What really         14:15:40
7     changed?  The argument was made that if only he had  14:15:44
8     known something else in 1974.  If only the doctor    14:15:48
9     had said to him, you know, your collapsed lung was   14:15:52
10     because of the smoking.  You need to quit.           14:15:56
11          In 1988 he didn't have new information.  He     14:15:58
12     didn't read some study that led -- that suddenly     14:16:01
13     made him think it's true.  I've been saying it's     14:16:04
14     true all these years, but now I believe it's true.   14:16:06
15     That's not what happened.                            14:16:08
16          What happened in 1988, if you remember,         14:16:10
17     Mr. Ramsay had a grandchild.  And he wanted to be    14:16:12
18     there for his grandchild's graduation from college,  14:16:16
19     and now he had a motivation that he didn't have      14:16:20
20     before. 14:16:22
21          Mr. Berg tried to tell you that this fork in    14:16:23
22     the road that Mr. Ramsay had in 1974 was because he  14:16:26
23     didn't know the risks.  That's not it.  He did know  14:16:30
24     the risks.  What he didn't have was the motivation   14:16:32
25     to remain a nonsmoker, even though he knew that      14:16:35

1     information. 14:16:39
2          So then the question becomes from the verdict   14:16:40
3     form, if you take away nicotine addiction, would he  14:16:43
4     still have gotten sick?  Well, what do we know?  We  14:16:47
5     know what the effect of Mr. Ramsay's personal choice 14:16:50
6     was.  It's what Dr. Villa told you about that I just 14:16:53
7     went up there and sat down in his seat.              14:16:56
8          If he had -- if Mr. Ramsay had made a different 14:16:59
9     choice in 1974, more likely than not, he wouldn't    14:17:01
10     have gotten lung cancer.  That was not a choice that 14:17:05
11     Reynolds or Philip Morris or any tobacco company     14:17:08
12     could make for Mr. Ramsay.                           14:17:10
13          As Dr. Hurt said -- and we'll see the slide --  14:17:14
14     only the smoker can decide when to quit smoking.     14:17:17
15          All right.  Let's go back to the verdict form.  14:17:24
16     No, no.  Back one.  Back.                            14:17:29
17          The answer to question No. 1 should be no.  The 14:17:32
18     answer should be no.  Because their allegation that  14:17:38
19     addiction is a substantial and continuous reason why 14:17:41
20     Mr. Ramsay smoked enough to get lung cancer just     14:17:45
21     doesn't hold up.                                     14:17:47
22          Take away the nicotine, take away the           14:17:48
23     addiction, take away all of that, Mr. Ramsay still   14:17:51
24     is choosing to smoke.                                14:17:54
25          Now, you'll see on the verdict form that if you 14:17:56

1     answer no to question No. 1, your work is actually   14:18:03
2     done.  You don't have to go through the rest of the  14:18:07
3     verdict form.  And that's why both of us have spent  14:18:09
4     so much time on this first question, and I think why 14:18:11
5     both of us have spent so much time on the decision   14:18:14
6     that adult Mr. Ramsay made in 1974.                  14:18:17
7          But it is my job to talk to you about the rest  14:18:20
8     of the verdict form, and you heard a lot of evidence 14:18:23
9     about the other issues too.  So I want to talk to    14:18:25
10     you about some of the other questions now.           14:18:27
11          Can I have the next question?                   14:18:29
12          Was smoking cigarettes manufactured by each     14:18:31
13     defendant a legal cause of Robert Ramsay's lung      14:18:34
14     cancer and death?                                    14:18:36
15          Now, this is an interesting question because in 14:18:37
16     this case you heard about some of the brands and you 14:18:41
17     have to answer this question for each company.  So   14:18:44
18     you heard in this case about some of the brands that 14:18:47
19     were made by Reynolds, like Winston and Vantage.     14:18:49
20     And some of the brands that were made by Philip      14:18:54
21     Morris.  You heard some evidence that he smoked      14:18:56
22     those brands.  But you also heard that those weren't 14:18:58
23     the only brands that Mr. Ramsay smoked.              14:19:00
24          And the evidence was far from clear about what  14:19:03
25     the other brands were, how much he smoked, and for   14:19:06

1     how long he smoked them.                             14:19:09
2          You might remember when Mrs. Bishop was on the  14:19:12
3     stand, she told you, well, I was never really a      14:19:14
4     smoker so I can't really tell you exactly what       14:19:17
5     brands he was smoking.  I can't really tell you      14:19:20
6     exactly how much he was smoking.  When I first met   14:19:22
7     him, he only smoked on weekends.  I really don't     14:19:26
8     know how much he smoked.  And then even after we     14:19:28
9     were married, he always bought his own cigarettes.   14:19:31
10     I don't really know how much he smoked.              14:19:32
11          Plaintiffs have given you some medical records  14:19:35
12     that say in total, he smoked this amount or that     14:19:37
13     amount, but you have no evidence about how much of   14:19:40
14     Reynolds smoking he did and when.  And the same for  14:19:44
15     Philip Morris. 14:19:48
16          Even when one of you asked Mrs. Bishop the      14:19:48
17     question about what brands she bought him, like when 14:19:53
18     he was on vacation and he quit for -- or he sort of  14:19:57
19     stopped for a couple of days and she'd buy him       14:20:00
20     cigarettes, and one of you asked her, well, what     14:20:03
21     about these cigarettes that you bought then?  What   14:20:05
22     did you buy?  She said, well, maybe Vantage, maybe   14:20:07
23     Merit.  And I stood up and I said, now, are you      14:20:11
24     really sure those are the ones that you bought?  And 14:20:13
25     she said, I'm not sure.  I'm really just guessing.   14:20:16

1          There's really no hardcore evidence about how   14:20:18
2     much he was smoking of these brands.  If we look at  14:20:23
3     her interrogatory responses, the questions she       14:20:27
4     answered before trial where she swore under oath     14:20:27
5     that her answers were true, and it was all over the  14:20:29
6     map.  It was like 20 different brands.  And for      14:20:32
7     Vantage and Merit it just said like various times.   14:20:35
8     Merit, various times.                                14:20:38
9          The evidence in this case just isn't clear      14:20:43
10     about how much of Reynolds' brands or Philip Morris' 14:20:45
11     brands he smoked.  And when Dr. Villa took the       14:20:48
12     stand, he was never even asked.  Nobody asked        14:20:50
13     Dr. Villa.  It's their burden of proof.  They didn't 14:20:55
14     ask Dr. Villa, if you take away the R.J. Reynolds    14:20:57
15     smoking, would Mr. Ramsay have gotten ill?           14:21:02
16          You never heard the answer to that question.    14:21:06
17     You never heard the same question for Philip Morris. 14:21:09
18     What he said was, the total amount of smoking all    14:21:12
19     brands for all times, according to Dr. Villa, caused 14:21:16
20     the lung cancer.  That doesn't allow you to answer   14:21:19
21     this question on the verdict form.                   14:21:22
22          So we would ask if you even reach this          14:21:26
23     question, that you find that the plaintiff has not   14:21:33
24     met her burden of proof and that no be checked for   14:21:36
25     both defendants.                                     14:21:39

1          Okay.  Let's go to the next questions.  And I'm 14:21:41
2     going to take a few of these at the same time        14:21:43
3     because there's some similar issues on these.        14:21:45
4          Again, you can see that Mr. Ramsay is in every  14:21:47
5     question, and what's being asked here is "please     14:21:51
6     state whether Mr. Ramsay reasonably relied to his    14:21:53
7     detriment on any statement by R.J. Reynolds that     14:21:56
8     concealed or omitted material information concerning 14:22:01
9     the health effects and/or addictive nature of        14:22:02
10     smoking cigarettes, and if so, whether such reliance 14:22:05
11     was a legal cause of his death."                     14:22:08
12          There are a couple of things I think you can    14:22:11
13     focus on that will make your job on this question a  14:22:14
14     lot easier.  There are two parts in each question.   14:22:17
15     Reasonably relied to his detriment in a statement by 14:22:21
16     R.J. Reynolds or a statement by Philip Morris.       14:22:24
17          In fact, can we have the next?                  14:22:26
18          You'll see that questions 5 and 6 on the        14:22:29
19     verdict form are very similar, the same              14:22:32
20     requirements.  Reasonably relied to his detriment    14:22:35
21     and a statement made in furtherance of Reynolds or   14:22:37
22     Philip Morris U.S.A.'s agreement.                    14:22:40
23          What does all of that boil down to?  Two        14:22:43
24     questions.  For every statement that they're saying  14:22:45
25     that we should be held liable for, you should be     14:22:48

1     asking yourselves two questions.  Who said it?  Who  14:22:51
2     made the statement?  And did Mr. Ramsay rely on that 14:22:55
3     statement?  14:22:59
4          And I want to start with the first question of  14:23:00
5     who said it, because you saw many, many statements   14:23:03
6     in this trial made by all sorts of different people. 14:23:07
7     You saw statements by newscasters.  You saw          14:23:11
8     statements made by government officials like the     14:23:14
9     Surgeon General.  You saw statements about smoking   14:23:16
10     made by public -- people in the public health        14:23:19
11     community like Cuyler Hammond at the American Cancer 14:23:22
12     Society and others.                                  14:23:26
13          You saw some statements made by tobacco company 14:23:27
14     employees.  And we're going to talk about those.     14:23:30
15     And you saw some statements that were made on behalf 14:23:32
16     of groups representing the tobacco companies.        14:23:35
17          So these questions that say statement by        14:23:38
18     Reynolds, statement by PM, they're going to require  14:23:41
19     you to think about whatever their allegations of     14:23:44
20     fraud are, who said it?  Who actually said it?  And  14:23:47
21     I want to give you an example of why that's          14:23:51
22     important.  14:23:53
23          Mr. Clark said during his closing, he said a    14:23:54
24     couple of times RJR and PM put out there that the    14:23:58
25     filters were safer.  He said we were out in the      14:24:03

1     public saying that filters were safer.               14:24:06
2          That's -- that's an example of where it's going 14:24:09
3     to be really important for you to look at whether or 14:24:11
4     not we actually said that.  It seems simple.         14:24:15
5          Um, first off, it's possible because they have  14:24:18
6     this argument that Mr. Ramsay thought that low-tar,  14:24:25
7     low-nicotine cigarettes were safer.  Maybe he did    14:24:27
8     think that.  Maybe he did.                           14:24:31
9          But the question that you have to answer for    14:24:33
10     yourselves is did he think that because of something 14:24:36
11     that we said?  Because of something that he heard    14:24:37
12     that was in furtherance of a conspiracy or that we   14:24:41
13     said.  And you're going to see that's just not the   14:24:44
14     case. 14:24:47
15          I want to show you some examples of what they   14:24:48
16     put in evidence.  We're into their fraud case now.   14:24:51
17     Remember Mr. Clark said we put out there that        14:24:54
18     filters were safer.  Let's look at what they         14:24:57
19     actually put in.                                     14:25:01
20          Can I have the next one?                        14:25:01
21          These are some of the ads, and I went through   14:25:03
22     each and every one of these ads with Dr. Cummings, I 14:25:05
23     think.  And he agreed with me that there's not a     14:25:07
24     single one of these ads that says anything about     14:25:11
25     filters or low-tar cigarettes being safer.           14:25:14

1          You won't find safe.  You won't find safer.     14:25:18
2     You won't find less hazardous.  You won't find less  14:25:20
3     harmful.  You won't find any of that.                14:25:24
4          And even after Dr. Cummings got off the stand,  14:25:26
5     plaintiffs came back and they put in a few more      14:25:28
6     stacks of ads.  There's a big stack of ads in there  14:25:31
7     that they put in there.  Look through as many of     14:25:34
8     them as you want.  You will not find safe, safer,    14:25:36
9     less harmful, or anything like that in there.        14:25:39
10          Mr. Clark argued that we put out there that     14:25:43
11     the -- that filtered and low-tar cigarettes were     14:25:46
12     safer.  That's a great argument.  Except for the     14:25:48
13     fact that it doesn't square with the facts.  It      14:25:51
14     doesn't square with the evidence.  Then they showed  14:25:55
15     you some commercials.                                14:25:57
16          Actually, let me see the next dem first,        14:25:58
17     please. 14:26:01
18          These were the Vantage and Merit ads.  I went   14:26:01
19     through all six of these.  Nothing in there about    14:26:05
20     safe or safer.  It's all about flavor and taste.     14:26:07
21          Then they show a commercial for Vantage.  Do we 14:26:11
22     have that?  Listen for it and see if you hear        14:26:14
23     anything about safe or safer.                        14:26:18

2          MALE SPEAKER:  Until now, many smokers have     14:26:28
3     found that high-flavor cigarettes have been high-tar 14:26:30
4     cigarettes.  Until now, as cigarette tar went down,  14:26:35
5     cigarette taste went down.                           14:26:37
6          Until now, the flavor stopped here.             14:26:38
7          But now there's Vantage.  The full flavor       14:26:42
8     breakthrough cigarette with the incredible new       14:26:45
9     filter that doesn't cop-out on flavor.               14:26:47
10          Vantage, it's on the way and it's worth waiting 14:26:50
11     for.  14:26:54

14          MR. WALKER:  Now, looking at who said it, the   14:26:56
15     companies are saying flavor, taste.  If you want     14:26:59
16     flavor, if you want taste, here's our brands.        14:27:02
17     They're low-tar, low-nicotine brands with flavor.    14:27:05
18     Here they are. 14:27:08
19          There were people out there saying that         14:27:09
20     low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes were safer.  It     14:27:11
21     just wasn't us.  The public health community, people 14:27:14
22     that Dr. Cummings and all of the witnesses said, no, 14:27:17
23     they're not in any conspiracy with the tobacco       14:27:23
24     companies.  Cuyler Hammond at the American Cancer    14:27:25
25     Society, they weren't part of any conspiracy with    14:27:27

1     Reynolds or Philip Morris.  They didn't work for     14:27:30
2     Philip Morris or Reynolds.                           14:27:32
3          Let's look at what they were telling the public 14:27:34
4     about filters and low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes.  14:27:35
5          Can I have the next dem?                        14:27:38
6          This is the American Cancer Society.  Not       14:27:40
7     Reynolds, not Philip Morris, not any alleged         14:27:44
8     coconspirator.  If you do smoke cigarettes, you      14:27:48
9     should know the relative amounts of nicotine and tar 14:27:50
10     in your cigarettes as determined by the Federal      14:27:51
11     Trade Commission.                                    14:27:54
12          The less tar and nicotine you inhale, the       14:27:55
13     better. 14:27:59
14          Was the message out there?  Yes.  Were we the   14:28:00
15     ones putting it out there like Mr. Clark said we     14:28:03
16     were?  Absolutely not.                               14:28:06
17          Can I have the next one, please?                14:28:07
18          This is the U.S. Department of Health,          14:28:09
19     Education, and Welfare, a pamphlet:  "How to Take    14:28:13
20     Some of the Danger Out of Smoking."                  14:28:16
21          "Choose a cigarette with less tar and nicotine. 14:28:17
22     The difference between brands can be more than two   14:28:20
23     to one."  If Mr. Ramsay thought that low-tar and     14:28:22
24     low-nicotine cigarettes were safer, what's more      14:28:27
25     likely?  That he got that from our ads talking about 14:28:30

1     taste and flavor or that he got it from pamphlets    14:28:33
2     and other information from the public health         14:28:37
3     community like this that expressly said, "Choose a   14:28:39
4     cigarette with less tar and less nicotine."          14:28:42
5          And then there were the public service          14:28:45
6     announcements that Mrs. Bishop said she knows were   14:28:47
7     being run.  She saw some of them.                    14:28:50
8          Can we have that?  Just one example.            14:28:52
9          (On video.)                                     14:28:54
10          MALE SPEAKER:  We have a little wisdom for      14:28:56
11     smokers.  Starting at the bitter end.  The first     14:28:58
12     puffs are not enough, but those last are the         14:29:03
13     deadliest of all.  (Inaudible) you smoke are the     14:29:08
14     tars and nicotine and the (inaudible).  A big rotten 14:29:08
15     accumulation, and you can actually end up            14:29:14
16     (inaudible). 14:29:16
17          The more tar and nicotine you start off with,   14:29:18
18     the more you end up with.  And you can buy yourself  14:29:20
19     118 different packs of trouble.  Up to 31 milligrams 14:29:25
20     of tar; up to 2.2 milligrams of nicotine.  There is  14:29:29
21     no such thing as a harmless cigarette.               14:29:34
22          But the low-tar/nicotine cigarette can save you 14:29:37
23     a little.  And if you're still smoking, that's       14:29:41
24     better than nothing.  We've got a tar/nicotine       14:29:44
25     (inaudible).  It's free (inaudible) right now."      14:29:48

3          MR. WALKER:  That's the United States Public    14:29:54
4     Health Service.  It's not a commercial for Vantage   14:29:57
5     or a commercial for Merit or anything at all put out 14:29:59
6     by a tobacco company.                                14:30:01
7          It's easy to attack cigarette companies.  It's  14:30:03
8     easy to do that.  But they shouldn't be attacked for 14:30:08
9     statements they didn't make.                         14:30:12
10          The next question, then, is once you've gotten  14:30:15
11     past who actually made the statements, then you've   14:30:20
12     got to think about --                                14:30:22
13          Can I have the next dem?                        14:30:23
14          -- whether Mr. Ramsay relied, and there are a   14:30:26
15     couple of things I want to go over with you on this. 14:30:29
16          First of all, when you start to think about     14:30:32
17     whether Mr. Ramsay relied, consider the testimony    14:30:34
18     that you heard from Mrs. Bishop and others that      14:30:37
19     Mr. Ramsay never talked about ads, advertisements.   14:30:40
20     We heard today, and we heard while she was on the    14:30:44
21     witness stand, they talked about everything, but     14:30:48
22     they didn't talk about ads.                          14:30:50
23          No one heard Mr. -- Mrs. Bishop and no one else 14:30:52
24     ever heard Mr. Ramsay say that a tobacco company     14:30:56
25     said that smoking Vantage would help him quit.       14:31:00

1          But Mrs. Bishop did say that she heard public   14:31:04
2     service announcements like the one we just saw from  14:31:08
3     Health, Education, and Welfare talking about low-tar 14:31:12
4     and low-nicotine cigarettes.  She did say that she   14:31:15
5     heard public service announcements from the American 14:31:17
6     Cancer Society talking about low-tar and             14:31:20
7     low-nicotine cigarettes.                             14:31:25
8          The bottom line is this.  A couple of things:   14:31:25
9     Company statements, they showed you a lot of company 14:31:35
10     statements; advertisements; and then they made these 14:31:38
11     arguments about youth market.                        14:31:41
12          Let's start with company statements.  First of  14:31:42
13     all, Dr. Cummings admitted that there was no         14:31:45
14     statement in the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s that         14:31:48
15     nicotine was not addictive.  There's no evidence in  14:31:51
16     this case that Mr. Ramsay saw, believed, or relied   14:31:55
17     on any industry statements.  You've heard and you'll 14:31:58
18     continue to hear about this wallpaper effect --      14:32:01
19     wallpaper, it's all over the place.                  14:32:04
20          But remember when I asked Mrs. Bishop when she  14:32:05
21     was on the stand, "You're about the same age as      14:32:08
22     Mr. Ramsay.  You grew up in the same community.  Did 14:32:10
23     you ever hear any of this stuff about the Frank      14:32:13
24     Statement or the Tobacco Industry Research Committee 14:32:16
25     or all these ads?                                    14:32:18

1          "No.  No, I didn't."                            14:32:19
2          Mr. Ramsay never mentioned any tobacco company  14:32:21
3     organizations, and Mrs. Bishop had never even heard  14:32:24
4     of them. 14:32:26
5          Now, the statements that they showed you from   14:32:28
6     tobacco company employees, they were all to the      14:32:32
7     effect that it wasn't proven that smoking causes     14:32:36
8     disease.  They talked about those.  They showed you  14:32:39
9     statements about how, you know, the companies, they  14:32:41
10     say, were trying to create doubt.  It wasn't proven. 14:32:44
11     There's a controversy.  There's an open debate.      14:32:46
12          But Mr. Ramsay never said those things to       14:32:49
13     anyone.  Mr. Ramsay -- if Mr. Ramsay was relying on  14:32:51
14     statements from the companies that the risks weren't 14:32:55
15     proven, why is he telling people, "I know the        14:32:57
16     risks"?  If he relied on statements about it not     14:33:00
17     being injurious to health, why is he telling his     14:33:03
18     daughter and his son that they shouldn't smoke?      14:33:06
19          It's a great argument; it just doesn't make any 14:33:09
20     sense for the facts of this case.                    14:33:12
21          The evidence was to the contrary.  The evidence 14:33:14
22     wasn't that Mr. Ramsay doubted the risk or thought   14:33:17
23     that there was some controversy about it.  It was    14:33:20
24     the exact opposite.                                  14:33:22
25          Can we have the next -- or -- oh, I see.  Go    14:33:24

1     back.  You had it.                                   14:33:27
2          The evidence was that Mr. Ramsay did know.  He  14:33:28
3     was warned by his family.  He saw it on the news.    14:33:31
4     He watched Walter Cronkite.  He read the paper in    14:33:33
5     the morning, in the evening, and on the weekends.    14:33:39
6          We showed you what was in the periodicals that  14:33:42
7     he looked at.  This was all the way back in 1957     14:33:44
8     talking about higher death rates for cigarette       14:33:47
9     smokers. 14:33:49
10          The next one, please.                           14:33:49
11          This is the same quote we looked at earlier     14:33:50
12     from public health officials.  Mr. Ramsay knew.      14:33:52
13          The next one.                                   14:33:56
14          This is another one from the National Cancer    14:33:57
15     Institute.  Newspapers, radio, TV, and other media   14:34:00
16     have done an excellent job covering this problem and 14:34:03
17     a very objective job.  This is an exceedingly        14:34:06
18     valuable way of informing the public.                14:34:08
19          Next one, please.                               14:34:10
20          We talked about all the magazine coverage of    14:34:11
21     it.   14:34:14
22          Next one. 14:34:14
23          And the Surgeon General's Report and so on and  14:34:15
24     so on. 14:34:19
25          And we know that from 1966 forward, there was a 14:34:19

1     warning or a caution label about the health risks of 14:34:30
2     cigarette smoking on every single package of         14:34:34
3     cigarettes that Mr. Ramsay smoked.                   14:34:35
4          No one ever heard Mr. Ramsay repeat any of the  14:34:38
5     things that they say the companies were saying on    14:34:41
6     television or anyplace else.  Then something         14:34:44
7     interesting happened -- and I hope you all caught    14:34:47
8     this.  This was on Dr. Cummings's cross-examination, 14:35:18
9     and we went back and forth on a great number of      14:34:51
10     things. 14:34:53
11          But I asked Dr. Cummings if he had seen the     14:34:54
12     polling data where Americans were actually asked     14:34:57
13     whether they were even listening to the tobacco      14:35:00
14     companies at all.                                    14:35:03
15          And this is what you learned when we saw that.  14:35:04
16          Can I have the next one?  That is not it.       14:35:06
17     Okay -- no.  There we go.                            14:35:12
18          This is one of the examples of the Roper polls  14:35:19
19     that we saw, where Americans were asked, like in     14:35:21
20     1968, "Who are the most reliable sources of          14:35:24
21     information on smoking and health?"  This is a place 14:35:26
22     where, if the tobacco companies were duping the      14:35:29
23     American public, if everybody was listening and      14:35:32
24     relying on things that tobacco companies were saying 14:35:35
25     on TV like this Bill Dwyer he talked about, you      14:35:37

1     should see a high percentage of people listing the   14:35:40
2     tobacco companies as a reliable source of            14:35:44
3     information.  Instead, only 5 percent listed the     14:35:45
4     tobacco companies as a reliable source.              14:35:51
5          Can I have the next slide?                      14:35:52
6          60 percent thought that the public health       14:35:54
7     community, the warnings that we showed you, where    14:35:59
8     Dr. Hammond said people should be warned and they    14:36:01
9     are being warned about the cigarettes risk,          14:36:04
10     Dr. Graham's coverage of the mouse-painting studies  14:36:06
11     that he did, people were listening to that           14:36:09
12     information about the health risks of cigarette      14:36:12
13     smoking. 14:36:14
14          Can I have the next one?                        14:36:14
15          But these are all the statements that           14:36:16
16     plaintiffs showed you in their case.  Anne Browder,  14:36:19
17     Mr. Bowling, Mr. Cullman, Mr. Heimann, Mr. Corrigan, 14:36:22
18     they showed you all these statements by company      14:36:27
19     employees in videos, and they wanted you to think    14:36:30
20     that these people were somehow pulling the wool over 14:36:31
21     the eyes of the American people.                     14:36:34
22          This survey from 1968 and all the surveys we    14:36:36
23     talked about during the case that came after it show 14:36:41
24     that's just not true.                                14:36:44
25          The American public did not think that these    14:36:45

1     tobacco company employees and representatives were   14:36:48
2     reliable.  People weren't relying on what they said, 14:36:52
3     and neither was Mr. Ramsay.                          14:36:55
4          In fact -- can we have the next one, please?    14:36:56
5          This is how bad it was as of 1962.  This is,    14:36:59
6     like, 50 years ago or more.  This is a "Reader's     14:37:05
7     Digest" article where the person who wrote the       14:37:09
8     article is saying, "Tobacco industry spokesman       14:37:11
9     issued the standard rejoinder that the evidence was  14:37:15
10     merely old data without new research findings, but   14:37:17
11     the statements sounded weaker and more pathetic than 14:37:21
12     ever." 14:37:24
13          What did they show you?  They showed you an     14:37:25
14     internal document where somebody at the Tobacco      14:37:28
15     Institute was patting themselves on the back about   14:37:31
16     how they had this great idea that was brilliantly    14:37:34
17     conceived.  This is great.  You've got the hard data 14:37:36
18     in these surveys that shows that people just weren't 14:37:40
19     listening to the tobacco companies, and there's no   14:37:43
20     reason to believe that Mr. Ramsay was any different. 14:37:45
21     He did not rely.                                     14:37:48
22          Then they talk about advertising.  Well, we've  14:37:50
23     already seen --                                      14:37:54
24          Can I have the next dem?                        14:37:55
25          We already saw what the theme was in the        14:37:57

1     advertising.  The ads were about flavor and taste    14:37:59
2     and draw, how it feels when you're smoking the       14:38:01
3     cigarettes, and some of the -- some of the ads       14:38:04
4     actually acknowledge the reports about the health    14:38:06
5     risks of cigarette smoking.                          14:38:08
6          It was the public health community that was     14:38:10
7     talking about how you should quit.  If you don't     14:38:12
8     quit, you should lower your tar.  It still isn't     14:38:15
9     safe because all cigarettes including low-tar and    14:38:19
10     low-nicotine cigarettes can cause lung cancer.       14:38:23
11          Plaintiff says that you should infer, that you  14:38:25
12     should infer that Mr. Ramsay relied on things like   14:38:30
13     the Beverly Hillbillies, the Flintstones, Lord knows 14:38:33
14     what else.  But infer that based upon what?          14:38:37
15          Maybe there's some other case.  Maybe one of    14:38:41
16     those other 80 cases where Dr. Cummings testified,   14:38:44
17     maybe there's some other plaintiff in this Engle     14:38:47
18     class you keep hearing about relied on that stuff,   14:38:50
19     just not Mr. Ramsay.  There's no evidence of that in 14:38:53
20     this case.  14:38:55
21          And the last thing I want to just mention,      14:38:56
22     there have been some allegations about youth         14:38:59
23     marketing.  14:39:01
24          This idea, in fact, I think Mr. Clark started   14:39:02
25     off with it.  Very serious allegations that the      14:39:05

1     companies were out trying to hook children.          14:39:07
2          And they put in -- they had a list of a bunch   14:39:11
3     of documents that supposedly show you that.  If you  14:39:14
4     were to actually look at those documents, you're     14:39:17
5     going to find that the very first document they      14:39:19
6     listed was from about 15 years before Mr. Ramsay was 14:39:21
7     born.  Sometime back in the -- maybe Calvin Coolidge 14:39:24
8     was president, sometime in the '30s or '20s.  Maybe  14:39:29
9     it was in the '20s.  Nothing to do with Mr. Ramsay.  14:39:32
10          Then they've got a bunch of documents like from 14:39:35
11     the '50s where surveys are just being conducted to   14:39:37
12     find out who's smoking.  "Are you smoking?  Are you  14:39:40
13     not smoking?" 14:39:43
14          Then they've got a bunch of documents from the  14:39:44
15     '70s and the '80s -- Mr. Ramsay, like, in his 30s    14:39:45
16     and in his 40s, a grown adult -- that are proposing  14:39:49
17     new marketing plans for the future.  You will see it 14:39:54
18     in the title.  New -- proposal for new brands,       14:39:57
19     proposal for new marketing.                          14:40:00
20          And even those documents, those were some of    14:40:02
21     the documents we had to come back and say, "Wait.    14:40:06
22     You're -- you cut out the part of it that says what  14:40:08
23     Reynolds' policy actually was."                      14:40:12
24          Can I have the next one?                        14:40:13
25          This is what got cut out in their documents.    14:40:16

1     1973.  This one, we -- we made them show it to you   14:40:19
2     even while their witness was on the stand.  "We      14:40:24
3     should not in any way influence nonsmokers to        14:40:26
4     start." 14:40:29
5          1975.  "These terms do not accurately describe  14:40:29
6     what we are talking about."  This is the one that    14:40:32
7     was introduced to suggest that somehow young adult   14:40:34
8     smoker means something other than young adult        14:40:39
9     smoker.  This document shows that even before they   14:40:41
10     were putting adult in the paper, what they meant was 14:40:45
11     adults.  Young adult smoker.                         14:40:48
12          In 1975 -- this was another document they       14:40:52
13     showed you.  And -- and it talks about the target    14:40:55
14     market.  Remember Dr. Cummings said, "Oh, you're     14:40:58
15     targeting people under 18."                          14:41:01
16          I said, "Well, Dr. Cummings, wait a minute.  It 14:41:02
17     says right here 'primary target 18 to 34.'"          14:41:03
18          And then the last one.  This was the one I told 14:41:06
19     you about in openings.  And even though I told you   14:41:09
20     in openings they were going to show you this         14:41:12
21     document and not show you this part, they still show 14:41:15
22     you the document without showing you this part.  You 14:41:18
23     saw this document today without this part.           14:41:20
24          And what was being missing -- what was missing? 14:41:22
25     RJR's consistent policy is that smoking is a matter  14:41:25

1     of free informed adult choice which the company does 14:41:28
2     not seek to influence.  This report is intended to   14:41:33
3     provide additional learning on younger adult smokers 14:41:36
4     age 18 to 24. 14:41:39
5          What does all of that have to do with Ramsay?   14:41:41
6     Nothing.  It has absolutely nothing to do with him.  14:41:44
7     None of those documents relates to Mr. Ramsay at     14:41:48
8     all.  14:41:51
9          And the answer to the questions on the verdict  14:41:51
10     form -- 14:41:54
11          Do we have that?                                14:41:55
12          For all of the reasons that I just went over    14:41:56
13     with you:  -- who said it, did Mr. Ramsay rely, does 14:41:58
14     it have anything to do with Mr. Ramsay -- for all of 14:42:02
15     those reasons the answers to questions 3, 4, 5, and  14:42:04
16     6 should be no.                                      14:42:08
17          Can I have the next one?                        14:42:10
18          All right.  The answer to these should be no as 14:42:13
19     well. 14:42:19
20          Now, the next question on the verdict form.     14:42:19
21     "State the percentage of any fault that was a legal  14:42:21
22     cause of Robert Ramsay's death that you charge       14:42:24
23     to" -- and there are places where you can put a      14:42:27
24     percentage for each of those.  The important part    14:42:30
25     is, if you notice in the question like all the other 14:42:32

1     questions, there's another reference to Robert       14:42:34
2     Ramsay.  The only percentages that you can put down  14:42:37
3     here are things that were a legal cause of injury to 14:42:40
4     Robert Ramsay. 14:42:44
5          If there's some choice, some decision, some     14:42:46
6     conduct that you hear about -- and I'm sure after I  14:42:48
7     sit down and they have another chance, they'll take  14:42:51
8     another run at it -- you've got to ask yourselves    14:42:53
9     whether it has something to do with Robert Ramsay.   14:42:56
10     Would it have mattered to him?                       14:42:58
11          What are the choices that actually could have   14:43:00
12     made a difference to Mr. Ramsay?                     14:43:03
13          The choice to quit, the choice of when to quit, 14:43:05
14     the choice of how to quit, and the choice of how     14:43:10
15     hard to try to quit.                                 14:43:14
16          And we already know --                          14:43:16
17          Can I have the next one?                        14:43:19
18          -- that the plaintiffs have admitted in this    14:43:20
19     case that the acts or omissions of Robert Ramsay     14:43:23
20     were a partial legal cause.  Well, which acts or     14:43:25
21     omissions?  14:43:25
22          Relating to the frequency and duration of his   14:43:30
23     efforts to quit.  What did you hear about the        14:43:32
24     frequency of his efforts to quit?                    14:43:35
25          Once or twice a year, on vacation.              14:43:37

1          What did you hear about the duration of his     14:43:41
2     efforts to quit?  A couple of days.                  14:43:43
3          Until the end, when he made the effort to       14:43:45
4     quit -- and you have Dr. Villa's testimony that if   14:43:49
5     he had stopped in the '60 or '70s, he wouldn't have  14:43:52
6     gotten ill. 14:43:56
7          The fact of the matter is the choices that      14:43:56
8     could actually have mattered to Mr. Ramsay and his   14:43:59
9     health could only have been made by Mr. Ramsay.      14:44:03
10     Mr. Ramsay is 100 percent responsible for each of    14:44:07
11     the choices that we just went through.               14:44:10
12          In fact, even if we look at what their paid     14:44:12
13     experts said about this -- look what Dr. Hurt said   14:44:16
14     in his pamphlet.  "Only you can decide when to quit  14:44:19
15     smoking."  If that's true, how can Reynolds be 40    14:44:23
16     percent responsible for a decision that only         14:44:27
17     Mr. Ramsay could have made?                          14:44:30
18          What did Dr. Cummings say?  He didn't admit it  14:44:32
19     to me at first.  I had to go dig out of his          14:44:35
20     testimony from all those boxes we had back there.    14:44:38
21     The smoker bears responsibility for making the       14:44:40
22     decision to try to quit.  How can Reynolds or Philip 14:44:43
23     Morris be 40 percent, 30 percent, 20 percent, even 1 14:44:47
24     percent responsible for a decision that only         14:44:51
25     Mr. Ramsay could have made?                          14:44:55

1          And, remember, Mrs. Bishop agreed with me that  14:44:59
2     Mr. Ramsay wasn't the type of person to blame other  14:45:02
3     people for his decisions and neither should you.     14:45:05
4          I'm not criticizing Mr. Ramsay.  He was         14:45:08
5     entitled to make those choices, but we shouldn't be  14:45:11
6     held responsible for them.                           14:45:14
7          The evidence was, Mr. Ramsay was very capable   14:45:16
8     of making those decisions as well.                   14:45:21
9          I'm not going to go through all of it.  You all 14:45:23
10     know by now about his career, how he applied himself 14:45:25
11     at all different levels of education and in his      14:45:29
12     work.  But you do know by now that he was the type   14:45:31
13     of man that if he had made that choice that Dr. Hurt 14:45:34
14     was talking about, that Dr. Cummings was talking     14:45:37
15     about, that Mrs. Bishop wanted him to make in 1974,  14:45:39
16     he would have accomplished in 1974 the very same     14:45:44
17     thing that he accomplished in 1988.                  14:45:47
18          What are the things that didn't matter to       14:45:50
19     Mr. Ramsay?  We've talked about some of them         14:45:55
20     already, the designs.  Dr. Villa told you.           14:45:57
21     Mr. Isasi went through that long list of designs.    14:46:00
22     Dr. Villa said, "Doesn't matter to me."  Doctors     14:46:02
23     don't ask patients, "Well, which cigarette product   14:46:05
24     are you smoking?  Does your cigarette product have   14:46:08
25     vent holes?  Does it have overwrap?  Doesn't matter. 14:46:10

1     None of that matters.                                14:46:14
2          I'm sure it was very interesting, engaging      14:46:15
3     testimony.  Does it matter for this verdict form?    14:46:17
4     Not a bit.  14:46:19
5          Dr. Hurt was asked, "Well, are any brands more  14:46:20
6     addictive than other brands?"                        14:46:27
7          He said, "No, they're all addictive."           14:46:29
8          Those same design features, everything you      14:46:30
9     heard about pH manipulation, all that doesn't make   14:46:32
10     any cigarette any more or less addictive than the    14:46:34
11     other.  That's why the warning labels that go on all 14:46:38
12     of these cigarettes, regardless of how they're       14:46:41
13     designed, all say the same thing.  "Cigarette        14:46:44
14     smoking is dangerous to your health.  Quitting now   14:46:47
15     reduces your risks."                                 14:46:50
16          Okay.  Can we go back to the dem?               14:46:52
17          So this is why we think the evidence supports   14:47:00
18     zero percent for Reynolds, zero percent for Philip   14:47:04
19     Morris, 100 percent for Mr. Ramsay.  It's not a      14:47:07
20     criticism of Mr. Ramsay; it's a recognition into     14:47:11
21     when we make choices, we bear responsibility for the 14:47:14
22     choices that we make.                                14:47:17
23          Now -- can we take that down?                   14:47:19
24          The next question on the verdict form -- I      14:47:21
25     guess the next few questions relate to damages.  And 14:47:26

1     you all know this about me because I've been saying  14:47:29
2     it since jury selection.  We don't believe this is a 14:47:32
3     case where damages should be awarded.  We just       14:47:34
4     don't.  I was upfront with you all -- with all of    14:47:37
5     you about that from the very beginning.  Quite       14:47:40
6     frankly, you shouldn't even get to the question      14:47:42
7     about damages because of the no answers that come    14:47:44
8     before that. 14:47:48
9          But I will say this:  That figure that Mr. Berg 14:47:48
10     threw out, $5 million, $5 million to the wife of a   14:47:52
11     man who made adult, informed, knowing choices to     14:47:59
12     smoke.  Where does that number come from?  It's just 14:48:03
13     pulled out of thin air, just $5 million sounded like 14:48:06
14     a round number and that's -- that was the number you 14:48:09
15     got.  There's no basis for that.  And no damages     14:48:12
16     should be awarded in this case.                      14:48:15
17          There's one last question on the verdict form   14:48:16
18     that it's my job to talk to you about, and that's    14:48:21
19     this question about punitive damages.                14:48:24
20          And I guess what I want to do first is just     14:48:26
21     talk to you a little bit about punitive damages      14:48:30
22     generally.  14:48:31
23          What are punitive damages?                      14:48:33
24          First of all, punitive damages can only be      14:48:35
25     awarded for conduct that caused Mr. Ramsay's illness 14:48:38

1     and death.  If that conduct that injured Mr. Ramsay  14:48:41
2     also injured somebody else, you can take that into   14:48:45
3     consideration under the judge's instructions.  But   14:48:47
4     you can only punish for conduct that actually harmed 14:48:49
5     Mr. Ramsay. 14:48:53
6          So, for example, Dr. Cummings, remember, showed 14:48:54
7     you a document from Claude Teague.  This is young    14:48:57
8     Claude Teague, 20 years old, second job.  In 1953 he 14:49:00
9     writes a memo that says something about changing the 14:49:05
10     color of the filters.                                14:49:07
11          Then when I asked Dr. Cummings, I said, "Hey,   14:49:09
12     did anybody ever use that?  Did that idea about      14:49:11
13     changing the colors of the filters ever get put into 14:49:14
14     a product?" 14:49:17
15          "No.  No, it didn't."                           14:49:18
16          That's an example of something that we can't be 14:49:19
17     punished for because it could not ever have hurt     14:49:21
18     Mr. Ramsay.  It was never even used in the           14:49:24
19     cigarettes.  Punitive damages can only be awarded to 14:49:27
20     Mrs. Bishop, and they are in addition to, that means 14:49:29
21     on top of, damages that fully compensate Mrs.        14:49:32
22     Bishop. 14:49:37
23          Punitive damages are simply more money.         14:49:37
24          And -- can I have the next slide?               14:49:45
25          The standard for awarding punitive damages is   14:49:48

1     much higher.  You've already heard the judge mention 14:49:51
2     in his instructions about the greater weight of the  14:49:54
3     evidence, what are -- what's going on with the --    14:49:57
4     whether the scale is being tipped.  Clear and        14:50:00
5     convincing evidence is actually the highest standard 14:50:02
6     that exists in civil law.                            14:50:04
7          It requires evidence that is more than the      14:50:07
8     greater weight of the evidence.  Evidence that is    14:50:12
9     more compelling, more persuasive, and evidence that  14:50:13
10     is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion, and of   14:50:18
11     such weight that it produces in you folks a firm     14:50:22
12     belief or conviction about the matter at issue.  And 14:50:26
13     you're just not going to see that, because what's    14:50:29
14     really being asked here is, what are we being        14:50:32
15     punished for that hurt Mr. Ramsay?                   14:50:35
16          We shouldn't be punished, for example, for      14:50:38
17     making filtered cigarettes.  The evidence in this    14:50:40
18     case was that the public health community, people    14:50:44
19     like Dr. -- I think it was Dr. Wynder or Dr. Graham  14:50:48
20     recommended that the companies make filtered         14:50:53
21     cigarettes.  We shouldn't be punished for responding 14:50:55
22     to something the health community suggested that we  14:50:59
23     do.   14:51:01
24          We shouldn't be punished for making low-tar,    14:51:02
25     low-nicotine cigarettes the public health community  14:51:05

1     also asked for that.  For years and years and years, 14:51:07
2     decades, the public health community genuinely       14:51:11
3     thought people who weren't part of anybody's         14:51:15
4     conspiracy believed that lower-tar and               14:51:17
5     lower-nicotine cigarettes would be safer for         14:51:19
6     smokers.  And we met that recommendation by selling  14:51:24
7     those cigarettes.  We shouldn't be punished for      14:51:27
8     that. 14:51:29
9          There's a suggestion that we should be punished 14:51:29
10     for nicotine manipulation; pH levels and all that.   14:51:32
11     But then, when Dr. Henningfield was here, he         14:51:35
12     admitted, again, we didn't need to call a witness    14:51:38
13     for this, Dr. Henningfield admitted that back in     14:51:40
14     those days, people thought you could make a safer    14:51:43
15     cigarette by changing the nicotine yield of          14:51:46
16     cigarettes.  And he has his own product that he      14:51:48
17     admits manipulates nicotine levels.                  14:51:52
18          It's not reprehensible conduct, it's not        14:51:58
19     punishable conduct to have an opinion that other     14:52:00
20     people had in the 1950s.                             14:52:03
21          You were shown the Frank Statement, and         14:52:06
22     Mr. Clark told you that the sentence that said there 14:52:10
23     are many possible causes of lung cancer?  He said    14:52:13
24     that that wasn't true.                               14:52:15
25          Well, Dr. Cummings said that was true at that   14:52:17

1     time. 14:52:21
2          Mr. Clark said that the sentence that said      14:52:21
3     there was no agreement among authorities regarding   14:52:24
4     the cause of lung cancer?  He said that that was a   14:52:26
5     lie.  14:52:28
6          Except that their witness, the million-dollar   14:52:29
7     man, Dr. Cummings, he said that was true at the time 14:52:32
8     that we made it.                                     14:52:35
9          And we didn't just leave it at what             14:52:36
10     Dr. Cummings said.  We actually showed you some of   14:52:38
11     the statements that people in the public health      14:52:40
12     community were making in like 1953, 1954, 1955.      14:52:42
13          The statement of Cuyler Hammond at the American 14:52:46
14     Cancer Society, the statement of Dr. Kuper           14:52:49
15     [phonetic] at the National Cancer Institute, these   14:52:51
16     were people who weren't selling cigarettes.  They    14:52:55
17     didn't -- they weren't out to try to persuade or     14:52:56
18     defraud anybody.  These were people who looked at    14:53:00
19     the same publically-available materials that young   14:53:03
20     Dr. Teague did in the library and came to a          14:53:05
21     different conclusion.                                14:53:08
22          The reality is, in the 1950s, '53, '54, '55,    14:53:10
23     when the Frank Statement came out, there were lots   14:53:14
24     of well-meaning people who -- scientists, who had    14:53:19
25     not made up their minds based on the science that,   14:53:22

1     um -- that the link had been established.            14:53:26
2          And in spite of that, the public was still      14:53:29
3     being warned.  While the scientists were trying to   14:53:32
4     figure out whether the evidence was enough for them, 14:53:35
5     the public was being warned.                         14:53:37
6          Reynolds and Philip Morris should not be        14:53:40
7     punished for funding research.                       14:53:42
8          Remember -- do we have that -- can we have the  14:53:44
9     next slide? 14:53:47
10          This is some of the research that was funded    14:53:48
11     with money from Reynolds and Philip Morris.  We      14:53:51
12     shouldn't be punished for that.                      14:53:54
13          Can I have the next one?                        14:53:56
14          We shouldn't be punished for funding research   14:53:58
15     by Nobel prize-winning researchers.  We shouldn't be 14:54:00
16     punished for putting out the green monster.          14:54:05
17     Remember that green book?  You saw it a couple of    14:54:08
18     times, and I put it down on the table.  It made kind 14:54:10
19     of a thud.  That was the one with 6,000 articles     14:54:14
20     made available to the public about the health risks  14:54:16
21     of cigarette smoking and anything related to         14:54:19
22     cigarette smoking.                                   14:54:21
23          We showed you the article by Knapp, K-n-a-p-p,  14:54:21
24     in 1963 that the companies funded that concluded     14:54:25
25     with tobacco-funded research that nicotine was       14:54:29

1     addictive.  14:54:32
2          We talked to you about the research that        14:54:33
3     Dr. Rodgman at Reynolds did, where he was coming up  14:54:36
4     and inventing new ways to really figure out what was 14:54:38
5     in cigarette smoke.  This was at a time in the '50s  14:54:41
6     and '60s where people didn't know.  Reynolds         14:54:44
7     developed that technology, published on it and told  14:54:46
8     everybody about it.                                  14:54:49
9          We shouldn't be punished for recommending --    14:54:51
10     this is really, really important.  We should not --  14:54:54
11     do we have a slide on this -- for recommending       14:54:57
12     against the adoption of the FTC machine method.      14:55:01
13          You've heard a lot of accusations that made it  14:55:05
14     sound like testing low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes  14:55:07
15     on a machine like that was our idea; that the        14:55:14
16     companies came up with that.                         14:55:16
17          But we showed you in 1966 when the Federal      14:55:20
18     Trade Commission was considering doing this, the     14:55:22
19     companies said, don't do this.  The machine method   14:55:23
20     will not reflect what smokers actually get.          14:55:27
21          The thing they're telling you that we were      14:55:30
22     fraudulent about, we told the FTC in 1966 when this  14:55:32
23     was being adopted that that could happen.  And the   14:55:36
24     FTC made the decision to adopt that -- that method   14:55:40
25     against our recommendations.                         14:55:44

1          The companies should not be punished for trying 14:55:48
2     to make cigarettes safer.  There were a lot of       14:55:51
3     accusations made about the character of the          14:55:54
4     companies.  The fact of the matter is these          14:55:58
5     companies were made up of people who were well       14:55:59
6     meaning just like a lot of other well-meaning        14:56:02
7     people. 14:56:04
8          I want to show you just one example that was in 14:56:04
9     evidence. 14:56:07
10          Look at this letter from Galloway to Sinkus     14:56:08
11     [phonetic].  This is the president of R.J. Reynolds  14:56:12
12     in 1968 to the top research scientist at the         14:56:14
13     company.  "Areas of special interest:  In            14:56:16
14     cooperating with others, you should push the work    14:56:20
15     concerning tobacco and health.  You should prepare a 14:56:22
16     plan to foster any relationship with government      14:56:25
17     personnel in the quest for mutual understanding of   14:56:28
18     facts ultimately to gain their cooperation in proper 14:56:31
19     research of the subject."                            14:56:35
20          Remember when -- keep that up for one second.   14:56:36
21          Remember when, I don't know if it was Mr. Berg  14:56:40
22     or Mr. Clark said there's no document that shows     14:56:42
23     that the company cared about their consumers?  There 14:56:44
24     is no document that suggests that Reynolds cares     14:56:46
25     about smokers? 14:56:48

1          Look at this.                                   14:56:49
2          "If there is a safer cigarette, let's continue  14:56:50
3     and increase our efforts in this program.            14:56:53
4          "Please prepare a plan to carry it out."        14:56:56
5          This document wasn't written with the idea that 14:56:59
6     this was going to end up in somebody's newspaper.    14:57:01
7     This is the same kind of secret, internal document   14:57:04
8     that they've been talking about all this time.  And  14:57:07
9     this came right before the ten years long effort by  14:57:09
10     scientists from Reynolds and scientists from Philip  14:57:15
11     Morris working with the government to try to come up 14:57:17
12     with a safer cigarette.                              14:57:20
13          You heard an allegation that the filtered       14:57:24
14     products that we made, that the public health        14:57:25
15     community asked for, Mr. Clark or Mr. Berg said that 14:57:27
16     was a gimmick, that was a gimmick.                   14:57:29
17          Well, what did Dr. Henningfield say?            14:57:31
18     The nine -- the nine -- that $925 an hour?  This is  14:57:33
19     what he said. 14:57:36
20          Do we have that?                                14:57:37
21          Dr. Henningfield, at $15 a minute, said, "If    14:57:39
22     you go back before that to the days when cigarettes  14:57:51
23     were nonfiltered, I think it's likely that for an    14:57:54
24     individual a filter would be better than nonfilter.  14:57:57
25     That's my own opinion."                              14:58:01

1          That's Dr. Henningfield whose evidence tells    14:58:03
2     you filters were not a gimmick.                      14:58:07
3          Can I have the next slide, please?  Go back.    14:58:11
4     Just one second. . .  All right.                     14:58:23
5          Here's something you should really, really      14:58:27
6     think about, about Vantage cigarettes.  This is      14:58:29
7     really interesting and I think really important.     14:58:32
8          The evidence in this case was that the public   14:58:35
9     health community asked the companies to develop      14:58:38
10     cigarettes that would deliver lower tar.             14:58:41
11          At Reynolds, when we were -- when they were     14:58:44
12     working on the Vantage cigarettes, they developed a  14:58:46
13     new filter that scientists inside of Reynolds, in    14:58:49
14     internal secret documents, said to each other that   14:58:53
15     they believed was a better filter than was available 14:58:58
16     on the market. 14:59:01
17          Can I have the next slide, please?              14:59:02
18          Actually, let's take a look at this.            14:59:06
19          Again, remember, the accusation:  There's no    14:59:16
20     secret, internal document that says the companies    14:59:20
21     cared about smokers.                                 14:59:22
22          This was the Vantage technology document that   14:59:24
23     you saw and that was shown to Dr. Henningfield,      14:59:26
24     their design expert.                                 14:59:29
25          What -- you see it?                             14:59:31

1          Here's what it says:  "The Vantage cigarette    14:59:34
2     introduced in April 1970 almost met the original     14:59:36
3     objective of the Coanda filter.  That is, it         14:59:40
4     provided a novel filter with substantially better    14:59:43
5     filtration than the standard Winston filter without  14:59:46
6     unacceptable pressure drop increase."                14:59:51
7          Okay.  14:59:53
8          "A presentation to management was held in the   14:59:54
9     research department on November 18th, 1968.  There   14:59:58
10     it was reported that the multijet filter showed 60   15:00:01
11     percent tar removal from cigarette smoke as compared 15:00:04
12     to 40 percent tar removal by the Winston filter at   15:00:08
13     the same pressure drop of two inches."               15:00:11
14          What does all that mean?  This was a better     15:00:14
15     filter that was going to be used in the Vantage      15:00:16
16     cigarettes, and this is what the scientists at       15:00:19
17     Reynolds genuinely thought.  This document was just  15:00:23
18     as secret as all the other documents they were       15:00:25
19     talking about. 15:00:28
20          These two paragraphs are talking about the      15:00:28
21     performance of the filter on the machine.            15:00:31
22          But look at what else is in this document?      15:00:33
23          "A second presentation to management was held   15:00:36
24     at research on June 18, 1969.                        15:00:38
25          "There, it was reported that the laboratory     15:00:41

1     multijet filter did, indeed, reduce the amount of    15:00:44
2     smoke retained by a smoker."                         15:00:48
3          Not just on some machine; retained by a smoker. 15:00:50
4          And Dr. Henningfield said after he saw this     15:00:55
5     document, he said, well, yeah, I mean, I -- I know   15:00:58
6     that there's Vantage smoking in this case, but I     15:01:01
7     didn't spend time looking at the design of Vantage   15:01:04
8     cigarettes.  But now that I've seen this, yeah, this 15:01:06
9     may have been a product that actually reduced tar    15:01:09
10     yields to a smoker.                                  15:01:12
11          This isn't fraud, folks.                        15:01:14
12          This is a company doing what it's supposed to   15:01:15
13     be doing.  This technology was incorporated in the   15:01:18
14     Vantage cigarette, it was put on the market and it   15:01:22
15     was marketed to people not as a safe or safer        15:01:24
16     cigarette, but simply as a low-tar, low-nicotine     15:01:26
17     cigarette that nevertheless was able to have good    15:01:30
18     flavor. 15:01:32
19          So think about this:  We're being asked to be   15:01:33
20     punished for this.  Imagine what would happen if we  15:01:38
21     had done the opposite.  If this were a case where    15:01:41
22     they came to you and said, the companies came up     15:01:44
23     with this fabulous technology that's actually better 15:01:46
24     filtration and actually reduces the amount of smoke  15:01:49
25     that goes to the smoker; and instead of              15:01:52

1     incorporating it into the cigarettes, let's say we   15:01:54
2     buried it.  We buried the technology, we didn't      15:01:57
3     incorporate it into a cigarette product, we didn't   15:01:58
4     tell anybody about it, we didn't give any smoker the 15:02:00
5     option to smoke it.                                  15:02:03
6          Would they be patting us on the back for that,  15:02:05
7     or would they be saying you really should be         15:02:07
8     punished for that?  You had this technology, you     15:02:09
9     didn't put it out there, you didn't market it?       15:02:11
10     That's punishable conduct.  It's not what happened   15:02:13
11     here. 15:02:15
12          This was genuinely believed to be an            15:02:16
13     improvement.  It was incorporated into our products, 15:02:20
14     put on the market, not marketed with anything false, 15:02:22
15     just reported with -- the tar and nicotine numbers   15:02:25
16     the FTC required us to report, and billed as a       15:02:27
17     flavored cigarette.  But it was on the market.  That 15:02:31
18     is simply not punishable conduct.                    15:02:35
19          And then, later, in the 1980s and 1990s, you    15:02:39
20     heard that Reynolds spent millions and millions of   15:02:41
21     dollars developing this product called Premier.  And 15:02:44
22     what happened? 15:02:47
23          Dr. Henningfield agreed this Premier product    15:02:50
24     actually reduced cancer risks.  What was the         15:02:54
25     response to that?                                    15:02:57

1          Can I have the next one?                        15:02:58
2          The Office of Smoking and Health -- this is a   15:02:59
3     government office -- said that, "Preliminary         15:03:05
4     research conducted by the developers showed that     15:03:09
5     there were fewer carcinogens in Premier.             15:03:11
6     Nevertheless, if you look at the middle ones, the    15:03:15
7     panel was concerned about the ramifications of a     15:03:17
8     cigarette that is actually safer than current        15:03:19
9     cigarettes." 15:03:22
10          And then at the bottom, "Research should        15:03:22
11     continue, but there is no need to wait for results   15:03:26
12     to initiate a war against new tobacco products."     15:03:28
13          What am I really talking about here?  You're    15:03:33
14     being asked to punish us for doing what we should be 15:03:36
15     doing:  Trying to put a safer product on the markets 15:03:38
16     with Vantage, with Premier.  That is not punishable  15:03:41
17     conduct. 15:03:45
18          Now, can we take that down?                     15:03:49
19          There's one last thing on this topic that I     15:03:51
20     think is really important for you to understand that 15:03:54
21     you heard in the evidence.                           15:03:56
22          What is the context for all these allegations   15:03:57
23     about the FTC machine, the numbers that were being   15:04:00
24     reported in the ads?  What was the regulatory        15:04:03
25     environment that Reynolds and Philip Morris were     15:04:07

1     operating in? 15:04:08
2          This is what you heard because Mr. Clark or     15:04:11
3     Mr. Berg said, we sat right back and let it happen.  15:04:13
4     All this tar and nicotine numbers were deceptive and 15:04:16
5     we sat right back and let it happen.  What's the     15:04:19
6     real story? 15:04:22
7          The real story is, the companies told the FTC   15:04:23
8     you shouldn't adopt this machine method because it's 15:04:27
9     going to mislead consumers.  You shouldn't do it.    15:04:29
10          The FTC made the decision to do it anyway.      15:04:32
11          Outside of our control.                         15:04:36
12          The Federal Trade Commission required us to     15:04:37
13     report those numbers in the magazine ads.            15:04:42
14          The -- this idea that the companies were        15:04:45
15     putting deceptive numbers in their advertising isn't 15:04:49
16     true.  The Federal Trade Commission required the     15:04:52
17     companies to do that.                                15:04:54
18          Then, remember when Lorillard came along?  You  15:04:56
19     saw this letter.  Lorillard happened to be the first 15:04:59
20     one to do it, they come along and they say, we've    15:05:02
21     got these machine numbers, but we think that our     15:05:04
22     product might actually be delivering higher tar      15:05:07
23     yields than what the machine yields.  We'd like to   15:05:10
24     print that.  The FTC said no.  You cannot put higher 15:05:12
25     numbers on there than what the machine comes up      15:05:17

1     with. 15:05:19
2          That's not a decision that any of these         15:05:20
3     companies made; that was an FTC decision.            15:05:22
4          And then, as we already saw, the Federal Trade  15:05:25
5     Commission and the Public Health Service was         15:05:29
6     encouraging smokers to switch to these types of      15:05:32
7     products; even telling them, we'll give you a list   15:05:34
8     of the products you can buy if you just send us in   15:05:36
9     the mail [sic].                                      15:05:41
10          Now, I'm not trying to attack the Federal Trade 15:05:43
11     Commission.  I'm really not.  All I'm suggesting is  15:05:46
12     that we are not responsible for those decisions that 15:05:48
13     the FTC made.  You shouldn't punish us for putting   15:05:51
14     numbers in our ads that the FTC required us to       15:05:54
15     publish. 15:05:57
16          So for all of those reasons, we ask that you    15:05:59
17     check "no" to these questions about punitive         15:06:02
18     damages, and that you check "no" to the other        15:06:06
19     questions in this case that we identify.             15:06:08
20          At the end of the day, this case is not about   15:06:11
21     sympathy, just like I told you at the beginning.     15:06:14
22     It's not about sympathy.  You heard a very -- you    15:06:16
23     heard some very compelling testimony that might have 15:06:20
24     made -- would make anyone, really, feel sympathy     15:06:23
25     towards the loss of a human life.                    15:06:27

1          But that's not enough in a court of law to      15:06:29
2     award money damages.                                 15:06:33
3          There has to be evidence, and they don't have   15:06:34
4     the evidence to support that here.                   15:06:37
5          This is not a case about whether cigarettes     15:06:39
6     should be legal.  It's not a case about whether they 15:06:42
7     should be banned.                                    15:06:45
8          And it's not a case about other smokers who may 15:06:46
9     have -- maybe other smokers didn't know this, maybe  15:06:50
10     other smokers didn't have this fork-in-the-road      15:06:54
11     opportunity where they were kind of forced to be off 15:06:56
12     cigarettes and had to decide whether to go back to   15:06:58
13     it.   15:07:01
14          But in this case, the evidence is at the end of 15:07:01
15     the day right where it was at the beginning of the   15:07:05
16     day.  Mr. Ramsay was a willing smoker who knew the   15:07:06
17     risks and liked what smoking did for him.  He wasn't 15:07:10
18     interested in quitting until he did, and nicotine    15:07:12
19     did not control him.                                 15:07:15
20          And he most certainly was not misled by         15:07:16
21     anything that the tobacco companies or anyone in the 15:07:20
22     conspiracy with them, said.                          15:07:23
23          We're going to be asking you, I'm asking you    15:07:26
24     now, to come back with a defense verdict in this     15:07:28
25     case. 15:07:31

1          I've tried as best I know how to summarize the  15:07:31
2     evidence that you've heard, and after I sit down,    15:07:34
3     it'll be Ms. Gallagher's turn to address you.  I     15:07:38
4     know she's -- she's had to be quiet all this time so 15:07:41
5     I know she's eager to talk to you.                   15:07:43
6          And when she finishes, one of the plaintiff's   15:07:45
7     lawyers will have another turn.  And they actually   15:07:48
8     get the last word because it's their burden of       15:07:50
9     proof. 15:07:53
10          So there just won't be a time for you to wait   15:07:53
11     for me to come back and answer those because I won't 15:07:55
12     be able to do that.                                  15:07:58
13          What I will ask you to do, though, is to just   15:07:59
14     think about what our responses would be to what you  15:08:01
15     hear in rebuttal.  You know what our points are, you 15:08:03
16     know what the evidence has been.                     15:08:07
17          Um, and, um, I guess the last thing I need to   15:08:08
18     do then is to just thank you once again.  You've all 15:08:14
19     been patient.  You've all -- you know, we've gone on 15:08:17
20     and on, I go on and on and on, and we start getting, 15:08:21
21     I -- you know, I understand.  We have a lot to say,  15:08:23
22     there's a lot to cover and I appreciate your         15:08:26
23     patience with us.                                    15:08:28
24          You know, Mr. Berg referenced the equal justice 15:08:30
25     under the law there (indicating), and that has to    15:08:33

1     apply even to tobacco companies as well.  Equal      15:08:36
2     justice under the law means, at least in this case,  15:08:40
3     that if the evidence and the law as you get it from  15:08:44
4     the judge does not support a verdict in favor of     15:08:47
5     Mrs. Bishop, you should come back with a defense     15:08:50
6     verdict. 15:08:52
7          You were all chosen because you could do that   15:08:53
8     if the evidence and the law requires it.  We are in  15:08:56
9     your hands.  I'm not asking you for anything more    15:08:59
10     than you follow the law, listen to your common       15:09:03
11     sense, apply the evidence, and, yes, come back with  15:09:05
12     a verdict in favor of the defense.                   15:09:08
13          Thank you very much.                            15:09:10


22          MS. GALLAGHER:  Thank you, Your Honor.          15:10:25
23          Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.           15:10:26
24          FROM THE FLOOR:  Good afternoon.                15:10:28
25          MS. GALLAGHER:  Three facts.  Three facts are   15:10:30

1     all you need to decide this case.  Three facts.  And 15:10:35
2     they come from the plaintiff's witnesses.  They      15:10:39
3     don't come from documents.  They don't come from     15:10:42
4     arguments.  They're just three facts.  Three facts   15:10:46
5     that everybody agrees to.                            15:10:50
6          And those facts are from 1974.  And by that     15:10:52
7     date you know what I'm going to talk about.          15:10:57
8          Fact No. 1:  Mr. Ramsay quit smoking for 24     15:11:00
9     days. 15:11:08
10          Mrs. Bishop tells you that.                     15:11:09
11          Fact 2:  When Mr. Ramsay started smoking again, 15:11:26
12     after he quit for 24 days, there was no nicotine in  15:11:32
13     his system.  He was nicotine-free.                   15:11:37
14          Dr. Hurt told you that.                         15:11:47
15          Fact No. 3:  If Mr. Ramsay had chosen to remain 15:11:52
16     as a nonsmoker, if he had decided not to start       15:11:58
17     smoking again, he likely would not have developed    15:12:03
18     lung cancer. 15:12:07
19          No lung cancer.                                 15:12:13
20          Dr. Villa told you that and we wouldn't be      15:12:20
21     here. 15:12:27
22          So the very first question you're going to be   15:12:29
23     asked to decide is, was Robert L. Ramsay addicted to 15:12:32
24     cigarettes containing nicotine; and if so, was such  15:12:36
25     addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer?          15:12:40

1          A legal cause.                                  15:12:43
2          You have the definition.  That means it was a   15:12:46
3     substantial cause.  A but-for cause.                 15:12:49
4          And so what that means is but for his           15:12:52
5     addiction, could Mr. Ramsay have quit smoking in     15:12:55
6     time to avoid his lung cancer?                       15:12:59
7          And these three facts explain why the           15:13:03
8     question -- the answer to question No. 1 is "No."    15:13:08
9          You know that in 1974, when Mr. Ramsay had this 15:13:13
10     pneumothorax, this collapsed lung, he ended up in    15:13:18
11     the hospital for ten days and he was basically       15:13:21
12     unconscious for those ten days.  He could not smoke. 15:13:23
13          But then he got out of the hospital and for the 15:13:27
14     next two weeks, he made the decision every day to be 15:13:29
15     a nonsmoker.  He did not smoke.                      15:13:35
16          Fact No. 1:  He quit for 24 days.               15:13:41
17          And you know that all the nicotine was out of   15:13:43
18     his system.  Dr. Hurt explained that.  He said       15:13:46
19     within three days, nicotine is completely gone from  15:13:50
20     a person's body.  Mr. Ramsay didn't pick up          15:13:53
21     cigarettes again for 24 days.  The nicotine had been 15:13:59
22     out of his system for weeks at that point.           15:14:02
23          And he didn't start smoking again because of    15:14:06
24     withdrawal symptoms, and, again, you know that from  15:14:09
25     Dr. Hurt.  Because Dr. Hurt told you that within 14  15:14:12

1     to 21 days, all the withdrawal symptoms are gone.    15:14:15
2          Not only did you not hear any evidence of any   15:14:20
3     withdrawal symptoms during this period, Dr. Hurt     15:14:23
4     told you that by the time he picked up those         15:14:26
5     cigarettes again on Day 24, those withdrawal         15:14:29
6     symptoms were gone.                                  15:14:32
7          And Dr. Villa explained to you -- he came in    15:14:35
8     and told you, when you quit smoking, your risk of    15:14:38
9     getting a smoking-related disease decreases.         15:14:42
10          It goes down.                                   15:14:45
11          And remember he told you, you get a             15:14:47
12     substantially -- that was his word -- a substantial  15:14:52
13     benefit if you quit after five years.  And then he   15:14:54
14     went further and he put numbers on it.  And          15:14:58
15     Mr. Walker told you about those numbers:  1964, 97   15:15:00
16     to 98 percent.  Decreased risk.                      15:15:03
17          But what he also told you was that back at this 15:15:06
18     time, if Mr. Ramsay had made a decision to stay as a 15:15:11
19     nonsmoker, it is more likely than not that he would  15:15:15
20     not have developed lung cancer and we would not be   15:15:19
21     here. 15:15:23
22          Those three facts, ladies and gentlemen, they   15:15:24
23     answered that very first question for you.  Just     15:15:28
24     those three facts.  And when you answer that first   15:15:31
25     question "No," your work is done.  Your job is done. 15:15:35

1     You put your pen down, and you go home.              15:15:39
2          Now, I told you I would be brief during the     15:15:43
3     course of this trial.  I didn't know how brief.  I   15:15:47
4     don't think there's ever been a trial where I didn't 15:15:50
5     ask a single question, and I'm going to do so again  15:15:53
6     here today. 15:15:55
7          Mr. Walker did an excellent job summarizing the 15:15:56
8     evidence, and I agree with what he said and I'm not  15:16:00
9     going to go back through it.  But I am going to give 15:16:03
10     you, for lack of a better word, kind of a Reader's   15:16:05
11     Digest on Questions 3 through 6.  Those are the      15:16:10
12     questions that basically asked, was Mr. Ramsay       15:16:14
13     defrauded?  Was he somehow fooled into thinking that 15:16:17
14     cigarettes weren't addictive?  Was he somehow fooled 15:16:22
15     into thinking that cigarettes weren't dangerous?     15:16:25
16     Was there something that the tobacco companies said  15:16:27
17     or didn't say that fooled him?                       15:16:30
18          And the answer to that is no, to all of those   15:16:33
19     questions.  For all of the reasons Mr. Walker        15:16:35
20     explained.  15:16:40
21          And for reasons that came directly from         15:16:41
22     Mrs. Bishop.  Because Mrs. Bishop was asked by her   15:16:46
23     own attorney, Mr. Berg, after she -- he asked her    15:16:49
24     questions and then Mr. Walker asked her questions,   15:16:53
25     Mr. Berg came back and said, you're not saying that  15:16:56

1     Mr. Ramsay knew that nicotine was an addictive drug  15:16:58
2     in the 1970s, are you?                               15:17:02
3          And she said, yeah.  I think he did know that.  15:17:04
4          When she was directly asked by Mr. Walker, so   15:17:10
5     it's fair to say that your husband knew about the    15:17:15
6     health risks of smoking back from the time you got   15:17:19
7     married?  Back to 1961?                              15:17:22
8          And what was her answer?  Yeah, I suppose he    15:17:25
9     did.  15:17:29
10          Now, the plaintiffs have come in here and tried 15:17:32
11     to make a big deal about filters and about low tar   15:17:34
12     and say that somehow Mr. Ramsay was fooled by that.  15:17:36
13     Well, all you need to do is look at what Mr. Ramsay  15:17:39
14     said and how he acted.                               15:17:42
15          When he told his children, do not smoke         15:17:45
16     cigarettes, he didn't say, don't smoke cigarettes    15:17:48
17     unless you smoke filtered cigarettes or unless you   15:17:53
18     smoke low-tar cigarettes.  He told them, do not      15:17:55
19     smoke cigarettes.                                    15:17:59
20          When his wife would get on him, his friends,    15:18:00
21     his kids and say, you need to quit smoking, it's bad 15:18:05
22     for you, it's killing you.  He didn't say, oh, it's  15:18:08
23     okay; I'm smoking a low-tar cigarette.  It's okay,   15:18:14
24     I'm smoking a filtered cigarette.  What he said      15:18:18
25     was. . . Every time that Mr. Ramsay picked up a      15:18:22

1     package of cigarettes, it had a warning on the side. 15:18:28
2     And he saw the exact same warning for every type of  15:18:32
3     cigarette he picked up, whether it was filtered,     15:18:36
4     unfiltered, low-tar, or full-flavored.               15:18:39
5          If Mr. Ramsay heard anything that the tobacco   15:18:44
6     companies were saying -- and there is no evidence    15:18:47
7     that he did -- he obviously didn't believe any of    15:18:49
8     it.   15:18:54
9          And one thing to remember is all of those       15:18:58
10     questions, 3 through 6, also have legal cause.  That 15:19:00
11     same thing in there, the legal cause that you have   15:19:04
12     to consider for this.  And that brings you back to   15:19:07
13     the three facts you need to answer, the three facts  15:19:09
14     you need for -- to answer these questions, comes     15:19:12
15     back to Dr. Villa.                                   15:19:16
16          If he had quit smoking and remained a nonsmoker 15:19:19
17     in 1974, then we wouldn't be here.                   15:19:23
18          Now, I told you at the beginning of this case   15:19:27
19     that this was a case about Mr. Ramsay and the        15:19:30
20     decisions he made.  And it still is.  This is a case 15:19:34
21     about Mr. Ramsay who quit for 24 days.  Mr. Ramsay   15:19:39
22     who when he picked up cigarettes again, knowing full 15:19:46
23     well the risks associated with smoking, had no       15:19:49
24     nicotine in his system at all.                       15:19:53
25          Mr. Ramsay, who made the decision not to remain 15:19:57

1     a nonsmoker and if he had, we wouldn't be here       15:20:01
2     today. 15:20:08
3          Those were his decisions.  And those were his   15:20:09
4     decisions to make.  And as Mr. Walker said, we're    15:20:14
5     not criticizing him for making those decisions.  But 15:20:16
6     when you make decisions, you accept the              15:20:20
7     responsibility for those decisions.                  15:20:22
8          And now Mrs. Bishop is asking you to award her  15:20:25
9     money for his decisions.  Don't do it.  The evidence 15:20:30
10     in this case simply does not support it.             15:20:36
11          And that's why, ladies and gentlemen, you       15:20:39
12     should return a verdict for the defendants in this   15:20:42
13     case. 15:20:45
14          Let me conclude by echoing what everybody has   15:20:47
15     told you, and we are all very sincere in this, thank 15:20:50
16     you for your time, thank you for your attention, and 15:20:54
17     thank you for your jury service.  We appreciate it   15:20:56
18     and our clients appreciate it.                       15:21:01
19          Thank you.                                      15:21:03
25          THE COURT:  Thank you.                          16:17:51
