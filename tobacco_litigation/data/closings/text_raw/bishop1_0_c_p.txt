12                     CLOSING ARGUMENT                      10:54
13           MR. CLARK:  Good morning.  I came down with a   10:54
14      little bit of a stuffy nose this morning, so I       10:54
15      apologize for my coughing and my voice this          10:54
16      morning. 10:54
17           What I want to do -- you've been given a lot    10:54
18      of evidence in this case, a lot of evidence.  In     10:54
19      fact, the cart's full of it.                         10:54
20           But those documents all have different          10:54
21      relevance to different issues that you're going to   10:54
22      have to decide.                                      10:54
23           And I know we went through it pretty quickly    10:54
24      during the testimony with the witnesses, but what I  10:55
25      want to do is give you an opportunity to write down  10:55

1      some of those numbers and what we believe the        10:55
2      evidence -- what claims the evidence go to, because  10:55
3      there's going to be a lot of documents.  I think     10:55
4      there's about 160 different pieces of evidence that  10:55
5      you'll get.  And if you're looking for something,    10:55
6      this will give you an idea of where to start.        10:55
7           You've been with us now for almost two and a    10:55
8      half weeks.  And you've heard this before.  You'll   10:55
9      hear it again.  I don't believe I'll be the last     10:55
10      one to say it, but we do thank you for your time.    10:55
11           We've tried to go through this case as quickly  10:55
12      as possible.  We try to give you the evidence as     10:55
13      concise and quickly as possible.  We want to         10:55
14      respect your time.  We know your time is valuable.   10:55
15      And I think everybody here, including the Court and  10:55
16      the defendants, appreciate the sacrifices you've     10:55
17      made to be here.                                     10:55
18           But nonetheless, we are here.  And we've got    10:55
19      some questions that we need you to answer.  So I'm   10:56
20      only going to spend a little bit of time with you    10:56
21      this morning; and then I'm going to defer some time  10:56
22      to Mr. Berg, who's going to talk to you about some   10:56
23      other issues. 10:56
24           The questions that you'll have to answer on     10:56
25      the verdict form we'll talk about in my portion      10:56

1      here or at least a bulk of them we'll talk about in  10:56
2      my portion.  What I plan to do is I plan to give     10:56
3      you some reminders of what you heard and what you    10:56
4      saw during the last two weeks from the witnesses on  10:56
5      the stand and from the documents and the slides      10:56
6      that we showed you.                                  10:56
7           What I want to talk just briefly about is       10:56
8      Robert Ramsay.  Family and his friends called him    10:56
9      Bert.  We know a little bit about Mr. Ramsay.  We    10:56
10      don't know everything.                               10:56
11           We know that he began smoking when he was in    10:56
12      his teens.  We know that Mrs. Ramsay [sic] met him   10:56
13      when he was 17 years old, just a few weeks after     10:56
14      turning 17. 10:57
15           We know that he was smoking Camel unfiltered    10:57
16      cigarettes at that time.  The medical records tell   10:57
17      us that he was smoking enough to put his smoking --  10:57
18      that he began smoking back during his teenage        10:57
19      years. 10:57
20           What we showed you was documents from           10:57
21      R.J. Reynolds reflecting that smokers begin smoking  10:57
22      approximately when they are 16.7, I believe, was     10:57
23      the actual amount.  So roughly 16 years of age is a  10:57
24      good -- a good starting point for when people start  10:57
25      smoking. 10:57

1           And we know from the evidence that Mr. Ramsay   10:57
2      fit right square in the middle of that time period.  10:57
3           We know that in 1958, when Mr. Ramsay was 17    10:57
4      years old and he was smoking Camel unfiltered, we    10:57
5      know that there were no warnings on cigarette        10:57
6      packs.  We know there was no Surgeon General's       10:57
7      report. 10:58
8           The warnings that were read to you in your      10:58
9      instructions that you'll see, those warnings didn't  10:58
10      go on until 1966, two years after the release of     10:58
11      the first original Surgeon General's report.         10:58
12           The documents that we submitted to you that     10:58
13      were written by the scientists, the executives, the  10:58
14      directors, the chairman of the board, whoever it     10:58
15      might be from these two defendants, those secret     10:58
16      documents, they were never meant to see the light    10:58
17      of day.  But they did.  And we brought them to you.  10:58
18           You have those documents in evidence.  And      10:58
19      they tell you, plain as day, that these two          10:58
20      defendants conspired with other cigarette            10:58
21      manufacturers.  They created organizations.  They    10:58
22      called them Tobacco Industry Research Committee;     10:58
23      changed the name to Council for Tobacco Research;    10:59
24      spun off from that, the Tobacco Institute to be a    10:59
25      public relations arm.  But those documents tell us   10:59

1      that they manipulated those cigarettes.              10:59
2           They took what mother nature gave them.  They   10:59
3      take what -- they took what mother nature gave us    10:59
4      all, the tobacco plant.  They exploited what was in  10:59
5      there, the nicotine.  And they did so with the       10:59
6      intent to make a profit.  They didn't care a thing   10:59
7      about their customers, despite the promises they     10:59
8      made in 1953. 10:59
9           The first documents we showed you back Friday,  10:59
10      a week and a half ago, were documents regarding      10:59
11      their efforts to market their deadly product to the  10:59
12      kids of this country.  That was their intent, and    10:59
13      they hid it. 10:59
14           They recognized then that in order to keep      11:00
15      their business alive, they had to market to kids.    11:00
16      They peddled their cigarettes.  They worked over     11:00
17      schools.  They started that back in the 1920s.  One  11:00
18      of the documents we showed you talked about summer   11:00
19      school.  I believe you have it there on the screen.  11:00
20           Kids were the replacement smokers.  One thing   11:00
21      we know about Mr. Ramsay is by 1958, he was a        11:00
22      replacement smoker for somebody who either had quit  11:00
23      or somebody who had died.  And the other thing we    11:00
24      know about Mr. Ramsay is in 1992, somebody else      11:00
25      became a replacement smoker for him.                 11:00

1           We showed you the documents again that talks    11:00
2      about when kids started smoking.  Mr. Ramsay was     11:00
3      one of those kids.                                   11:01
4           Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds knew back in    11:01
5      the '50s:  You gotta hook the kids.  You gotta get   11:01
6      the kids on cigarettes.  That's the future of our    11:01
7      business.  Without it, we will dwindle.              11:01
8           That's what they intended to do, and their      11:01
9      documents prove they did it.  I just want to take a  11:01
10      quick look at that.                                  11:01
11           Younger adult smokers are the only source of    11:01
12      replacement smokers.  They recognized back then,     11:01
13      looking back 50 years from the date of this          11:01
14      document in 1984, going back to 1934, that what      11:01
15      they had to do was they had to get kids smoking in   11:01
16      their teenage years.  And if they didn't, if they    11:01
17      waited until they were in their twenties, they       11:01
18      wouldn't have a customer for life, plain and         11:01
19      simple. 11:02
20           You heard some evidence about this particular   11:02
21      document referencing the young adult market as       11:02
22      being those that are over the age of 18, 18 to 24.   11:02
23      I think you've seen plenty of other documents like   11:02
24      the one before you, where what they're really        11:02
25      talking about is the 14- to 24-year-old.  Some       11:02

1      documents even refer to them as being as young as    11:02
2      12.   11:02
3           The Federal Trade Commission report that you    11:02
4      have in evidence actually noted that cigarette       11:02
5      advertising reaches kids as young as two.            11:02
6           I want to talk to you a few minutes about       11:02
7      something that -- I want to talk to you about        11:02
8      something that we showed you quite often during      11:02
9      Dr. Cummings' testimony.  And it was a slide that    11:02
10      showed the rise of cigarette sales and the rise of   11:02
11      lung cancer. 11:02
12           And I want to remind you that the testimony     11:02
13      was that before the modern cigarette hit the         11:02
14      market, lung cancer was rare.  It was very rare.     11:03
15      People didn't suffer from lung cancer.  It wasn't    11:03
16      until they got into blending and different tobaccos  11:03
17      and the different -- some of the different design    11:03
18      features and marketing that cigarette sales took     11:03
19      off.  11:03
20           Well, by the 1950s, lung cancers were -- lung   11:03
21      cancer was skyrocketing.  That's an epidemic         11:03
22      created solely by these two defendants and their     11:03
23      coconspirators.  Had they not done what they've      11:03
24      done, lung cancer would still be the rare form it    11:03
25      is back then.  They created the epidemic of lung     11:03

1      cancer caused by cigarette smoking.                  11:03
2           They talk about choices.  Bert Ramsay sure      11:03
3      didn't make the choice to create a lung cancer       11:03
4      epidemic.  Bert Ramsay didn't make the choice to     11:03
5      lie and conceal things from the American public.     11:03
6      We'll talk a little bit more about what Bert Ramsay  11:04
7      did and some of his choices in a little bit.         11:04
8           You're going to get a verdict form.  And so     11:04
9      what I would like to do for a few minutes is we're   11:04
10      going to go through this verdict form a little bit.  11:04
11           So one of the very first questions or the very  11:04
12      first question that you're going to have to answer   11:04
13      is whether or not Mr. Ramsay was addicted to         11:04
14      cigarettes containing nicotine and whether or not    11:04
15      that addiction was a legal cause of his lung         11:04
16      cancer.  There's a whole lot going on in that        11:04
17      particular question.  So I'm going to talk about     11:04
18      the different parts of that question individually.   11:04
19           The first thing here is legal cause.  What is   11:04
20      legal cause?  Now, I know the Court read to you the  11:04
21      definition of legal cause.  You'll have the packet   11:04
22      that he read from back there, to go back to and      11:04
23      read and figure this out.  But there's a lot he      11:04
24      read to you.  And those of us who do what I do, we   11:05
25      sometimes struggle with this concept of legal        11:05

1      cause.  But I'd like to read it to you while you've  11:05
2      got it in front of you.                              11:05
3           An addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine  11:05
4      is a legal cause of a disease or medical condition   11:05
5      if it directly and in a natural and continuous       11:05
6      sequence produces or contributes substantially to    11:05
7      producing such disease or medical conditions so      11:05
8      that it can be -- reasonably be said that but for    11:05
9      the addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine,     11:05
10      such disease or medical condition would not have     11:05
11      been suffered. 11:05
12           That's legal cause.                             11:05
13           Sometimes it's referred to as but-for cause.    11:05
14      You see that phrase in there.  But here's the key    11:05
15      word.  In order -- or the key part.                  11:05
16           In order to be regarded as a legal cause of a   11:05
17      disease or a medical condition, an addiction to      11:05
18      cigarettes containing nicotine need not be the only  11:05
19      cause. 11:05
20           There are a lot of things and the law           11:05
21      recognizes there are a lot of things and a lot of    11:06
22      factors that come together to cause some event.      11:06
23           And when you have circumstances where there     11:06
24      are multiple things that come together to cause a    11:06
25      particular event, or in this particular case, lung   11:06

1      cancer and death, the law doesn't say only one of    11:06
2      those things can be the cause to the exclusion of    11:06
3      all others. 11:06
4           They could all be legal cause of lung cancer    11:06
5      and death.  Addiction to cigarettes only needs to    11:06
6      be one of them.  And I think the evidence in this    11:06
7      case is overwhelmingly that Mr. Ramsay was addicted  11:06
8      to cigarettes. 11:06
9           Another key word in there, that very first      11:06
10      sentence, "a legal cause."  The word "the" is not    11:06
11      in there.  "The legal cause" does not appear.  "A    11:06
12      legal cause" is the key.                             11:06
13           What I want to talk about this first question   11:07
14      on the verdict form for a minute, what that          11:07
15      question is not about.  Okay?  See right here,       11:07
16      question is not whether Robert Ramsay had free       11:07
17      choice.  That appears nowhere in the question.       11:07
18           The question is not whether Robert Ramsay was   11:07
19      unable to control himself.  That is not it.          11:07
20           The question is not whether addiction took      11:07
21      over Robert Ramsay's life completely where he        11:07
22      couldn't quit, under no circumstances could he       11:07
23      quit. 11:07
24           The question is simply whether his addiction    11:07
25      was a substantial contributing factor, one factor    11:07

1      among many causes.  And I think the evidence         11:07
2      supports that. 11:07
3           One of the things that we showed you from the   11:07
4      tobacco industry documents is how long ago they      11:07
5      recognized this importance and how hard -- how hard  11:07
6      it is for people, once they get them hooked to       11:07
7      cigarettes, how hard it is to quit smoking.          11:07
8           These documents you have before you are in      11:08
9      evidence. 11:08
10           Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is   11:08
11      both habituating and unique.  Most of those who      11:08
12      have smoked for any significant time would like to   11:08
13      stop.  Many, but not most of those who would like    11:08
14      to stop, are able to do so.                          11:08
15           They knew it way back then.                     11:08
16           What testimony did you hear from the witness    11:08
17      stand about Mr. Ramsay's addiction or whether or     11:08
18      not he was addicted?                                 11:08
19           Clearly, you heard from Dr. Richard Hurt.  Run  11:08
20      the Mayo Clinic for decades, the smoking cessation   11:08
21      clinic at the Mayo Clinic.  Dr. Richard Hurt told    11:08
22      you his opinion:  He clearly was addicted.           11:08
23           He referenced something called the heaviness    11:08
24      of smoking index.  You know, two main questions, if  11:08
25      you can only ask two questions, what are those       11:08

1      questions?  11:08
2           How much do you smoke per day?                  11:08
3           And when do you have your first cigarette in    11:08
4      the morning? 11:08
5           Mr. Ramsay had his first cigarette in the       11:09
6      morning before he even got out of bed.  Had his      11:09
7      ashtray beside the bed.                              11:09
8           Mr. Ramsay smoked at least, I think the         11:09
9      testimony is somewhere between a pack, a pack and a  11:09
10      half, to two packs per day for the bulk of his       11:09
11      life. 11:09
12           Mr. Ramsay had classic withdrawal symptoms      11:09
13      when he was trying to quit:  the irritability, the   11:09
14      anxiousness, the frustration.                        11:09
15           One of the things that I anticipate you'll      11:09
16      probably hear during closing arguments is that, you  11:09
17      know, when Mr. Ramsay made the decision in 1988 to   11:09
18      quit smoking because he wanted to see his            11:09
19      granddaughter graduate from college, that he         11:09
20      started to stop smoking in front of his wife; he     11:09
21      stopped smoking in the house; he stopped smoking in  11:09
22      his office; he stopped smoking on the floor of his   11:09
23      office building; he stopped smoking in the whole     11:09
24      building. 11:09
25           Your common sense, the judge has already told   11:09

1      you, you don't leave your common sense at the door.  11:09
2      You take it back there with you.                     11:10
3           Common sense tells you if Mr. Ramsay was not    11:10
4      addicted, why didn't he just put the cigarettes      11:10
5      down and walk away?  Why did he have to go through   11:10
6      all those steps to finally get smoking under         11:10
7      control where he could quit?                         11:10
8           It just doesn't make sense.  Common sense       11:10
9      tells you he was addicted.  And that's not even      11:10
10      talking about the times on vacation and the other    11:10
11      times that his daughter talked about when he tried   11:10
12      to quit smoking and he would hide it.  And you       11:10
13      could -- she could smell the smoke on him, even      11:10
14      though he's trying to quit.                          11:10
15           Dr. Jack Henningfield, the man who wrote --     11:10
16      the man who wrote the book on nicotine addiction,    11:10
17      the Surgeon General's report from 1988, told you,    11:10
18      by far, the most substantial reason why people       11:10
19      smoke at least a pack a day for -- of cigarettes     11:10
20      for years and decades, even in the face of health    11:10
21      concerns, is nicotine addiction.                     11:11
22           He told you -- he described to you all the      11:11
23      different design features of cigarettes.  He told    11:11
24      you how they manipulate nicotine levels.  Sure,      11:11
25      tobacco companies put less nicotine in it than it    11:11

1      appears in nature.  But there's a reason for that.   11:11
2      The documents we gave you tell you that.             11:11
3      Dr. Henningfield told you that.  The reason is       11:11
4      because nicotine in the natural level is too harsh.  11:11
5      It burns your throat if you smoke it.                11:11
6           Kids can't get hooked on it because they won't  11:11
7      smoke it.  So what they do, they lower the nicotine  11:11
8      level.  But we gave you a document where they        11:11
9      talked about:  How low can we go?  They want to get  11:11
10      rid of the harshness, so they had other ingredients  11:11
11      to it to match the harshness of nicotine.  It makes  11:11
12      it so much smoother to the delicate respiratory      11:11
13      system of our children.                              11:11
14           And it doesn't take long.  Just a little bit    11:11
15      of smoking and you're hooked, and you're hooked for  11:12
16      life.  And for the rest of your life, you'll have    11:12
17      those cravings.                                      11:12
18           They added things like licorice to allow it to  11:12
19      get deeper into the lungs.  They added ventilation   11:12
20      holes to increase the smoothness of the smoke, all   11:12
21      the while, tinkering around and monkeying around     11:12
22      with whatever the nicotine level was so that they    11:12
23      could get the optimal level of it to keep people     11:12
24      smoking.  Otherwise, it would be like smoking        11:12
25      cigars.  It would burn and you wouldn't smoke them.  11:12

1           Michael Criscitiello, Mr. Ramsay's friend,      11:12
2      what was one of the last things he said to you?      11:12
3      Mr. Ramsay told me he was hooked.                    11:12
4           Annie Bishop and Jennifer Hardman, his widow    11:12
5      and his daughter, talked about how he couldn't       11:12
6      stop.  He tried, but he couldn't do it.              11:12
7           That's all evidence that you have that you use  11:13
8      to determine whether or not Mr. Ramsay was addicted  11:13
9      to cigarettes containing nicotine.                   11:13
10           The other part of the question -- let's go      11:13
11      back to that question for a minute, Baron.           11:13
12           The other part of that question has to do with  11:13
13      whether or not that was a legal cause of his lung    11:13
14      cancer.  So we already talked about legal cause.     11:13
15      But let's talk about the lung cancer for a moment.   11:13
16      Mr. Ramsay had lung cancer.  You've seen, you know,  11:13
17      gobbles of evidence that Mr. Ramsay had lung cancer  11:13
18      and he died from it.                                 11:13
19           I don't know how big of a dispute that is.      11:13
20      But clearly the medical records all show that he     11:13
21      had lung cancer.  I believe -- where's that slide,   11:13
22      Baron? 11:13
23           Dr. Villa -- I'm going to go up here where      11:14
24      Dr. Villa was.  He stood up here on this witness     11:14
25      stand and told you these things.  I think he         11:14

1      actually stood up here when he was asked these       11:14
2      questions about whether or not this was a primary    11:14
3      lung cancer.  And he told you these things.          11:14
4           Primary cancer of the lung because the          11:14
5      bronchoscopy saw the cancer in the bronchus.  There  11:14
6      was some testimony about a skin cancer.  But he was  11:14
7      flat out -- you know, that didn't have anything to   11:14
8      do with his lung cancer.  Because if it did, it      11:14
9      would have appeared in a different part of the       11:14
10      lung, not inside the airway, inside the bronchus.    11:14
11           The pattern of metastatic disease to the        11:14
12      mediastinum is classical.  Classical.  The           11:14
13      mediastinum, he told you about this area right here  11:14
14      in the middle, has all this stuff going on where     11:14
15      the lymph nodes are.                                 11:14
16           The pathology report says that keratinizing     11:14
17      squamous cell carcinoma is definitive.  There are    11:14
18      no other suspicious primaries, meaning no other      11:15
19      suspicious tumors anywhere else in the body.         11:15
20           Most importantly, all the specialists, the      11:15
21      treating doctors he had, agreed that this was        11:15
22      primary cancer of the lung and treated him like it   11:15
23      was primary cancer of the lung.  You have a very,    11:15
24      very strong smoking history.  You can't have it any  11:15
25      better than that.  That's what he said.              11:15

1           There's no doubt that Mr. Ramsay's lung cancer  11:15
2      was caused by smoking, and there's no doubt that     11:15
3      his lung cancer or his smoking was caused by         11:15
4      addiction to cigarettes.                             11:15
5           I have a little chart here I would like to      11:15
6      show you about exposures, what Mr. Ramsay exposed    11:15
7      himself to. 11:15
8           One and a half to two packs per day, that's     11:15
9      10,950 to 14,600 cigarettes per year, every year he  11:15
10      smoked.  The average is approximately ten puffs per  11:15
11      cigarette.  That means that Mr. Ramsay, during the   11:15
12      course of his lifetime that he smoked, exposed his   11:15
13      lungs and washed his lungs with 69 different         11:16
14      chemicals that cause cancer, over -- roughly         11:16
15      4 million to 5 million times in the course of his    11:16
16      lifetime. 11:16
17           Next slide, please.                             11:16
18           Let's take a look.  Addiction leads to the      11:16
19      continued smoking.  He tried to quit.  He tried to   11:16
20      quit.  He tried to quit.  There's some testimony     11:16
21      about, you know, he tried all these times on         11:16
22      vacation.  But when the time he really made his      11:16
23      mind up in 1988, he really set his mind to do it.    11:16
24      That's some of the testimony, some of the argument   11:16
25      you'll hear. 11:16

1           You know, they say insanity is doing the same   11:16
2      thing over and over and over and over again,         11:16
3      expecting the same -- a different result.  Well, in  11:16
4      Mr. Ramsay's case, he was a smart man.  He tried     11:16
5      everything he could.  He tried to quit at times      11:16
6      when he had the family's support.  He tried to quit  11:16
7      at times when it wasn't as stressful for him at      11:17
8      work.  And he failed at it.                          11:17
9           Everything else in life he was successful at.   11:17
10      He failed at it.  Then he tried Nicorette gum.  And  11:17
11      he failed at it.  And then he tried the things that  11:17
12      we've already talked about, controlling his          11:17
13      environment.  And you know what?  That finally       11:17
14      worked.  He was finally able to get off cigarettes.  11:17
15           The question is, is why didn't he try it        11:17
16      before?  Who knows?  But the point is, is            11:17
17      Mr. Ramsay was smart.  He looked at it.  He          11:17
18      evaluated his own condition.  And he did things he   11:17
19      could to try to help himself quit.  And one of them  11:17
20      finally worked.                                      11:17
21           The only problem is, it was just too late for   11:17
22      Mr. Ramsay. 11:17
23           Addiction leads to the continued smoking,       11:17
24      which leads to the continued exposure of             11:17
25      carcinogens, which leads to the lung cancer which    11:17

1      finally killed him.                                  11:18
2           So the answer to question number one clearly    11:18
3      is a yes.  His addiction to cigarettes is what       11:18
4      caused him to smoke for all those years.  And        11:18
5      without his addiction, he wouldn't have developed    11:18
6      lung cancer.  And that was testimony from            11:18
7      Dr. Villa.  11:18
8           Once you get through the first question and     11:18
9      answer yes that he's -- then he's a class member.    11:18
10      That's -- that's -- that's your determination, that  11:18
11      he's a class member.                                 11:18
12           Then you've got some more questions to ask.     11:18
13      But those Engle findings that you've been told       11:18
14      about, that smoking causes lung cancer and nicotine  11:18
15      is addictive, that the tobacco companies concealed   11:18
16      material information from the public, that they      11:18
17      conspired with one another to conceal material       11:18
18      information from the public, all those become        11:18
19      binding on you.  They become binding on us.  They    11:18
20      become binding on them.  They become binding on the  11:18
21      Court.  They're set in stone once you get to that    11:18
22      point.  And they apply.                              11:19
23           So what you're going to get to is the next      11:19
24      questions after the first couple of questions about  11:19
25      whether or not smoking cigarettes caused his lung    11:19

1      cancer and death.  You're going to get to those      11:19
2      questions that evaluate their conduct.  Now you're   11:19
3      going to start to really look at what they did.      11:19
4      And let's talk about what they did for a little      11:19
5      bit.  11:19
6           Oh, before I leave that, that's a good point.   11:19
7      Dr. Henningfield gave you something that I think is  11:19
8      very beneficial.  He gave you the definition of      11:19
9      addiction, that when he was at the National          11:19
10      Institute of Drug Abuse, NIDA, I wrote it, but he    11:19
11      told it to you from the stand:  Chronic relapsing    11:19
12      brain disease characterized by compulsive use,       11:19
13      often in the face of harm.                           11:19
14           Chronic relapsing.  He tried to quit and he     11:19
15      went right back.  He tried to quit; he went right    11:19
16      back.  That's chronic relapsing.                     11:20
17           Brain disease, you heard all about that from    11:20
18      Dr. Henningfield, about the nicotine receptors, how  11:20
19      the nicotine goes in there, causes the release of    11:20
20      the chemicals that make you feel good.               11:20
21           Characterized by compulsive use.  If not        11:20
22      smoking 50 to 60 packs [sic] of cigarettes per day   11:20
23      isn't compulsive use, then that -- there's no such   11:20
24      thing. 11:20
25           In the face of harm.  You know, we're not       11:20

1      saying that Mr. Ramsay was an idiot and stuck his    11:20
2      head in the sand and lived under a rock.  There's    11:20
3      stuff out there.  People knew -- people suspected    11:20
4      smoking caused disease.  People knew that smoking    11:20
5      at least -- whether they knew about how addictive    11:20
6      it was, not sure about that, but they at least knew  11:20
7      that it was definitely at least very hard to break;  11:20
8      that once you start it, it was difficult.            11:20
9           Did Mr. Ramsay know that?  Yeah.  His conduct   11:20
10      tells us that he perceived some of that.  That's     11:20
11      not the point.  That's not the point.  We'll get to  11:21
12      that in a minute.                                    11:21
13           I don't believe you heard any other evidence    11:21
14      other than that the cigarettes manufactured by       11:21
15      Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds caused his           11:21
16      continued smoking and his eventual lung cancer and   11:21
17      death. 11:21
18           So let's go back to the question I was getting  11:21
19      to.  And this question has to do with -- let's go    11:21
20      past that.  There we go.                             11:21
21           These questions have to do with whether or not  11:21
22      Mr. Ramsay relied on what they were putting out.     11:21
23      Now, what we have is we have a conspiracy claim,     11:21
24      and we have a concealment claim.  The concealment    11:21
25      claim is based on material information that they     11:21

1      withheld, that they didn't tell the people about.    11:21
2           And they showed, I don't know, countless        11:21
3      Reader's Digest articles and Time and Newsweek       11:21
4      articles about what was being said about cancer and  11:22
5      smoking.  You did not hear a single bit of evidence  11:22
6      that Mr. Ramsay ever read one of those magazines.    11:22
7           But let's talk about what was out there.        11:22
8      There was some research being conducted that showed  11:22
9      cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.  We showed     11:22
10      you those.  I passed you around the Life magazine    11:22
11      article that you looked at.  Dr. Wynder and          11:22
12      Dr. Graham painted the tar on the backs of mice in   11:22
13      the early '50s, and they developed tumors.  So this  11:22
14      got a wide range of publicity.                       11:22
15           And what happened?  Let me see the consumption  11:22
16      slides real quick, Baron.                            11:22
17           What happened when it got all this publicity?   11:22
18      We've shown you this before, but let's take a look   11:22
19      at it again. 11:22
20           Right here, in the 1950s, very sharp -- I       11:22
21      can't draw on this one, can I?  Right there.  Very   11:22
22      sharp drop in cigarette sales.  Why?  People were    11:23
23      worried about the health risks.  So what do the      11:23
24      tobacco companies do?  They don't come out and say,  11:23
25      You know what?  You're right.  We've got this book   11:23

1      report.  Remember it had been characterized as a     11:23
2      book report?  We've got this book report written by  11:23
3      one of our young scientists who studied, I think,    11:23
4      reference '78, '79 article or something like that    11:23
5      that linked cigarette smoking to lung cancer.  They  11:23
6      didn't come out and say, We know this; let's figure  11:23
7      out what we can do to make them better.  They        11:23
8      didn't just sit back and keep quiet and let the      11:23
9      doctors do their work and figure it out.             11:23
10           No.  They attacked them, called them fanatics.  11:23
11      The same people that took the stand in this case,    11:23
12      Dr. Henningfield, Dr. Cummings, Dr. Hurt, their      11:23
13      predecessors were attacked by these two defendants   11:23
14      and the other conspirators because they were trying  11:23
15      to get the truth out.  Every chance they had, they   11:23
16      went on the offensive.                               11:24
17           But that wasn't enough.  That wasn't enough.    11:24
18      They had to go and they had to give people that      11:24
19      psychological crutch:  filters.  In the 1950s --     11:24
20      you heard some of the statements.  If we -- there's  11:24
21      nothing in there that's injurious to health; but if  11:24
22      there is, we'll take it out with filters.            11:24
23           And what happens to the rise of cigarette       11:24
24      sales? 11:24
25           Put that back up.                               11:24

1           What do we know now?  Filters were a gimmick.   11:24
2      They don't work.  But the tobacco company sold it    11:24
3      as the latest and greatest.  And people by the       11:24
4      millions switched to them, so much so that with, I   11:24
5      think, 2 percent of the filters in the '50s were --  11:24
6      early '50s were filtered to, by the time you get to  11:24
7      the Surgeon General's report in '64, 90-something    11:24
8      percent of them were filtered, I think.  You'll      11:24
9      remember whatever the percentages are.               11:25
10           People bought it, hook, line, and sinker.  And  11:25
11      all the while, they're sitting back there counting   11:25
12      the dollars that that just made them.                11:25
13           They don't work.  They didn't work then, and    11:25
14      they don't work now.                                 11:25
15           And they knew it.                               11:25
16           But it doesn't stop there.  Finally, you get    11:25
17      to the 1960s when you have the question asked of     11:25
18      President Kennedy.  He doesn't even know the full    11:25
19      link between smoking and cancer.  And they want      11:25
20      Bert Ramsay to know the full extent of it?           11:25
21           So what happens two weeks after his speech,     11:25
22      his answer?  You have the commission of the Surgeon  11:25
23      General's committee; and then you have the           11:25
24      follow-up, which is the Surgeon General's report,    11:25
25      the very first one, the 1964 report.  And it got so  11:25

1      much publicity.                                      11:25
2           CBS News, one of the only three networks at     11:25
3      the time, had a special on it, a two-hour special.   11:25
4      And we showed you portions of that clip.  Defendant  11:25
5      showed you portions of that clip.                    11:25
6           What happens to cigarette sales?  They drop.    11:26
7           What do they do?  They go on the offensive,     11:26
8      and they start developing these lights and low-tars  11:26
9      and low-nicotine brands, all the while knowing it    11:26
10      doesn't work.  They gave them another psychological  11:26
11      crutch. 11:26
12           Lights and low-tars don't work.  They're not    11:26
13      low-nicotine, low-tar.  They knew it.  They knew     11:26
14      that the smokers were getting bad information from   11:26
15      those machine tests.  And they sat right back and    11:26
16      let it happen.  And they marketed on that.  That's   11:26
17      why you see some of the advertising, advertising     11:26
18      the FTC method, you know, 11 milligrams tar,         11:26
19      .9 milligrams nicotine.                              11:26
20           But we showed you their own internal documents  11:26
21      where they were reverse-engineering one another's    11:26
22      products.  Or at least R.J. Reynolds's was           11:26
23      reverse-engineering Merit.  Where they recognized    11:26
24      that the amount of nicotine that the smoker was      11:26
25      getting from the low-nicotine/low-tar brand was      11:27

1      actually more than the Winston.                      11:27
2           And then going back to Winston, you heard       11:27
3      Dr. Cummings tell you:  When Bert Ramsay switched    11:27
4      from Camel unfiltered to Winston filters around      11:27
5      1960, he switched to a brand of cigarettes that was  11:27
6      giving him two and a half times the amount of        11:27
7      carcinogens than he was getting with the unfiltered  11:27
8      Camel. 11:27
9           They knew it.  They had researched it, and      11:27
10      they knew it. 11:27
11           That, ladies and gentlemen, is a material       11:27
12      fact. 11:27
13           Would Bert Ramsay have acted differently if     11:27
14      he'd have known switching to what he perceived to    11:27
15      be a safer cigarette was, in fact, actually two and  11:27
16      a half times more dangerous for him than the         11:27
17      current one he was smoking?  Would that have made a  11:27
18      difference to him?  Absolutely.                      11:27
19           He did just what they wanted him to do when     11:27
20      they wanted him to do it.  And that was what you     11:27
21      heard from Dr. Cummings.                             11:27
22           To the defendants, Bert Ramsay was a success    11:27
23      story.  The only problem with it is he didn't live   11:27
24      long enough to make them more money.                 11:28
25           So when you're looking at this question, you    11:28

1      have the same legal cause issue to deal with when    11:28
2      you're talking about concealment.                    11:28
3           So the concealment that they did, this was the  11:28
4      type of information.  Not that they withheld the     11:28
5      fact that smoking causes lung cancer.  People were   11:28
6      recognizing that.  And people like Dr. Henningfield  11:28
7      and Dr. Hurt and Dr. Cummings were trying their      11:28
8      hardest to get the truth out.  But you heard         11:28
9      Dr. Henningfield even say it himself.  I was         11:28
10      bamboozled.  The whole government was bamboozled by  11:28
11      this light, low-tar, filter stuff.                   11:28
12           Those are the material facts that were          11:28
13      withheld, that filters don't work, that lights and   11:28
14      low tars don't mean lights and low tars, that        11:28
15      you're really getting just as much as you were       11:28
16      before. 11:28
17           And then they started with the -- carrying on   11:28
18      into the 1980s, the open controversy.  They had      11:29
19      been spreading this controversy message since 1953.  11:29
20      They challenged the people who were coming out and   11:29
21      speaking about how, you know, there's this link      11:29
22      between smoking and disease, and they challenged     11:29
23      them and they attacked them.                         11:29
24           You heard the -- you saw the video from         11:29
25      Mr. Dwyer in 1979.  You remember the video we        11:29

1      showed you where he's standing up there in front of  11:29
2      the curtain.  He must have 50 or 60 microphones in   11:29
3      front of him.  And the first thing out of his mouth  11:29
4      is, it was suspect from the start.                   11:29
5           He's attacking the Surgeon General's report.    11:29
6      The people who were trying to get the truth out,     11:29
7      get smoking rates down, get lung cancer rates down.  11:29
8      No mercy for these people.  They brought all their   11:29
9      resources to bear to attack every chance they        11:29
10      could.  All the while, giving their customers a      11:29
11      reason to keep smoking.                              11:30
12           Every time Bert Ramsay tried to quit, they      11:30
13      intercepted that.  They intercepted it with a        11:30
14      gimmick.  Don't quit, go to the filters.  Don't      11:30
15      quit, go to the low tars.  And it killed him.  Bert  11:30
16      Ramsay's dead because he believed what he heard.     11:30
17           Let's take a look at that question, the         11:30
18      concealment question.                                11:30
19           Please state whether Mr. Ramsay reasonably      11:30
20      relied to his detriment on any statement by          11:30
21      R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company that concealed or      11:30
22      omitted material information concerning the health   11:30
23      effects and/or addictive nature of smoking           11:30
24      cigarettes.  And if so, whether such reliance was a  11:30
25      legal cause of his death.                            11:30

1           There's that legal cause thing in there again,  11:30
2      that but for.  It doesn't have to be the only        11:30
3      cause.  It doesn't have to be -- sure it isn't the   11:30
4      cause that you have to establish.                    11:31
5           Their decision, their choice, they want to      11:31
6      talk about choices, their choice to lie about what   11:31
7      filters do and what filters don't do, their choice   11:31
8      to lie about low tars and low nicotine, their        11:31
9      choice to attack the Surgeon General, to try to      11:31
10      make this an open controversy.                       11:31
11           By the way, you'll see that in the question.    11:31
12      But 1982, May 5th, 1982, the open controversy that   11:31
13      the chairman of the board of R.J. Reynolds -- we     11:31
14      showed you the clip of him on Nightline, this, can   11:31
15      we have an open debate about smoking, that's 1984.   11:31
16      He's still trying.  These defendants are still       11:31
17      trying to convince people there's some question      11:31
18      about smoking and health.                            11:31
19           And there is no consensus.  You heard it from   11:31
20      the witness stand.  There was no consensus -- or     11:31
21      there was no dispute about the consensus.  All the   11:31
22      doctors, all the scientists were convinced smoking   11:31
23      causes cancer. 11:31
24           The only body out there saying otherwise are    11:31
25      these companies, but you heard how much they do.     11:31

1      They spend more in one day than the public health    11:32
2      community could get out in a whole year.             11:32
3           So did Mr. Ramsay rely?  Absolutely.  You can   11:32
4      refer -- or you can infer from all the wallpaper     11:32
5      that Dr. Cummings talked about, all the wallpaper    11:32
6      advertising and all the programs, all the            11:32
7      commercials, the Project Truth.  Remember the        11:32
8      gentleman coming down the halls of Congress talking  11:32
9      about these respected doctors who testified at the   11:32
10      91st Congress, that there's -- there hasn't been     11:32
11      proven there's a link between cigarettes and         11:32
12      smoking. 11:32
13           But what you also heard from Dr. Cummings is    11:32
14      how those respected scientists were bought and paid  11:32
15      for by CTR funds, the special projects.              11:32
16           So did he rely?  Sure, he did.  His behavior    11:32
17      is consistent with the fact that he relied.          11:32
18      R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris put out there,       11:32
19      filters are safer.  And when they did it, he         11:33
20      followed.  They put out there that lights and low    11:33
21      tars were safer.  And when they did it, he           11:33
22      followed.  A success story for these two defendants  11:33
23      that Dr. Cummings talked about.                      11:33
24           Let's go to the Frank Statement, please,        11:33
25      Baron.  36.  That's what I have.                     11:33


1       How much time?
2           MS. CHERRY:  Thirty-nine minutes, Mr. Clark.    11:33
3           MR. CLARK:  Okay.  Thank you.                   11:33
4           You remember the Frank Statement.  We showed    11:33
5      it to you a few times.  It's in evidence.  You'll    11:33
6      be able to see it.                                   11:33
7           This was their promises in 1954 when this was   11:33
8      published.  You'll remember the story about when     11:33
9      stock prices fell, the cigarette companies met.      11:33
10      Fierce competitors.  Didn't do stuff like this       11:34
11      before then.  But this was such a blow to their      11:34
12      business when stock prices started to fall, that     11:34
13      they locked arms and decided to meet.                11:34
14           And what did they meet?  They meet for one      11:34
15      purpose.  They're going to figure out a way to make  11:34
16      a public relations campaign and create doubt, and    11:34
17      the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was the --   11:34
18      was the result of that meeting.  And here's what     11:34
19      they said.  11:34
20           They made these promises.  So from the very     11:34
21      first day that -- after they started to agree that   11:34
22      they can -- they're going to attack this stuff,      11:34
23      they're not going to take this lying down, they      11:34
24      start with this controversy, that medical research   11:34
25      of recent years indicates many possible causes of    11:34

1      lung cancer. 11:34
2           That is contradictory to what Claude Teague     11:34
3      said in that memorandum in R.J. Reynolds 11 months   11:34
4      before.  But that Claude Teague memorandum wasn't    11:34
5      released with the Frank Statement.                   11:34
6           There is -- that -- there is no agreement       11:35
7      among the authorities regarding what the cause is.   11:35
8      Dr. Cummings said that wasn't true.                  11:35
9           That there is no proof that cigarette smoking   11:35
10      is one of the causes.  There's ample proof.  And     11:35
11      they knew it.  They knew it.                         11:35
12           Those three statements were lies, and they      11:35
13      knew it then. 11:35
14           We accept an interest in people's health as a   11:35
15      basic responsibility paramount to every other        11:35
16      consideration in our business.  The evidence has     11:35
17      been overwhelming that the only thing they cared     11:35
18      about was money.  Money, money.  How can they get    11:35
19      more of it. 11:35
20           There's a document in evidence that we showed   11:35
21      to you that you can look at.  I believe it's         11:35
22      Dr. Teague also, talks about how if the exit gates   11:35
23      to their market, meaning if people were able to      11:35
24      quit smoking and get off cigarettes, many of them    11:35
25      would.  And if the exit gates open, they'd be out    11:35

1      of business overnight.                               11:36
2           All they cared about was the survivability of   11:36
3      their business.  They did not care about the health  11:36
4      of their consumers.                                  11:36
5           We believe the products we make are not         11:36
6      injurious to health.  Another lie.  The problem is,  11:36
7      people didn't really know that then.                 11:36
8           We always have and always will cooperate        11:36
9      closely with those whose task it is to safeguard     11:36
10      the public health.  No, they didn't.  No, they       11:36
11      didn't.  Not once did they cooperate.  You heard     11:36
12      some testimony about the Tobacco Working Group and   11:36
13      how they talked about cooperating with the National  11:36
14      Cancer Institute to kind of figure out how to make   11:36
15      a safer cigarette.                                   11:36
16           What you have in evidence is the rest of the    11:36
17      documents regarding that, where they're basically    11:36
18      telling each other that we're going to stay in the   11:36
19      Tobacco Working Group because we need to protect     11:36
20      the industry. 11:36
21           Let's go to the -- this question's not          11:37
22      about -- likely addiction question, the class        11:37
23      membership question.  This question is not about     11:37
24      some things as well.                                 11:37
25           The question is not whether the defendants      11:37

1      could have said something that would have made him   11:37
2      stop smoking, although it would have sure helped if  11:37
3      they would have told him the truth about the         11:37
4      filters and the low tars.                            11:37
5           Whether information on harms of smoking was     11:37
6      available.  It was out there.  You know, all the     11:37
7      Reader's Digest and stuff like that.                 11:37
8           Whether Robert Ramsay ever saw a warning.  You  11:37
9      know, that's not part of this question.              11:37
10           The question is whether or not there's false    11:37
11      controversy, that idea that there's an open debate   11:37
12      about smoking, that doctors just aren't sure, that   11:37
13      there's other possible causes other than             11:37
14      cigarettes, whether that was a substantial           11:37
15      contributing factor, one among many causes.          11:37
16           Did they expect -- let's go to the Heimann      11:38
17      slide.  Did they expect their consumers to rely on   11:38
18      it?  We played you the video deposition of one       11:38
19      Robert K. Heimann, formerly the chief executive      11:38
20      officer of American Tobacco, now part of Reynolds.   11:38
21           And we gave you his testimony.  Would you       11:38
22      expect the consumer to rely upon your                11:38
23      advertisements?  Yes.  Our advertisement is          11:38
24      truthful, and we would anticipate that they would    11:38
25      rely on it if they chose.                            11:38

1           And you heard Dr. Cummings talk about the       11:38
2      wallpaper of advertising.  It was everywhere,        11:38
3      television, print, newspapers, billboards, movies.   11:38
4      There wasn't a single place that cigarette           11:38
5      advertising didn't occur.                            11:38
6           I believe one document you had shows that it    11:38
7      was the most heavily advertised product in America.  11:39
8           How do we know filters were a gimmick?  They    11:39
9      said it themselves.  The illusion of filtration is   11:39
10      as important as the fact of filtration.              11:39
11           Not only that, public health community, you     11:39
12      heard them, they were -- Dr. Henningfield, they      11:39
13      were expecting the lung cancer rates to go down.     11:39
14      But they didn't.  They didn't.  Why?                 11:39
15           Finally, finally, when documents like these     11:39
16      get released, we finally find out why.  When         11:39
17      Dr. Henningfield wrote the 1988 Surgeon General's    11:39
18      report, he didn't know -- he himself did not know    11:39
19      everything that they knew.  And this man worked for  11:39
20      C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon General, testified      11:39
21      before Congress several times.  He didn't know all   11:39
22      that they knew.                                      11:39
23           And when that information came out, it made a   11:40
24      difference to him.  Would it have made a difference  11:40
25      to Mr. Ramsay? 11:40

1           You heard a little bit of testimony about this  11:40
2      pneumothorax.  You heard a little bit of testimony   11:40
3      about this pneumothorax, about how he didn't smoke   11:40
4      while he was in the hospital.  What you also heard   11:40
5      was he was -- he had a tube stuck in his chest to    11:40
6      inflate his lung, and he was on some very powerful   11:40
7      pain medication.                                     11:40
8           So the follow-up to that came when Mrs. Bishop  11:40
9      was asked whether or not the doctor told her         11:40
10      husband whether smoking caused his pneumothorax.     11:40
11      And I believe the testimony was, he said it could    11:40
12      have. 11:40
13           Doesn't really matter what the testimony was,   11:40
14      whether he said it could have, whether he said he    11:40
15      didn't think it did.  It's the unequivocal           11:40
16      statement that it was definitely caused by smoking.  11:41
17      That's what she was looking for.  That's the         11:41
18      important thing.                                     11:41
19           All the rest of the stuff was kind of wissy --  11:41
20      wishy-washy.  Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.  It     11:41
21      could have, I'm not sure.  Those kinds of things.    11:41
22           Let's look at the Tobacco and Health Research   11:41
23      Procedural Memo.                                     11:41
24           Who was the target audience for this            11:41
25      particular document?  Doctors and scientists.  And   11:41

1      if you'll remember, the Tobacco and Health Research  11:41
2      Memo was this publication that they would send to    11:41
3      doctors giving other reasons why smoking wasn't the  11:41
4      cause of certain diseases.  One of the headlines     11:41
5      said, "Large birth causes cancer."  Those are the    11:41
6      kinds of things they were sending to doctors and     11:41
7      scientists. 11:41
8           This document, 1968, Bert Ramsay's              11:41
9      pneumothorax in the early '70s, '74, maybe.  What    11:41
10      are they sending to these doctors?                   11:41
11           Let's go to that, down at the bottom there.     11:42
12           The most important type of story is that which  11:42
13      casts doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of        11:42
14      disease and smoking.                                 11:42
15           I asked Dr. Cummings why would you want to      11:42
16      send that to doctors.  Because you get it to the     11:42
17      patients. 11:42
18           The evidence is clear.  I'm going to wrap it    11:42
19      up here. 11:42
20           The evidence is clear that these companies      11:42
21      figured out ways to make cigarettes the addictive    11:42
22      product that it became.  They manipulated around     11:42
23      with the nicotine levels.  They added ingredients    11:42
24      to make it easier to inhale.  The easier it is to    11:42
25      inhale, the quicker the nicotine gets to the brain,  11:42

1      and you promote addiction by that means.             11:42
2           In addition to doing these things in secret,    11:42
3      what they also were doing in secret was taking a     11:43
4      look at -- taking a look back and seeing just how    11:43
5      effective their 50 years of lying and                11:43
6      deceitfulness, how effective that really was.        11:43
7           For nearly 20 years -- this document's in       11:43
8      evidence for you to read.  For nearly 20 years,      11:43
9      this industry has employed a single strategy to      11:43
10      defend itself on three major fronts; litigation,     11:43
11      politics, and public opinion.                        11:43
12           While the strategy was brilliantly              11:43
13      conceived -- they call themselves brilliant.  They   11:43
14      had the nerve to make a product like they make, lie  11:43
15      to people about it, addict people, addict children,  11:43
16      make profits off of it, lie to them, and then blame  11:43
17      them for killing them.  Have the nerve to call       11:43
18      themselves brilliant.                                11:43
19           And they concede and executed over the years,   11:43
20      helping us win important battles.  It is only fair   11:43
21      to say that it is not, nor was it intended to be a   11:44
22      vehicle for victory.  On the contrary, it has        11:44
23      always been a holding strategy consisting of         11:44
24      creating doubt about the health charge without       11:44
25      actually denying it.  Advocating the public's right  11:44

1      to smoke without actually urging them to take up     11:44
2      the practice. 11:44
3           That's the intervention.  That's when           11:44
4      Mr. Ramsay's trying to quit.  They say, no, you      11:44
5      don't need to quit.  You've tried to quit.  It's     11:44
6      too hard.  Go to these safer cigarettes.  These      11:44
7      filters will take out stuff.  These low tars won't   11:44
8      give you as much chemicals.                          11:44
9           It's a lie.  It was a lie.  Clearly, their      11:44
10      conspiracy and their concealment was a legal cause   11:44
11      of why Bert Ramsay died.  Without it, he wouldn't    11:44
12      have. 11:44
13           That continued over into the 1980s with that    11:44
14      open debate campaign.  It continued over into the    11:44
15      1980s with the Vantage advertising.                  11:44
16           I want to remind you just a couple of moments   11:45
17      of some of the testimony you heard, and then I'm     11:45
18      going to wrap it up soon.                            11:45
19           Dr. Cummings.  Mr. Ramsay was a model case of   11:45
20      the success of the industry's public relations       11:45
21      efforts giving smokers a psychological crutch and    11:45
22      self rationale to keep smoking.                      11:45
23           He went from unfiltered to filtered             11:45
24      cigarettes, from filtered cigarettes to low-tar      11:45
25      cigarettes, just as the internal business records    11:45

1      of the defendants in this case wanted.  He was a     11:45
2      success case in their view.                          11:45
3           That's what Dr. Cummings testified to the       11:45
4      other day right before he was finished.              11:45
5           Dr. Henningfield.  From a public health         11:45
6      perspective, the problem was they created the        11:45
7      illusion of a safer cigarette.  I know the federal   11:45
8      scientists were as bamboozled as I was when I        11:46
9      started my research in the late '70s.  We thought    11:46
10      less was less.  We didn't know that smokers were     11:46
11      not getting significantly less.                      11:46
12           When Dr. Raffa finished testifying yesterday    11:46
13      morning, that chair was empty.  Somebody from the    11:46
14      tobacco companies could have came and told you       11:46
15      whether or not all the information Dr. Cummings and  11:46
16      Dr. Henningfield said --                             11:46
17           MR. WALKER:  Objection, your Honor.             11:46
18           THE COURT:  Come up for a second.               11:46
19           (A discussion is had on the record at sidebar   11:48
20 as follows: 11:48
21           THE COURT:  Thank you.                          11:48
22           MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I object to this       11:48
23      argument asking the jury to draw some sort of an     11:48
24      inference from the fact that a witness wasn't        11:48
25      called to testify.  It's not an appropriate          11:48

1      argument under the case law.                         11:48
2           MR. CLARK:  It's fair comment to comment on     11:48
3      the fact that a party doesn't show up and explain a  11:48
4      material issue.  We have case law on that.           11:48
5           It's not fair comment to comment on a witness   11:48
6      who is equally available to the -- to both sides.    11:48
7           But it is definitely fair comment to comment    11:48
8      on the fact that a party doesn't show up and say     11:48
9      something.  11:48
10           THE COURT:  Yeah.  Equal availability, I        11:48
11      thought, was the test.  This is always               11:48
12      uncomfortable.  But I think that's the test, is      11:48
13      someone equally available.                           11:48
14           MR. WALKER:  He's talking about Reynolds'       11:48
15      scientists.  They are equally available to them.     11:48
16      There's testimony that they designated people on     11:48
17      the witness list, I think they could have called.    11:48
18           They didn't call a scientist from Reynolds to   11:48
19      address these issues.  So I mean, there's some       11:48
20      cases.  There are plaintiffs who put testimony in    11:48
21      they took on behalf of the scientist, whether it     11:48
22      was Philip Morris or anyone else.                    11:48
23           THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, if the argument is     11:48
24      that someone wasn't called to rebut something, I     11:48
25      think that's probably fair game.  I understand, and  11:48

1      I think we've got the record.  We'll overrule the    11:48
2      objection.  11:48
3           (The sidebar discussion was concluded.)         11:48
4           MR. CLARK:  Like I was saying.  Somebody from   11:49
5      R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris could have came and   11:49
6      sat in that seat and told you that what              11:49
7      Dr. Cummings said wasn't accurate.                   11:49
8           Somebody could have came and told you that      11:49
9      these design features that Dr. Henningfield talked   11:49
10      about, the vent holes and the overwrap, the burn     11:49
11      accelerants and how they affect smoking, they could  11:49
12      have came and told you that wasn't what they were    11:49
13      doing. 11:49
14           But you didn't get any of that.  Not a single   11:49
15      word.  All you got was a bunch of articles about     11:49
16      what Mr. Ramsay may have known.                      11:49
17           The questions are kind of similar, the          11:49
18      conspiracy and the concealment questions.  So the    11:49
19      answer is clearly yes.  Their lies, their deceit,    11:49
20      and their cover-up caused Bert Ramsay's cancer and   11:49
21      death.  They couldn't have done it alone.  The       11:49
22      companies had to work together.  That's your         11:49
23      conspiracy. 11:49
24           The only other question I want to talk about    11:49
25      on the verdict form is the question of               11:49

1      responsibility and fault.                            11:49
2           After you get done with those questions,        11:49
3      you'll be asked to assess how much Mr. Ramsay's at   11:49
4      fault, how much is R.J. Reynolds at fault, how much  11:49
5      is Philip Morris at fault for causing this.          11:50
6           And you've heard, we've admitted that           11:50
7      Mr. Ramsay bears some responsibility.  Tried to      11:50
8      quit smoking.  Could have done it more.  Could have  11:50
9      done it better, could have tried harder.  He's got   11:50
10      some fault in this, no doubt.                        11:50
11           But they've got more.  They've got more         11:50
12      because their superior knowledge, their              11:50
13      advantageous position, and their lies and deceit is  11:50
14      what led him to this.                                11:50
15           So what you have is you have several entities   11:50
16      that you've been presented with.  You've been        11:50
17      presented with R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, CTR,    11:50
18      and the Tobacco Institute.  And then you have Bert   11:50
19      Ramsay. 11:50
20           So the total has to equal a hundred percent.    11:50
21      So the only fair way I see it is give everybody      11:50
22      20 percent.  20 percent to Mr. Ramsay, 20 percent    11:50
23      to R.J. Reynolds, 20 percent to Philip Morris, but   11:50
24      they're responsible for the conduct of CTR and TI    11:50
25      because that was their organizations so they got to  11:50

1      bear that 20 percent on each one of them as well.    11:51
2           So I think a fair amount here would be          11:51
3      40 percent for Reynolds, 40 percent for Philip       11:51
4      Morris, and 20 percent for Mr. Ramsay.               11:51
5           MS. CHERRY:  You have 55 minutes, Mr. Clark.    11:51
6           MR. CLARK:  Thank you.                          11:51
7           From that Frank Statement, back in 1954, they   11:51
8      made promises they never intended to keep.  They     11:51
9      attacked the Surgeon General.  They put profits      11:51
10      over people.  And for the next 39 years that         11:51
11      Mr. Ramsay lived, they duped him, the public health  11:51
12      community, and the government, and anyone else who   11:51
13      dared to speak the truth.                            11:51
14           These witnesses testified a lot.  You heard     11:51
15      about all the different trials, how many trials      11:51
16      they've been testifying in.  And you heard them      11:51
17      talk about why they do it.  Dr. Henningfield told    11:51
18      you, this is a way I can get the truth out.  This    11:52
19      is how I can educate people on what's going on.      11:52
20           I bet none of you in here knew, coming into     11:52
21      this courtroom two weeks ago, what you know now.     11:52
22      And Dr. Henningfield and Dr. Cummings told you that  11:52
23      20, 30, 40 years ago, they didn't know it either.    11:52
24      But yet Mr. Ramsay somehow is supposed to be blamed  11:52
25      for what he did.                                     11:52

1           The choices made were mostly theirs.  I'm       11:52
2      going to sit down now and let Mr. Berg have a few    11:52
3      minutes.  But I thank you for listening to me.  And  11:52
4      you won't have to hear me anymore.  I'm all done.    11:52
5      Thank you.  11:52
6           Thank you, your Honor.                          11:52


10                     CLOSING ARGUMENT                      11:53
11           MR. BERG:  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to      11:53
12      thank you on behalf of not just myself and           11:53
13      Mr. Clark, but Ms. Bishop.  I think all the lawyers  11:53
14      in this room are going to tell you that you've been  11:53
15      one of the most attentive, question/answer asking    11:53
16      juries that we've ever had the pleasure to try a     11:53
17      case in front of.                                    11:53
18           We know you've been engaged.  You've been       11:53
19      listening carefully, thinking about these issues,    11:53
20      and obviously trying to do the right thing in this   11:53
21      case. 11:53
22           You know, we've got this huge sign up here in   11:53
23      this beautiful courtroom about equal justice under   11:53
24      the law.  And that phrase is used in other           11:53
25      countries.  It's on other courtrooms.  But they      11:53

1      make fun of it in other countries.  The citizens     11:53
2      laugh about that because it's a joke.                11:53
3           But in our country, we take it seriously.       11:53
4      Jurors like yourselves take it seriously, that they  11:54
5      come into a courtroom, there's no special interest,  11:54
6      there's a level playing field.  We listen to the     11:54
7      evidence and have people from all walks of life      11:54
8      come together and come up with the right decision    11:54
9      and do justice under the law.                        11:54
10           And so in this case, we're going to ask that    11:54
11      you, as this jury, stand up to these corporations,   11:54
12      to these companies, these tobacco companies, and     11:54
13      tell them with your verdict that we're not going to  11:54
14      tolerate, we're not going to stand for intentional   11:54
15      misconduct that destroys lives, that destroys        11:54
16      families. 11:54
17           You've heard about the 20 million families and  11:55
18      individuals that have been killed by these           11:55
19      products.  And I want to get to it in a minute.      11:55
20      But I want to touch on one other thing first that    11:55
21      came up because, you know, we put on six days of     11:55
22      evidence of some of the most world-renowned          11:55
23      scientists and experts in these fields for you to    11:55
24      listen to, ask questions of, and testify.            11:55
25           And what we got from these two defendants was   11:55

1      a two-minute clip out of two full days of            11:55
2      deposition testimony of Ms. Bishop.  That -- and     11:55
3      that was it.  That's their rebuttal to the evidence  11:55
4      that you've heard.                                   11:55
5           We know that they have the capability to find   11:56
6      experts, to bring in qualified scientists --         11:56
7           MR. WALKER:  Objection, your Honor.             11:56
8           THE COURT:  Sustained.  Can you just move on.   11:56
9           MR. BERG:  So I want to talk about what that    11:56
10      clip showed because that clip -- you heard a little  11:56
11      bit about this before, but that clip is really       11:56
12      important to the plaintiff's case in this matter.    11:56
13      I want to talk about it for a minute.                11:56
14           This collapsed lung -- and there's been a lot   11:56
15      of questions, a lot of discussion, a lot of          11:56
16      testimony about it.  The collapsed lung is a         11:56
17      critical piece of evidence in this whole case.       11:56
18           It frames this case because what it tells us    11:56
19      is that Ms. Bishop, the reason she was upset with    11:56
20      the doctor at the time was because whether it was    11:57
21      caused by smoking or not, she wanted him to tell     11:57
22      her husband that it was caused by smoking.  She      11:57
23      wanted there to be no doubt in Mr. Ramsay's mind     11:57
24      that smoking caused that collapsed lung, even if it  11:57
25      didn't, so that he would quit.                       11:57

1           And why do we know that that is so true and so  11:57
2      powerful?  Because the evidence in this case, the    11:57
3      evidence that these defendants did for 50 years was  11:57
4      create doubt.  Was create uncertainty.  Was create   11:57
5      a rationale for a smoker to keep smoking.  The       11:57
6      whisper in the ear of, you can switch, you don't     11:58
7      have to quit, you're not going to die next week or   11:58
8      next month or next year.                             11:58
9           They created the rationalization and denial     11:58
10      that addicted people cling to.  It's not a           11:58
11      character flaw to be addicted.  But they cling to    11:58
12      that self rationale, that rationalization.           11:58
13           And what addicted people need is certainty.     11:58
14      They need the information that tells them, you're    11:58
15      at rock bottom, or there's no doubt you're going to  11:58
16      die, or there's no doubt you're going to lose your   11:58
17      relationships or your life.                          11:58
18           They need that to motivate to quit, to execute  11:59
19      on the quits, to follow through on the quits.        11:59
20           And that's why she wanted so badly for that     11:59
21      doctor to look him in the eye and say, what you      11:59
22      just went through felt like a heart attack, you're   11:59
23      in the hospital for two weeks while a tube's in      11:59
24      your lung reinflating it, that's from smoking,       11:59
25      Mr. Ramsay.  She wanted that to be crystal clear.    11:59

1      No doubt, no self rationale, no denial, no           11:59
2      rationalization.                                     11:59
3           And what do we know about his addiction?  That  11:59
4      the minute the doctor did not say those things, he   11:59
5      went right back.  He went right back.  He relapsed.  12:00
6      And you've heard that that's part of addiction,      12:00
7      relapsing, even in the face of harmful               12:00
8      consequences. 12:00
9           Now, since this case is about Bert Ramsay and   12:00
10      about his wife, let's talk for a minute about him.   12:00
11      Because you heard nothing bad about Bert Ramsay in   12:00
12      this case.  12:00
13           He was a good student, worked hard at it,       12:00
14      finished college, went into the military, served     12:00
15      admirably, stood face to face with                   12:01
16      President Kennedy presenting the troops, went to     12:01
17      work for a corporation that he spent his entire      12:01
18      career at, that he was loyal to, that he was the     12:01
19      kind of father that all the evidence you heard in    12:01
20      this case was they ate meals together, they did      12:01
21      things together, they went on vacations together.    12:01
22      They had a model family, loving, supporting.         12:01
23           You heard the pain from daughter, Jennifer,     12:01
24      just thinking back about witnessing some             12:01
25      lighthearted dancing in the kitchen, I think she     12:01

1      was talking about, with her mom and dad as she       12:01
2      would see kind of from a distance, and those images  12:01
3      and memories of them and their relationship.         12:02
4           He was a good friend to people, like Mike       12:02
5      Criscitiello, and others.  And although they         12:02
6      relocated a number of times, they uprooted from      12:02
7      their friends that they had developed, Annie Bishop  12:02
8      and Mr. Ramsay, they always had each other.  They    12:02
9      had each other.  They were best friends.  They       12:02
10      talked about everything.  They did things together.  12:02
11           You heard from Jennifer about how she saw her   12:02
12      mother kind of lose her spark after Mr. Ramsay's     12:02
13      death.  You know, his -- Bert Ramsay's life          12:02
14      mattered.  It mattered to Annie.  It mattered to     12:03
15      his family and friends.  And it mattered in the      12:03
16      same way that 20 million other deaths caused by      12:03
17      smoking mattered to their families.                  12:03
18           So what was the evidence about Bert Ramsay's    12:03
19      character?  Again, nothing bad or unfavorable.  He   12:03
20      did the right things.  He played by all the rules.   12:03
21      Played by all the rules to do the right thing.       12:03
22           But what about the character of R.J. Reynolds   12:03
23      and Philip Morris?  You know, your parents and your  12:03
24      teachers and your pastors, they tell you that        12:04
25      character is what you do when no one's watching.     12:04

1           MR. WALKER:  Objection, your Honor.             12:04
2           THE COURT:  Overruled.                          12:04
3           Please continue.                                12:04
4           MR. BERG:  And what did these companies do      12:04
5      when they didn't think anybody was watching?  Was    12:04
6      it -- what was it that they were doing in secret?    12:04
7      Because that's where they were telling the truth to  12:04
8      each other.  Not what they were going to tell to     12:04
9      the public.  But we know the truth was coming out    12:04
10      in their secret, confidential memos and discussions  12:04
11      going on. 12:04
12           And that's the nature of the character of       12:04
13      these defendants.  They want to be, and the law      12:04
14      treats them as people.  Not corporations, as         12:04
15      people.  The same rights, the same obligations.      12:04
16           There's a lot of information you see and a lot  12:05
17      that you're going to see in the documents and the    12:05
18      records.  And you're going to have to ask yourself,  12:05
19      is there anything that you've been shown that shows  12:05
20      any kind of concern on the part of these defendants  12:05
21      for the American public?  Any concern for the        12:05
22      health and safety of any of their own customers,     12:05
23      people like Bert Ramsay?                             12:05
24           And in his openings statements, Mr. Walker,     12:05
25      and I'm sure in his closing, will say things to you  12:05

1      like, when Bert Ramsay was motivated to quit, he     12:05
2      quit. 12:06
3           And my question to you is:  When were these     12:06
4      men of tobacco, when were they motivated to quit?    12:06
5      Motivated to quit lying to the public about the      12:06
6      relationship between lung cancer and smoking?        12:06
7      Motivated to quit about the addictiveness of         12:06
8      nicotine that they knew about and hid from the       12:06
9      public?  Motivated to quit this 50-year conspiracy   12:06
10      from which none of them broke ranks, that killed     12:06
11      20 million of their best customers for using the     12:06
12      product exactly the way they intended it to be       12:06
13      used. 12:06
14           So your verdict can't bring Bert Ramsay back.   12:07
15      And the time for sympathy and apologies is long      12:07
16      gone.  So we're here in this courtroom.  There's no  12:07
17      surprise.  We've talked about it from the            12:07
18      beginning.  You understand that this case is about   12:07
19      what drove these two corporations and others all     12:07
20      those years.  What they made every decision based    12:07
21      on, and that was profits, money.  And today, under   12:07
22      our system, the only way for your verdict to do      12:07
23      justice in this case is to award money damages.      12:07
24           Now, again, the unrebutted testimony that you   12:07
25      heard from the economist, Dr. Raffa -- and like any  12:07

1      of the testimony, you decide, you heard, you may     12:08
2      think that there's things that weren't properly      12:08
3      considered or that should be looked at differently.  12:08
4           But his testimony was that there were several   12:08
5      levels, and he talked about the support and the      12:08
6      services, the net accumulations that were losses to  12:08
7      Ms. Bishop. 12:08
8           And you may recall that his -- his numbers      12:08
9      were for the present value of the loss of support    12:08
10      that she would have received.  Again, Bert Ramsay,   12:08
11      he had really gone up the chain.  He was making a    12:08
12      good living. 12:08
13           And so the amount of money that the evidence    12:09
14      has shown that would have been the present value,    12:09
15      this is minus the pension that she was entitled to   12:09
16      that you heard about for loss of support to her,     12:09
17      was $792,716.  And then the loss of services to her  12:09
18      was $123,055. 12:09
19           And then in addition, he talked about the net   12:09
20      accumulations to the estate.  And that was the       12:09
21      amount that, after they had spent for various        12:09
22      living expenses, approximately 70 percent of the     12:09
23      income that he made, that there would be this        12:09
24      remainder that would be the savings expected over    12:09
25      the course of his life.                              12:09

1           And so that figure of the net accumulations to  12:09
2      the estate was $778,623.                             12:09
3           The total was $1,694,394.                       12:10
4           And that's a significant figure.  That's a      12:10
5      significant figure.  And on your verdict form,       12:10
6      you'll see there are questions eight and nine,       12:10
7      those are the net accumulations, and then the        12:10
8      support and services figures.  And actually, that    12:10
9      support and services is added together.  So that     12:10
10      figure of the $792,716 plus the $123,055, that       12:10
11      total which would be on that line, number nine, on   12:10
12      the verdict form, is $915,771.                       12:10
13           But despite the significance of that, the       12:11
14      human loss, the human loss in this case, which goes  12:11
15      to the next question, to the amount of damages       12:11
16      sustained by Annie Bishop for the loss of her        12:11
17      husband's companionship, for her pain and suffering  12:11
18      as a result of Robert Ramsay's injury and death,     12:11
19      that's significant too.  That is significant too.    12:11
20           And there's no exact figures for that.          12:11
21      There's no precise calculations.  It's evidence      12:11
22      that you, as the jury, decide is fair and just in    12:11
23      light of all the evidence.  And that's the           12:11
24      instructions that you heard.                         12:11
25           So you're going to have to struggle through     12:11

1      that question on your own to try to figure out what  12:11
2      you think is fair and reasonable.                    12:11
3           We can give suggestions or suggest what we      12:12
4      think the evidence has shown in relation to the      12:12
5      amount of the economic damages.  We're suggesting    12:12
6      that the figure for her loss of companionship, and   12:12
7      pain and suffering for these past 22 years should    12:12
8      be $5 million.  And that the evidence supports       12:12
9      that. 12:12
10           If you think that's too high, then you adjust   12:12
11      it accordingly.  If you think it's too low, you      12:12
12      adjust it accordingly.  That decision is yours to    12:12
13      make. 12:12
14           Because you're going to have to ask, what's it  12:12
15      worth to lose your best friend, what's it worth to   12:12
16      lose the father that you see interact with your      12:12
17      children, who were in their twenties at the time,    12:12
18      what's the value and what's the worth of seeing and  12:12
19      experiencing the death, not having the interaction   12:13
20      with the grandchildren that you've heard about and   12:13
21      seen in this case.  What's it worth to lose your     12:13
22      husband, the only man that you've been with since    12:13
23      you were 17 years old, 31 years, and he -- they      12:13
24      were both just 51 when he died.                      12:13
25           MS. CHERRY:  You're at 20 minutes, Mr. Berg.    12:13

1           MR. BERG:  Thank you.                           12:13
2           What's it worth to have your lasting images     12:13
3      seared in your head of your son carrying your        12:13
4      husband because he can't walk, his body's ravaged    12:13
5      by cancer, and those final days and months and how   12:13
6      quickly he went.                                     12:13
7           Finally, you're going to be asked in this       12:14
8      case, on the final question, to determine whether    12:14
9      punitive damages are warranted in this case.         12:14
10      Damages that are meant specifically to punish the    12:14
11      actions, the conduct, the behavior of these two      12:14
12      defendants.  And that's question number 11.          12:14
13           You heard the instructions for that.  And       12:14
14      what's interesting about those instructions on the   12:14
15      punitive damages is that you're asked to consider,   12:14
16      by the clear and convincing evidence, that did       12:14
17      their conduct -- and I'm not reading the entirety    12:14
18      of this, so rely on the instructions that you have   12:15
19      with you or will be provided to you.  But that       12:15
20      show, number one, a reckless disregard of human      12:15
21      life or the safety of persons.  They obviously did   12:15
22      that, the evidence has shown.                        12:15
23           Number two, that their conduct has been         12:15
24      consciously indifferent to the consequences.  That   12:15
25      is certainly true.                                   12:15

1           Number three, their conduct has wantonly or     12:15
2      recklessly disregarded the safety and welfare of     12:15
3      the public.  We know from the evidence that that's   12:15
4      proven by the clear and convincing evidence.         12:15
5           And number four, that the conduct showed such   12:15
6      reckless indifference to the rights of others as to  12:15
7      be the equivalent to an intentional violation of     12:15
8      those -- those rights.                               12:15
9           You'll see in that -- in that series of         12:15
10      questions that between each of those four is --      12:16
11      four elements is the word "or."  You only have to    12:16
12      decide that the clear and convincing evidence        12:16
13      established one of those things.  And it's clear     12:16
14      that all four have been met in this case.            12:16
15           And in conclusion, these -- these defendants,   12:16
16      they did what they did knowing that people were      12:16
17      going to die, that people were dying, and they kept  12:16
18      on doing it.  And that is the kind of conduct that   12:16
19      warrants punitive damages in a way to punish them    12:17
20      and to deter others.                                 12:17
21           So in this courtroom, ladies and gentlemen,     12:17
22      you have the power.  You have the power to right a   12:17
23      wrong.  You have the power to tell these two         12:17
24      defendants that that type of conduct isn't going to  12:17
25      be tolerated. 12:17

1           And so we would suggest to you, as I asked you  12:17
2      in opening, that it's a case about truth and what    12:17
3      these defendants did to the truth.  And it's a case  12:17
4      about consequences.  And we're asking that they      12:17
5      face those consequences today with your verdict.     12:17
6           Thank you.                                      12:18


17          MR. BERG:  Thank you, Your Honor.               15:43:07
18          I was -- I was interested to see that           15:43:09
19     photograph with the fork in the road because I think 15:43:15
20     it made clear in this case what you've heard about   15:43:19
21     the fork in the road that the tobacco companies had  15:43:23
22     the choice about back in 1953.                       15:43:27
23          Back in 1953, when there was the cancer scare   15:43:30
24     came out and they all locked arms and went to the    15:43:35
25     Plaza Hotel, where they began this 50-year           15:43:38

1     conspiracy, it was at that point where they could    15:43:43
2     have taken the right direction.  They could have     15:43:46
3     taken the direction of being upfront, telling the    15:43:49
4     truth, disclosing the information that they already  15:43:53
5     knew about, and that they were learning about, or    15:43:56
6     they could take the road that they chose.            15:43:59
7          And they took the road to conceal, to lie, to   15:44:02
8     create this cover-up and conspiracy that would last  15:44:08
9     for the next 50 years.                               15:44:12
10          Mr. Walker made a lot of comments about         15:44:16
11     specific things that the tobacco companies did not   15:44:19
12     say.  And yet, this case is equally about the        15:44:22
13     omissions, the things they didn't say that they knew 15:44:32
14     about. 15:44:33
15          So, they knew that smoking caused lung cancer.  15:44:34
16     And they made a conscious effort to create doubt     15:44:40
17     about that, to never really completely deny it:      15:44:46
18     Possibly we'll look into it, it needs more research, 15:44:51
19     we're not really sure, we're going to try to find    15:44:55
20     out.  15:44:58
21          Did they know that nicotine was addictive early 15:45:02
22     on?  Yes, they did.  And no, they didn't come out    15:45:06
23     and say nicotine's not addictive.  But they knew it  15:45:10
24     was addictive and they never came out and told the   15:45:15
25     American public when they knew that it was.          15:45:18

1          What could have happened?  What could have      15:45:22
2     happened if they had done that simple thing:  Tell   15:45:27
3     the truth about the addictiveness of nicotine back   15:45:31
4     in the early 60s, late '50s, when they knew about    15:45:36
5     these things? 15:45:40
6          We've already seen what the modern markets do.  15:45:41
7     What modern medicine has done with patches and       15:45:47
8     lozenges and nasal sprays and other -- Chantix and   15:45:51
9     Wellbutrin and dependency clinics.  We've already    15:45:57
10     seen those things come into being that have given a  15:46:02
11     lot of addicted smokers the ability to quit.         15:46:05
12          The ability to say, hey, it's not just me, it's 15:46:09
13     not just a character flaw, that I can't quit.  I     15:46:12
14     know I can't quit, but now that people would learn   15:46:17
15     that it's an addictive substance, that it's          15:46:22
16     addictive like heroin or like cocaine and that       15:46:26
17     you've got to treat it in that way, you've got to    15:46:29
18     treat getting off of it, with some people, like      15:46:33
19     Mr. Ramsay, you've got to treat it in that kind of   15:46:37
20     way that you would treat another addictive           15:46:40
21     substance.  15:46:43
22          And so instead of -- you've seen these graphs   15:46:44
23     of the consumption chart and the cancer chart.  So   15:46:48
24     instead of that chart, that graph, just escalating,  15:46:54
25     escalating and escalating and then does it turn.     15:47:01

1     You've all seen it come back down.                   15:47:04
2          You've seen it come back down.                  15:47:07
3          Why does it come back down?  It's come back     15:47:09
4     down for several reasons.  One is, a lot of the      15:47:13
5     people of Burt Ramsay's era -- we've talked about    15:47:16
6     this -- where smoking was everywhere, three out of   15:47:21
7     four men of his era were smokers.  So we're finding  15:47:24
8     that as it goes up, that era, those people are       15:47:30
9     dying.  And so there's some decrease related to      15:47:36
10     that. 15:47:39
11          There's some decrease based on modern medicine  15:47:39
12     and what's happening in terms of nicotine            15:47:42
13     replacement and therapies that way.                  15:47:46
14          But probably the most important thing is -- is  15:47:49
15     as we sit here in 2014, people know, they know what  15:47:53
16     the problem with cigarettes is.  There's no          15:48:02
17     ambiguity about it.  There's no doubt, no            15:48:05
18     uncertainty, people in this era know about the       15:48:10
19     addictiveness and they know about the                15:48:14
20     disease-causing manner of -- of smoking.             15:48:18
21          So with all that and with that knowledge, that  15:48:24
22     graph is coming back down.  It's coming back down.   15:48:27
23     And that could have happened 50 years earlier.       15:48:31
24     Fifty years. 15:48:35
25          And, yeah, Mr. Walker's upset that I've said 20 15:48:35

1     million people.  Well, that's 20 million folks with  15:48:39
2     hopes and dreams and aspirations just like -- just   15:48:46
3     like Mr. Ramsay.  They're not just points on a       15:48:52
4     graph.  They're not just statistics for the tobacco  15:48:55
5     companies to keep track of.  They're real human      15:48:57
6     beings. 15:49:00
7          And if we're doing this 50 years earlier,       15:49:00
8     that's a lot of American lives, a lot of American    15:49:06
9     families that are saved.                             15:49:10
10          Now, Mr. Walker got up here, I thought they     15:49:13
11     must not have ever cross-examined any of our         15:49:22
12     witnesses that we put up there the way he was        15:49:24
13     talking.  If they thought Dr. Villa was such a great 15:49:26
14     witness, which, of course, he was, why were they so  15:49:31
15     determined to try to cross-examine him and get him   15:49:35
16     to say things that smoking didn't cause the lung     15:49:39
17     cancer; that it wasn't primary; that he didn't have  15:49:43
18     this information; that he didn't do an autopsy, et   15:49:46
19     cetera? 15:49:46
20          But why didn't they just come in here and say,  15:49:51
21     of course smoking caused his lung cancer.  We're not 15:49:54
22     contesting that.                                     15:49:59
23          But no, they had to spend their 45 minutes      15:50:00
24     pulling out other depositions and parsing words with 15:50:05
25     Dr. Villa when it was obvious that Dr. Villa was     15:50:09

1     saying, without any doubt, this gentleman has        15:50:13
2     primary lung cancer, it's caused by smoking, and     15:50:19
3     that's the cause of his death.                       15:50:24
4          Period, end of story on that.                   15:50:25
5          But no, we didn't get that.                     15:50:28
6          And then now Dr. Hurt is all of a sudden --     15:50:30
7     they're going to pull out some words from his        15:50:33
8     testimony to suggest that somehow he supports their  15:50:35
9     arguments in this case?                              15:50:41
10          Dr. Hurt testified that Mr. Ramsay was severely 15:50:43
11     addicted.  There was no question about that.  That   15:50:48
12     he looked at him with all the evidence, all the      15:50:54
13     deposition transcripts, all the medical records,     15:50:58
14     based on his 25 years at the Mayo Clinic and the     15:51:02
15     tobacco dependency aspect.  Hundreds and hundreds of 15:51:09
16     peer-reviewed articles and lectures in public health 15:51:12
17     on smoking and tobacco cessation.                    15:51:15
18          He talked about that heaviness of smoking       15:51:24
19     index.  He said, that's not the only thing I looked  15:51:26
20     at.  That's not the only thing I based it on.  But   15:51:28
21     if I was to use one test, if I had to, if there was  15:51:34
22     one test to determine addiction, that's the best     15:51:41
23     one.  That's the one that they teach medical doctors 15:51:44
24     to use.  They teach referring doctors to use.  They  15:51:48
25     teach their own consultants at the Mayo Clinic to    15:51:52

1     use.  15:51:57
2          So that is a -- a test, but it's not the only   15:51:58
3     thing. 15:52:03
4          You heard him talk about the quit attempts.     15:52:04
5     You heard him talk about some spontaneous            15:52:07
6     pneumothorax and what that meant as far as addiction 15:52:11
7     and how clear that was for addiction.                15:52:14
8          He doesn't say that the minute the nicotine is  15:52:19
9     physically half-lifed out of your body that all of a 15:52:26
10     sudden the nicotine-addicted smoker has no more      15:52:30
11     desire, has no more relapsability to go back to      15:52:35
12     smoking. 15:52:39
13          He said nothing like that.                      15:52:41
14          He talked about the cravings, the triggers, the 15:52:44
15     cues, to return and to relapse are there for months  15:52:47
16     and even years with some people.  But at least       15:52:54
17     months. 15:52:57
18          And so that's -- that's a very powerful         15:52:58
19     indication of -- of the power that nicotine held     15:53:04
20     over this gentleman; that he could return.  That he  15:53:07
21     would risk his own health; that he would risk or     15:53:12
22     somehow self-deny, rationalize, whatever words we    15:53:16
23     want to call it, somehow his family in order to      15:53:21
24     return to nicotine.                                  15:53:26
25          That was a clear indication of his addiction.   15:53:30

1          Now, on that first question, about addiction,   15:53:34
2     there's no question there about whether he could     15:53:39
3     have quit, should have quit.  Is it fault?  Might    15:53:42
4     have been at fault, any of that.  That comes later   15:53:46
5     on the verdict form.                                 15:53:49
6          That question about allocation of fault comes   15:53:49
7     later down on the verdict form.  In that first       15:53:53
8     question, that's not part of the question.           15:53:56
9          It is simply:  Was he addicted to nicotine in   15:53:59
10     the cigarettes, and was that a legal cause of his    15:54:05
11     lung cancer and death?  Was it a substantial         15:54:08
12     contributing cause, his addiction?  And not an       15:54:10
13     insignificant cause?                                 15:54:21
14          Was it something that substantially contributed 15:54:21
15     to him continuing to smoke and develop the lung      15:54:22
16     cancer? 15:54:22
17          And all the evidence in the case, all the       15:54:26
18     testimony that you heard, all of it said "Yes" to    15:54:28
19     that question. 15:54:33
20          There's nothing other than their implication,   15:54:34
21     their speculation on the other side that he wasn't   15:54:37
22     addicted.  All the testimony from the witnesses is   15:54:40
23     that he was hooked; that he couldn't stop; that he   15:54:45
24     couldn't quit; all the language of addiction.        15:54:50
25     Dr. Hurt, Dr. Henningfield, there -- there was       15:54:53

1     nothing in rebuttal to that.                         15:54:59
2          So that -- that first question is clear.        15:55:01
3     That's unambiguous; that he was addicted and that    15:55:06
4     that was a legal cause.                              15:55:10
5          Now, if you want to decide later on -- and      15:55:12
6     we've admitted that he bears responsibility, bears   15:55:15
7     some responsibility.  And we haven't shirked from    15:55:18
8     that at all.  It's shared responsibility.            15:55:22
9          So if you want to answer that question down     15:55:27
10     below, then that's where that's appropriate to       15:55:32
11     address that. 15:55:36
12          The other thing that Mr. Walker talked about    15:55:37
13     was -- and you're going to see this.  You're going   15:55:42
14     to see these Engle findings again, and what's --     15:55:59
15     what's important about these is that when you answer 15:56:02
16     the question on addiction, when you answer that      15:56:08
17     first question, that he was addicted and it was the  15:56:11
18     legal cause, when you answer that question "Yes,"    15:56:18
19     these findings have already been determined.         15:56:22
20     They've already been determined.                     15:56:26
21          Now, Mr. Walker spent an hour up here talking   15:56:28
22     about bits and pieces of different conduct,          15:56:32
23     suggesting that their conduct really wasn't that     15:56:38
24     bad; really wasn't negligent; really wasn't          15:56:42
25     concealing; wasn't fraudulent.                       15:56:49

1          But the problem with that, ladies and           15:56:50
2     gentlemen, is that the Engle findings have already   15:56:54
3     determined this.  If this was a year-long trial      15:56:56
4     where you -- they heard more evidence than anything  15:56:59
5     compared to what this is --                          15:57:01
6          MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.             15:57:02
7          THE COURT:  Hold on one second.  Sustained.     15:57:04
8          MR. BERG:  You're going to get all this         15:57:07
9     evidence in the case.  Please look through it        15:57:08
10     carefully.  There's a lot there.  The Surgeon        15:57:11
11     General Reports in their entirety are there to be    15:57:14
12     looked at.  All these different records from which   15:57:17
13     pieces have -- have been shown for benefit of time,  15:57:21
14     they're all in there.                                15:57:25
15          Go through those records carefully, carefully   15:57:27
16     yourself.  Take the time to look at them and see     15:57:31
17     what they have to say.                               15:57:34
18          But these Engle findings have already been      15:57:35
19     established.  And the first couple we've talked      15:57:37
20     about and so there's not much issue at all.          15:57:43
21          No. 3:  The finding is, "R.J. Reynolds and      15:57:46
22     Philip Morris were negligent."  So we know that's    15:57:49
23     been established.                                    15:57:53
24          No. 4:  "R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris placed 15:57:54
25     cigarettes on the market that were defective and     15:57:58

1     unreasonably dangerous."  That's established.        15:58:00
2          No. 5:  "R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris        15:58:04
3     concealed or omitted material information not        15:58:08
4     otherwise known or available, knowing that the       15:58:12
5     material was false and misleading, or failed to      15:58:17
6     disclose a material fact concerning the health       15:58:20
7     effects and/or addictive nature of smoking           15:58:25
8     cigarettes." 15:58:29
9          So we're being told this as having been         15:58:30
10     determined that they concealed and omitted material  15:58:33
11     information that wasn't otherwise known to the       15:58:39
12     public or to Burt Ramsay, and that's been determined 15:58:44
13     by the Engle findings that you've been instructed    15:58:47
14     with the answer to Burt Ramsay being a class member. 15:58:50
15          MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.             15:58:54
16          THE COURT:  Hold on one second.                 15:58:54
17          MR. WALKER:  Objection.                         15:58:56
18          THE COURT:  Overruled.                          15:58:58
19          MR. BERG:  And then No. 6:  "That R.J. Reynolds 15:59:02
20     and Philip Morris entered into an agreement to       15:59:04
21     conceal or omit information regarding the health     15:59:08
22     effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with 15:59:11
23     the intention that smokers and the public would rely 15:59:14
24     on this information to their detriment."             15:59:18
25          Again, these matters are all established        15:59:21

1     already in this case once you find class membership. 15:59:27
2          Mr. Walker spent quite a bit of time attacking  15:59:38
3     the public health experts that came and testified in 15:59:56
4     this trial, attacking Dr. Henningfield, who you      16:00:02
5     remember did the cigarette dissection.               16:00:07
6          Attacking Dr. Cummings, attacking Dr. Hurt.     16:00:09
7     And, you know, this -- these defendants, they spent  16:00:14
8     50 years attacking the public health community.      16:00:20
9          MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.             16:00:24
10          THE COURT:  Overruled.                          16:00:26
11          MR. WALKER:  (Inaudible).                       16:00:29
12          MR. BERG:  So we heard them go after these      16:00:33
13     people and impugn their integrity.  You know,        16:00:37
14     they're mercenaries, they're generals in the public  16:00:42
15     health war.  Well, if they're mercenaries, then we   16:00:48
16     need more mercenaries.  We need more folks looking   16:00:53
17     out for the public health of American citizens.      16:00:57
18          Quitting, like any addiction, quitting an       16:01:18
19     addiction doesn't mean you weren't addicted.  People 16:01:24
20     with addictions quit.  They're able to.  They do it, 16:01:30
21     they struggle to do it.  Some struggle more than     16:01:39
22     others.  But the fact that someone struggles and     16:01:42
23     tries and tries and ultimately quits is -- is now    16:01:44
24     being suggest ed that it -- if that happens, if they 16:01:50
25     do that, if they make those efforts and if they're   16:01:53

1     ultimately successful, that means they were never    16:01:56
2     addicted in the first place.                         16:01:58
3          You didn't hear anything like that in this      16:02:01
4     trial from any of these witnesses.  Nothing like     16:02:03
5     that, even close to the argument that if you're able 16:02:06
6     to quit, you're not addicted.                        16:02:11
7          Mr. Walker seems to feel that the evidence that 16:02:13
8     came from the witness stand about the brain of young 16:02:34
9     people of adolescent and how it's affected by drugs  16:02:39
10     such as nicotine, that somehow that meant that the   16:02:43
11     minute a person turns 18, they don't have those      16:02:47
12     changes anymore.                                     16:02:49
13          The minute they turn 21, they don't have those  16:02:50
14     changes anymore.                                     16:02:53
15          That's not what the evidence was.  The evidence 16:02:54
16     is the brain is still forming, and these drugs make  16:02:57
17     their changes in that time frame to teenagers and    16:03:01
18     kids and because of that, their addiction tends to   16:03:07
19     be more severe and long-lasting into adulthood.  Not 16:03:12
20     the minute they turn 18, all of a sudden it's a      16:03:16
21     brand-new ball game.  There's no witnesses or        16:03:19
22     testimony that said what he seems to be suggesting.  16:03:23
23          These -- these issues with the filters, and the 16:03:32
24     low tar, you were shown a statement from             16:03:45
25     Dr. Henningfield that Dr. Henningfield said -- his   16:03:47

1     testimony was, when he made that statement about low 16:03:53
2     tar or filtered being better in his opinion than     16:03:58
3     unfiltered, that was before he knew.  That was       16:04:04
4     before he knew.                                      16:04:08
5          So Mr. Walker's clipped out that testimony when 16:04:09
6     Dr. Henningfield said, that was before we got        16:04:15
7     millions of pages of documents that had previously   16:04:19
8     been secret in the late '90s.  And before that, we   16:04:23
9     thought maybe it was.  He was almost embarrassed     16:04:29
10     that he, as a significant member of the public       16:04:32
11     health community, had been bamboozled.  That was his 16:04:36
12     word.  He was truly embarrassed by the fact that the 16:04:40
13     public health community had been defrauded and       16:04:45
14     fooled in the same way that the American public had  16:04:49
15     been, in terms of filters and low tar.               16:04:53
16          So low tar.  Let's talk about that for a        16:04:56
17     minute.  What does -- what -- what does any          16:05:00
18     reasonable person think when the term "low tar"      16:05:02
19     comes out and it's used by the companies in the way  16:05:07
20     that it was used?  Is it anything other than it's    16:05:10
21     safer?  Is there any commonsense interpretation that 16:05:14
22     it's anything other than safer, wink, wink, whatever 16:05:18
23     you want to call it?                                 16:05:24
24          They were very careful.  They were very         16:05:25
25     specific not to say "safer," but what did they want  16:05:30

1     the American public to believe?  What did they want  16:05:35
2     the smoker to believe?                               16:05:39
3          That it was safer.  Safer to go that route than 16:05:41
4     to quit, safer to switch, go to the low tar; and     16:05:45
5     Mr. Ramsay, who was knowledgeable, well-read,        16:05:53
6     intelligent, he -- he tracked along with exactly     16:05:58
7     that model. 16:06:03
8          He was -- he was a success story of the tobacco 16:06:04
9     companies.  When filters came out, he went there.    16:06:08
10     When low tar came out, he went there.  When this     16:06:13
11     new-fangled filter that's on that Vantage ad, that   16:06:19
12     commercial, can that ad mean anything other than     16:06:24
13     that -- that they're representing that that filter   16:06:26
14     is somehow going to purify or take bad things out of 16:06:29
15     tobacco?  Can it have any other connotation to the   16:06:35
16     American public?  Of course not.                     16:06:39
17          It's meant to communicate more safe.            16:06:42
18          It's meant to communicate healthier.            16:06:45
19          And that's exactly what they did, for years and 16:06:49
20     years and years.                                     16:06:52
21          You know, they -- we saw a lot of Reader's      16:06:57
22     Digest in this trial.  But what was interesting to   16:07:12
23     me was that these executive officers of these        16:07:16
24     tobacco companies, they must have never read         16:07:22
25     Reader's Digest.  They must have never read those    16:07:24

1     articles, because every time they made a public      16:07:29
2     statement, every time they were in the press, on TV, 16:07:33
3     on a news show, asked about it, in response to the   16:07:39
4     public health, every single time, they said, it      16:07:42
5     doesn't cause cancer.  We're not aware of it being   16:07:47
6     addictive.  16:07:51
7          But the American public is supposed to know all 16:07:56
8     those things. 16:07:59
9          The American smoke -- smoker is supposed to     16:08:01
10     know all those things.                               16:08:04
11          Why would they spend 200 -- you know, these --  16:08:06
12     these companies they don't spend money stupidly.     16:08:11
13     They don't waste money.  And they spent 200 billion  16:08:16
14     dollars on advertising over the course of Burt       16:08:23
15     Ramsay's life.  200 billion dollars to communicate   16:08:26
16     these different claims and filters and low tar and   16:08:31
17     different brands of their cigarettes.                16:08:36
18          And they did it because it worked; because we   16:08:40
19     see the consumption scale just keep going up during  16:08:45
20     that whole time.  It worked.                         16:08:48
21          MS. CHERRY:  25 minutes.                        16:09:14
22          MR. BERG:  There is a -- I'd like to run a      16:09:14
23     short compilation of some of the ads that you've     16:09:16
24     seen -- or some of the press statements that you've  16:09:21
25     seen in this case.                                   16:09:23

1          (On video.)                                     16:09:35
2                         * * * *                          16:09:35
3          MALE SPEAKER:  (Inaudible) This is a            16:09:35
4     (inaudible) of one of the major producers.           16:09:37
5          I am Dr. Robert DuPuis, chairman of the         16:09:39
6     technical group of the Tobacco Industry Research     16:09:44
7     Committee.  16:09:44
8          (Inaudible) and so far we have not.  We are     16:09:48
9     removing from smoke and still retain the pleasure of 16:09:52
10     your favorite cigarette.                             16:09:56
11          I don't believe that most people who smoke get  16:09:59
12     lung cancer.  We have smoking habits.  This is       16:10:02
13     another incidental (inaudible).  We want             16:10:05
14     (inaudible), just as much as the Surgeon General did 16:10:13
15     and will cooperate in every way.                     16:10:15
16          When you say there is something toxic about     16:10:17
17     tobacco or (inaudible) removal by filter?            16:10:21
18          Well, obviously (inaudible) I don't think       16:10:25
19     (inaudible) admits there are any bad elements.       16:10:32
20     Throughout our entire history the Surgeon General,   16:10:35
21     the A.M.A. (inaudible). And the outcome, it will be  16:10:40
22     removed. 16:10:45
23          We have no program that I know of to try to     16:10:45
24     help people to stop smoking.  We do talk to the      16:10:48
25     question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous. 16:10:54

1     We do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We 16:10:57
2     don't accept that.                                   16:11:01
3          As a manufacturer of the world's                16:11:03
4     biggest-selling cigarette, are you concerned that    16:11:05
5     the World Health Organization said that cigarettes   16:11:09
6     are the cause of a worldwide epidemic because you    16:11:11
7     see at present, kills hundreds and thousands of      16:11:15
8     smokers every day?                                   16:11:17
9          MALE SPEAKER:  Am I concerned?  I'm concerned   16:11:18
10     I've considered the possibility (inaudible).  I'm    16:11:21
11     concerned that people make claims, including those   16:11:24
12     against our products, without adequate knowledge.    16:11:29
13     There has not been the sort of research (inaudible)  16:11:33
14     cigarette to be able to say.                         16:11:36
15          MALE SPEAKER:  It was suspect from the start.   16:11:37
16     ATW Secretary (inaudible) launched his antismoking   16:11:40
17     campaign a year ago with all the zeal of a reformed  16:11:44
18     sinner.  And now in an apparent attempt to bring     16:11:47
19     some science to the side of his new evangelism, the  16:11:50
20     former three-pack-a-day secretary told the Surgeon   16:11:54
21     General, prepare a new report.                       16:11:58
22          (Music) We asked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds,  16:12:00
23     Brown & Williamson and Lorillard to appear on this   16:12:03
24     program.  None would.  They told us to talk to the   16:12:05
25     Tobacco Institute.  The Institute sent Anne Browder  16:12:10

1     to speak for them.                                   16:12:13
2          FEMALE SPEAKER:  The jury has not come in.      16:12:15
3          MALE SPEAKER:  It may not be harmful.  You're   16:12:18
4     not convinced. 16:12:19
5          FEMALE SPEAKER:  It may be or it may not be.    16:12:21
6          MALE SPEAKER:  You're saying that smoking does  16:12:23
7     not cause cancer?  Yes or no?                        16:12:25
8          MALE SPEAKER:  It is not known whether          16:12:27
9     cigarettes cause cancer.  That has not been causally 16:12:28
10     established. 16:12:32
11          MALE SPEAKER:  Cigarette smoking, no causal     16:12:33
12     relationship between cigarette smoking and           16:12:33
13     emphysema?  16:12:33
14          MALE SPEAKER:  Despite all of the research to   16:12:35
15     date there has been no causal link established.      16:12:36
16          MALE SPEAKER:  No causal relationship between   16:12:40
17     cigarette smoking and heart disease?                 16:12:43
18          MALE SPEAKER:  No.  As a matter of fact, there  16:12:44
19     are studies that while we are accused of being       16:12:46
20     associated with heart disease, there have been       16:12:48
21     studies conducted over ten years that would say      16:12:51
22     again that science is still puzzled over these       16:12:54
23     forces. 16:12:57
24          That is (inaudible) arbitrarily placed here by  16:12:58
25     American Tobacco Institute?                          16:13:05

1          MALE SPEAKER:  No, it's not.                    16:13:05
2          MALE SPEAKER:  Would you put that warning       16:13:05
3     (inaudible) 16:13:08

6          MALE SPEAKER:  Certainly do.                    16:13:12
7          MALE SPEAKER:  You don't think the kind of      16:13:13
8     smokers who we believe --                            16:13:18
9          Our product is not injurious to health          16:13:19

11                         * * * *                          16:13:25
12          MR. BERG:  The warnings that were placed at the 16:13:25
13     beginning of the -- the caution in 1966, which was a 16:13:27
14     cautionary warning, Burt Ramsay had already been a   16:13:32
15     smoker for almost ten years at that point.  A        16:13:36
16     regular smoker.                                      16:13:40
17          By the time it went to 1970 and there was a     16:13:41
18     warning that it was dangerous, he switched to -- to  16:13:43
19     low tar.  And he already had been a smoker for well  16:13:46
20     over 12 years at that point, an addicted smoker.     16:13:55
21          Our burden of proof in this case is the greater 16:13:59
22     weight of the evidence.  It's a slight tipping of    16:14:02
23     the scales.  It doesn't mean you can't have any      16:14:05
24     questions.  It doesn't mean you can't have any       16:14:09
25     doubts.  It just means that the evidence that you    16:14:12

1     hear and that you decide, you feel as though it      16:14:16
2     weighs more, it persuades more, it makes more common 16:14:19
3     sense.  And that's the burden of proof in a civil    16:14:24
4     case, which is what we're here on today.             16:14:27
5          I have two last things to say to you and then   16:14:30
6     I'm going to sit down.                               16:14:37
7          The -- Mr. Ramsay, he had -- the evidence in    16:14:39
8     this case is that he had a right to know, he had a   16:14:48
9     right to know about the additives being placed in    16:14:51
10     these cigarettes.  He had a right to know that and   16:14:57
11     make a full, informed choice, that he didn't have    16:14:58
12     that information.  And he would have and should have 16:15:01
13     been able to have that information.                  16:15:06
14          You're going to hear that the -- and you have   16:15:09
15     heard that the tobacco companies acknowledged that   16:15:12
16     the argument about free choice -- and you've seen    16:15:19
17     this document or heard it referred to a couple of    16:15:23
18     different times -- that their own internal documents 16:15:26
19     have indicated that. . .  And this was the Tobacco   16:15:31
20     Institute memo in September of 1980, where there --  16:15:41
21     they indicate the lawyers remind us -- I'm told --   16:15:47
22     that the entire matter of addiction is the most      16:15:50
23     potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a   16:15:53
24     lung cancer cigarette case.  We can't defend         16:15:57
25     continued smoking as, quote, free choice if the      16:16:00

1     person was addicted.                                 16:16:04
2          Lastly, these companies, as evidenced by the    16:16:07
3     document from William Dunn in October of 1977, we    16:16:19
4     mentioned this in opening statement, that these      16:16:26
5     companies looked at the addicted smoker, their own   16:16:30
6     customer, as nothing more than a rat in a cage.  Put 16:16:36
7     a hungry rat in a cage, put a lever in the cage,     16:16:42
8     make it so that it pushes on the lever it delivers a 16:16:45
9     pellet of food, consider the smoker smoking the      16:16:50
10     cigarette as the lever press, the effect of that     16:16:53
11     smoking act upon his person is the reward, that      16:16:56
12     effect reinforces the smoking act.  He comes to push 16:16:59
13     the lever 10 to 60 times per day.                    16:17:04
14          Without the chemical compound nicotine, the     16:17:07
15     cigarette market would collapse; Philip Morris would 16:17:09
16     collapse; and we'd all lose our jobs and our         16:17:13
17     consulting fees.                                     16:17:16
18          I want to thank you, again, for your -- your -- 16:17:23
19     your attention and your sacrifice in this case.      16:17:27
20          If you -- as you go through the jury            16:17:30
21     instructions and you follow those -- those           16:17:33
22     carefully, um, it will lead you to a just decision   16:17:36
23     in this case, and we look forward to that.           16:17:43
24          Thank you.                                      16:17:46
