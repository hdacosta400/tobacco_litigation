12              MS. BAKER:  Thank you, Your Honor, and
13        may it please the Court; counsel.
14              Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
15              JURORS:  Good morning.
16              MS. BAKER:  It's hard to believe that
17        we've been here together for nearly three
18        weeks.  I know it seems a little bit longer to
19        me, and it -- perhaps it does for you, as well.
20              While you got to hear me speak to several
21        witnesses, I have not yet had the opportunity
22        to talk to you directly, like Mr. Kaczynski did
23        both during jury selection and during opening
24        statement.  And so I'm grateful.  I'm grateful
25        for this opportunity to talk to you directly now about some of the issues that you'll be
2        asked to decide on the verdict form.
3              And on behalf of myself and Mr. Kaczynski
4        and Mr. Gordon and our team, who you saw
5        helping us out throughout the trial, I want to
6        thank you.  I want to thank you for your
7        service.
8              While we weren't able to interact with
9        you directly during this trial, we noticed --
10        we noticed how remarkably close attention you
11        were paying to the evidence, the witnesses.
12              I know it wasn't always interesting, and
13        I know some mornings and some afternoons were
14        longer than others, but you paid close
15        attention, you took notes, you asked good
16        follow-up questions, and, most importantly, you
17        took time away from your jobs and your family
18        and your loved ones to serve Broward County as
19        jurors.  And so, for that, we thank you.
20              Now, this is my opportunity --
21              And after I'm done and after you have
22        some lunch, you'll hear Mr. Kaczynski, as well.
23        This is our opportunity to summarize for you
24        the evidence that you've heard over these last
25        two-and-a-half weeks. And I'm going to talk to you about the
2        class membership issues -- you just heard from
3        Mr. McPharlin on that -- I'm going to talk to
4        you about the class membership issues and the
5        medical issues that you may be asked to answer
6        on the verdict form.
7              And I'm going to explain to you why we
8        believe that plaintiff has failed to meet her
9        burden of proving that Mrs. Kaplan was a class
10        member, or that smoking was the cause of her
11        lung cancer, and why -- this is a very
12        important thing, and I'm going to spend some
13        time on it during my portion of the closing
14        argument -- why Ms. Block's COPD claims are
15        barred by the statute of limitations.
16              I'm going to walk through the issues, I'm
17        going to talk to you about the evidence, I'm
18        going to show you the questions on the verdict
19        form that that evidence pertains to.
20              And after I'm finished, as you heard,
21        you'll get a break for lunch, and then
22        Mr. Kaczynski will speak with you about some of
23        the other issues on the verdict form.
24              Now, you may remember that when
25        Mr. Kaczynski spoke to you during opening statement, he told you that plaintiff would
2        spend a lot of time -- and, as it turned out,
3        it was nearly three full days -- they would
4        spend a lot of time talking about statements
5        and ideas from Reynolds and other tobacco
6        companies, most of which were made 30, 40, 50,
7        and sometimes more, 50 or more years ago.
8              But if that was all this case was about,
9        if that is all this case was about, that some
10        cigarette company executive said and did some
11        things that neither you nor I would say or
12        think today, if that was all this was about, we
13        wouldn't be here.  We would not have spent the
14        last two-and-a-half weeks together.  But we
15        did.
16              And we did that because this case isn't
17        about all cigarette smokers.  It isn't about
18        whether we believe people should smoke.  It
19        isn't about whether smoking can cause disease
20        or whether it can be addictive.
21              It can cause disease and it can be
22        addictive.  And maybe you were surprised to
23        hear Mr. Kaczynski say that during opening
24        statement.  It can cause disease and it can be
25        addictive.  But, despite these things, cigarettes are still legal.  They are.
2              They're legal to make, they're legal to
3        sell.  And contrary to what you might have
4        thought after hearing Dr. Cummings, they are
5        legal to advertise.
6              That's not just me saying that.  That's
7        not just me saying that.  Judge Murphy told you
8        that in the instructions that you heard before
9        Mr. McPharlin stood up.
10              This was the instruction that
11        Judge Murphy read to you.  This is Instruction
12        Number 20.  And you'll have these instructions
13        to take back with you to the jury room.
14              The manufacture, advertisement and sale
15        of cigarettes are lawful activities.  The
16        defendants cannot be held liable merely for
17        manufacturing, selling or advertising
18        cigarettes.
19              Now, by now, you know this case is about
20        Lillian Kaplan and only Mrs. Kaplan.  It's not
21        about that class action that you heard so much
22        about, it's not about all smokers, and it's not
23        about tobacco companies in general.  This is
24        not a referendum, this is not a legislative
25        hearing.  This is a court of law. And during the past several weeks, you
2        heard a lot of testimony about things that
3        didn't have much to do with Mrs. Kaplan.  You
4        heard about organizations that Mrs. Kaplan and
5        Ms. Block had never heard of.  You saw
6        documents from companies that aren't here in
7        this courtroom.  And you heard about things
8        that people wrote and said that never reached
9        Mrs. Kaplan's ears.
10              Why did you hear that?  And why did you
11        hear a lot of that again when Mr. McPharlin
12        stood up for his closing argument?
13              You heard that -- make no mistake, you
14        heard that to make you angry, to get you mad,
15        and to distract you from the facts of
16        Mrs. Kaplan's life.
17              You, ladies and gentlemen, you are the
18        only jury that has heard the story of
19        Mrs. Kaplan, and you get to decide the issues
20        in this case.
21              Now, before I get to the verdict form, I
22        want to spend just a moment, because the --
23              You heard from Judge Murphy about the
24        findings, and Mr. McPharlin mentioned those to
25        you during his closing argument. I want to spend just a moment on those
2        findings.  Those findings from an earlier class
3        action that you heard about, there is no
4        debate, none, that those findings don't tell
5        you anything about how to answer any of the
6        specific questions you'll need to answer on the
7        verdict form about Mrs. Kaplan.
8              With your verdict -- with your verdict --
9        you will decide whether you believe that
10        those -- whether you believe that those
11        findings even apply to Mrs. Kaplan and her
12        decisions to smoke and keep smoking.
13              So, with that, let's turn to the first
14        question on the verdict form.  This is the
15        class membership question.
16              And as with nearly every issue in this
17        case, except for statute of limitations --
18        which we'll talk about shortly -- plaintiff
19        bears the burden of proof on this issue.
20              And this question really has two parts.
21        It has two parts.  Part one:  Was Lillian
22        Kaplan addicted to cigarettes containing
23        nicotine?
24              So let's talk about that.
25              Now, having heard the Judge's instructions, you know -- you know that you
2        won't be provided with a definition or a set of
3        medical criteria in those instructions of what
4        it means to be addicted.  There's no specific
5        definition in the instructions, there's not a
6        set of criteria in the Judge's instructions.
7              And you heard from Dr. Kaplan -- and
8        Mr. McPharlin mentioned this in his closing
9        argument -- you heard that there is no
10        consensus definition of "addiction."
11              So what have you heard on this issue?
12        Plaintiff brought you Dr. Cummings.  Plaintiff
13        brought you Dr. Cummings.  And even though the
14        vast majority of his testimony had nothing to
15        do with Mrs. Kaplan, you learned that he uses a
16        very specific term.  He uses the term
17        "assessment," and he uses that for a specific
18        reason.  And that is because he is not trained
19        or licensed to diagnose addiction.  He cannot
20        diagnose addiction.
21              Now, think about that, ladies and
22        gentlemen.  The one expert, the one witness
23        that plaintiff brought to you, to tell you that
24        Mrs. Kaplan was addicted, cannot diagnose
25        addiction. Now, you might have thought otherwise
2        when you heard him testify on direct
3        examination, but he is not a medical doctor.
4        He is not a licensed psychologist.  He is not
5        board certified in anything.  He's not trained
6        or licensed to diagnose addiction, and he
7        cannot do it.  He cannot treat addicted
8        smokers.
9              Now, yesterday you heard Mrs. Kaplan's
10        testimony, and we had to bring you all of
11        Mrs. Kaplan's testimony.  You saw the video
12        last week.  We brought you the rest of
13        Mrs. Kaplan's testimony yesterday.
14              And you heard her testimony that no
15        medical doctor has ever diagnosed her or had
16        ever diagnosed her as being addicted.  And that
17        is still true to this day.  That is still true
18        after Dr. Cummings' testimony.
19              Now, Dr. Cummings reached his conclusion
20        that Mrs. Kaplan was addicted using two
21        simplistic tests:  The Heaviness of Smoking
22        Index and the Fagerstrom test.  Neither of
23        which --
24              Neither of those tests were designed to
25        diagnose addiction, and certainly not in someone like Mrs. Kaplan, who, at the time
2        those tests were administered, had quit 18
3        years prior.
4              And you saw that when Mr. Kaczynski stood
5        up to cross-examine Dr. Cummings on their use,
6        you saw that neither test has a category that
7        says a smoker is not addicted.  So a smoker can
8        literally score zero on those tests and still
9        be found addicted.  A zero and still be found
10        addicted.
11              Now, addiction diagnoses are a big deal.
12        And that's why, when you heard from Dr. Kaplan,
13        they're done by a trained medical professional,
14        by trained healthcare providers.
15              You don't diagnose somebody as addicted
16        based upon simple answers to simple questions
17        like you might find in a BuzzFeed quiz or a
18        Facebook post.  You use validated criteria like
19        the DSM.
20              Now, Dr. Cummings talked about the DSM.
21        He attempted to apply the DSM criteria, but we
22        know he isn't qualified to do that.  We know
23        that because you actually have to be trained to
24        use the criteria, like doctors or nurses or
25        licensed psychologists or social workers. Dr. Cummings is none of these things.  He
2        isn't board certified, he isn't licensed, and
3        he wasn't trained in the use of that criteria.
4              So ask yourselves, is how Dr. Cummings,
5        in his word, is how he assessed Mrs. Kaplan to
6        be addicted, is that how we actually diagnose
7        people in this country with addictions and
8        serious substance use disorders?  Of course
9        not.  Of course it isn't.
10              Now, we brought you Dr. Kaplan.
11        Dr. Kaplan is a board-certified clinical
12        psychiatrist.  He diagnoses and treats patients
13        with addictions.  That's his practice.
14              He can prescribe medication to help
15        people with their addictions, including an
16        addiction to nicotine, and he conducted a
17        two-hour psychiatric examination of
18        Mrs. Kaplan.
19              Unlike Dr. Cummings, he can diagnose
20        addiction.  He is trained, he is board
21        certified, he is a medical doctor.  And he has,
22        unlike what you heard from Mr. McPharlin just a
23        few moments ago, he has diagnosed many smokers
24        as addicted.
25              Unlike Dr. Cummings, he can prescribe medications to help smokers.  And you heard
2        that he does that regularly in his practice.
3        And unlike Dr. Cummings, he has been trained
4        and he has trained other healthcare
5        professionals in how to use the DSM criteria.
6              And, finally, unlike Dr. Cummings, he
7        reviewed all of the medical records in this
8        case, all of the deposition testimony.  And he,
9        as I said, conducted a two-hour psychiatric
10        examination of Mrs. Kaplan, and filled out a
11        very detailed report.  He explained in careful
12        detail how, after all of that, after all of
13        that, he concluded that Mrs. Kaplan was not
14        addicted.
15              So, at the end of the day, you have to
16        ask yourself, is the plaintiff's evidence from
17        Dr. Cummings, who can't diagnose or treat
18        patients -- and he admitted that on the
19        stand -- is that sufficient in a court of law,
20        or should something more be required?
21              Based upon the evidence that you heard,
22        your answer to the question of whether
23        Mrs. Kaplan was addicted should be "no."  It
24        should be "no."
25              Now, even if you believe that plaintiff has met her burden to prove that Mrs. Kaplan
2        was addicted, your work is really just
3        beginning, because that still leaves the second
4        part of the question.
5              Let's go ahead and take a look at that.
6              If Lillian Kaplan was addicted, was her
7        addiction to nicotine a legal cause of her
8        COPD?  Was her addiction, not her smoking, was
9        her addiction to nicotine, was that what caused
10        her COPD?
11              And Mrs. Kaplan's own actions demonstrate
12        that addiction can't be the legal cause of her
13        COPD.  We know that she didn't want to quit
14        smoking before 1994.
15              Now, Mr. McPharlin said this --
16              Well, this question, this part of this
17        question is not about choice, but we know that
18        it is, because when Mrs. Kaplan was motivated,
19        truly motivated in 1994, she quit for good and
20        she never smoked again.
21              Now, you saw legal cause, Judge Murphy
22        instructed you on the legal cause instruction,
23        and Mr. McPharlin talked about that, as well,
24        and let's take a look at that.
25              Addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is a legal cause if it directly and in
2        natural sequence produces or contributes
3        substantially -- substantially -- to producing
4        such COPD, such that, but for an addiction, the
5        COPD would not have occurred.  It must directly
6        and substantially contribute to producing her
7        COPD.
8              Now, Mr. McPharlin talked to you about it
9        didn't have to be the legal cause, it only had
10        to be a legal cause.  But whether it has to be
11        the legal cause or a legal cause, it must be
12        the direct and substantial cause.
13              So this part of the class membership
14        question really boils down to the issue of
15        quitting.  Was Mrs. Kaplan's addiction so
16        strong, so substantial, that it stood in the
17        way of a motivated, committed effort to quit?
18              If you conclude, as I think you should,
19        that Mrs. Kaplan was capable of quitting
20        whenever she was motivated to do so, then
21        addiction is not and cannot be the legal cause
22        of her COPD.  Instead, it is her choice to
23        smoke cigarettes for many years, and her choice
24        not to quit for good until it was too late.
25              Now, Mr. McPharlin is right, "choice" is not a word that you'll see on the verdict form.
2        And it's not in the instructions that the Judge
3        just read you or the legal cause instruction
4        that I just showed you.  But it is a word that
5        is embedded -- it is a concept that is embedded
6        in our common sense.
7              One of the many strengths of the civil
8        jury system is that we put ordinary citizens in
9        the box, and we tell them, use your common
10        sense, apply your common sense.  You don't have
11        to check that common sense at the metal
12        detectors downstairs when you come up here.
13              Judge Murphy just explained to you that
14        you can and you should use your common sense to
15        evaluate the evidence in this case.
16              This is Instruction Number 2:  Your job
17        is to determine what the facts are.  You may
18        use reason and common sense to reach those
19        conclusions.
20              So when we talk about Mrs. Kaplan's
21        choices, use your common sense, apply your
22        reason to this part of the class membership
23        question.  And when we talk about her choices,
24        make no mistake, we're not second-guessing her
25        decisions, we're not second-guessing her choices.  We're asking you to respect her
2        choices.
3              Mrs. Kaplan had the right to make
4        whatever choices she wanted to make in her
5        life, to live her life in the way that she saw
6        fit, to forge her own path.  But with those
7        rights come responsibility.  Those decisions,
8        these choices, and these decisions always stood
9        in between Mrs. Kaplan, in between her claimed
10        addiction and her COPD.
11              Once she started smoking, she was not on
12        a never-ending path to COPD.  There were lots
13        of places along the way where she made
14        decisions and she made choices.
15              She made the choice to become a regular
16        smoker; she made the choice to continue smoking
17        despite warnings from the most credible sources
18        of all, her family.  She made the choice to
19        continue smoking despite other warnings all
20        around her, including on every pack of
21        cigarettes that she bought and smoked from 1966
22        forward.
23              And, ultimately, she made the choice to
24        stop smoking.  Those choices, those decisions,
25        stood in between her claimed addiction and her COPD.
2              Now, the truth is -- and you heard this
3        from virtually ever witness who testified --
4        the truth is, Lillian Kaplan was intelligent
5        and independent, stubborn at times, and for
6        many years she did not listen to the warnings
7        all around her, from TV and newspapers, on
8        every single pack of cigarettes from 1966
9        forward.  And, again, from the most credible
10        sources in her life, her parents, her sister
11        Hilda, her husband and her daughter, Ms. Block.
12              Now, there is no evidence that
13        Mrs. Kaplan tried to quit when her sister Hilda
14        told her to do so.  You remember that story.
15        When Hilda found out that Mrs. Kaplan was
16        smoking, she wanted her to stop, she wanted her
17        to quit, she told her she shouldn't be smoking.
18              And when her sister Hilda was diagnosed
19        with lung cancer, you didn't see any evidence
20        that she tried to quit then, either.  And you
21        didn't see any evidence that she tried to quit
22        when her husband died from COPD.
23              And you heard yesterday, when we brought
24        you Mrs. Kaplan's testimony, you heard that she
25        could have tried harder to quit before 1994, when, as it turned out, it was too late.
2              Now, let me spend just a moment on
3        Ms. Block's testimony.  You heard from
4        Mr. McPharlin about the quit attempts,
5        Ms. Kaplan's efforts to quit smoking, and I
6        want to spend just a moment on Ms. Block's
7        testimony about her mother's attempts to quit.
8              Now, you heard, when I got up to ask
9        Ms. Block questions, that -- before trial,
10        before this trial, under oath, Ms. Block told
11        us that she couldn't quantify, she couldn't
12        tell us how many times her mother had tried to
13        quit smoking.
14              And you know that's an important issue,
15        you know that's a critical issue with respect
16        to this part of the class membership question.
17              But on the stand here, in this courtroom,
18        Ms. Block was sure that it was five or six
19        times.  She was sure, despite her earlier
20        testimony where she told us she couldn't tell
21        us how many times she tried to quit.
22              Now, you heard Judge Murphy's instruction
23        that you have the power to decide whether you
24        find a witness to be believable or whether some
25        of the things they said were influenced in their interest in the outcome of the case.
2              But even if you take Ms. Block's trial
3        testimony, testimony here as true, that
4        Mrs. Kaplan tried to quit five or six times
5        total, you should ask yourself, does trying to
6        quit only five or six times over 50 years --
7        five or six times over 50 years, that's about
8        once a decade -- does that sound like the
9        efforts of someone who was always trying to
10        quit, someone who was a tortured smoker,
11        desperate to quit, someone who would try and do
12        anything to quit?
13              And the answer is, no, it does not sound
14        like someone who was always trying to quit.
15              The fact is, we know that Mrs. Kaplan
16        took none of the standard no-brainer steps that
17        a smoker could take if they were truly
18        motivated and committed to quit.  This is
19        something that Dr. Cummings and Dr. Kaplan
20        actually agreed on.
21              Mrs. Kaplan never used the nicotine
22        patch, she never used the gum, never went to a
23        smoking-cessation clinic.  She never tried
24        hypnosis, she never threw out her ashtrays, her
25        lighters, her matches.  She never changed that behavior.
2              She never asked family members for help.
3        She never asked doctors for help in quitting
4        smoking.  She never asked any of her doctors
5        for a prescription.  And that includes
6        Dr. Doben.  And she never asked her doctors for
7        any stop-smoking guides or any pamphlets on
8        smoking and health, any information on smoking
9        and health.
10              Now, Ms. Block also told us something
11        else.  And, again, this is something that she
12        quibbled with me a little bit about, but I -- I
13        had to show her her prior sworn testimony.
14              She told us that when she talked to
15        Mrs. Kaplan, there were times when she talked
16        to Mrs. Kaplan about her smoking, and
17        Ms. Kaplan would say -- and this is very
18        telling -- this is very telling -- she would
19        say, leave me alone.  Leave me alone.
20              She didn't say, I don't need to quit, or
21        I don't understand that smoking has health
22        risks, or I don't understand that smoking can
23        cause health problems; she said, leave me
24        alone.  Let me be, let me live my life the way
25        I want to live it.  And Ms. Block did just that.
2              Now, Dr. Cummings tried to tell you that
3        nicotine somehow prevents smokers from making
4        the choice to quit, that nicotine addiction
5        means a constrained choice, that nicotine
6        somehow changes the brain in a way that smokers
7        simply can't overcome.
8              But Dr. Cummings candidly -- he candidly
9        acknowledged that he is rooting for the
10        plaintiff to win in this case, that he helps
11        plaintiffs' lawyers in closed seminars, that he
12        has testified in 77 tobacco trials, and that he
13        has earned over $1 million for testifying in
14        these cases.  He told you that half of his
15        annual income since 2011 had come from
16        testifying against tobacco companies.
17              And he told you that he is a general -- a
18        general -- in the war on tobacco, and he has
19        been engaged in that war for many years.  He
20        told you he carries that war right into this
21        courtroom.
22              And you saw what he does in that war.  He
23        shows you snippets of documents, without
24        telling you the whole story, and he applies
25        criteria like the DSM that he is neither trained or licensed to apply.
2              But when he's not in the courtroom, what
3        does he do?  When he's not in the courtroom, he
4        tells smokers that the success rate for
5        quitting is 100 percent.  One hundred percent
6        for people who really want to quit and stick
7        with it.
8              And he publishes things like the brochure
9        "Smart Move."  Mr. Kaczynski showed
10        Dr. Cummings this brochure.  This was
11        Dr. Cummings' brochure.
12              This is what Dr. Cummings tells people
13        about cigarette smoking when he's not in the
14        courtroom.  He says:  Do you have what it takes
15        to stop smoking?  Do you have what it takes to
16        stop smoking?  There is no magic cure that can
17        help you stop.  Take this short quiz to find
18        out if you have what it takes.
19              Number 1:  Do you want to stop smoking?
20        That is the threshold issue:  Do you want to
21        stop smoking?
22              Now, you remember Mr. Kaczynski asking
23        Dr. Cummings about this during
24        cross-examination.  He asked him --
25              He said:  If Mrs. Kaplan said she didn't really want to quit until 1994, she would not
2        have been able to check this box at any point
3        prior to that time.  And Dr. Cummings agreed,
4        as he must.
5              And you heard Dr. Kaplan tell you that
6        when he examined Mrs. Kaplan, when Dr. Kaplan
7        examined Mrs. Kaplan, she told him in that
8        setting that she didn't really want to quit
9        until 1994.
10              Those weren't Mr. Kaczynski's words and
11        those aren't my words, either.  Those were
12        Mrs. Kaplan's words.  Those were her words.
13        She did not want to quit, she wasn't motivated
14        to quit until 1994.
15              Number 2:  Are you willing to make some
16        changes in your daily routine, like throwing
17        out your ashtrays, throwing out your matches,
18        throwing out your lighters, asking your friends
19        and family for help?
20              We know Mrs. Kaplan didn't do that.
21              And are you willing to put up with some
22        uneasy moments after stopping?
23              If you can answer "yes" to all three
24        questions, you can stop smoking.  That's what
25        Dr. Cummings tells people when he's not in the courtroom.  And we know that Mrs. Kaplan
2        couldn't answer "yes" to all three of these
3        questions until 1994.
4              Now, you also heard from Dr. Cummings
5        that 60 million Americans have quit smoking in
6        this country.  He told us that many of those
7        people were addicted, even heavily addicted.
8              All had the temporary brain changes that
9        he discussed during direct examination, but the
10        nicotine in those cigarettes, the nicotine in
11        cigarettes did not prevent these 60 million
12        former smokers from understanding that smoking
13        had health risks and from choosing to quit.
14        And it ultimately didn't prevent Mrs. Kaplan
15        from quitting, either.
16              The evidence shows that Mrs. Kaplan was
17        always in control of her smoking decisions.
18        She made those choices, not the nicotine in
19        cigarettes, and not R.J. Reynolds.  Lillian
20        Kaplan's choices, her decisions, they are the
21        legal cause of her COPD.
22              Your answer to Question 1 on the verdict
23        form should be "no."  Was Lillian Kaplan
24        addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine;
25        and, if so, was such addiction a legal cause? The answer is "no."
2              If you answer this question "no," your
3        verdict is for Reynolds and you have fulfilled
4        your jury service.
5              Now, if you don't --
6              If you don't answer "no" -- we believe
7        you do, but if you don't answer "no," you'll go
8        on to Question 2.
9              Did Mrs. Kaplan know or by the use of
10        reasonable care -- the use of reasonable
11        care -- should she have known before May 5th,
12        1990, that she had COPD, and that there was a
13        reasonable possibility that the COPD was caused
14        by smoking cigarettes?
15              Now, again, we don't think you should get
16        to this question, but I told you earlier that
17        this is an important question, that I was going
18        to spend some time on it.
19              So let me talk about some of the evidence
20        you heard.  You heard a lot of evidence on this
21        issue at trial.  And you might remember that
22        Mr. Kaczynski talked to you about this issue
23        during jury selection.  He specifically talked
24        to you about statute of limitations.
25              This is the law in the State of Florida. It's not a technicality.  This is the law.  And
2        it is one that is fundamentally rooted in
3        fairness.
4              The reason why it is so important to have
5        this defense in the law, why this is the law,
6        and as we see particularly in this case, is
7        that, as time goes by, memories can and do
8        fade.  Medical records are not maintained
9        forever.  Healthcare providers and hospitals
10        only maintain records for a limited period of
11        time.
12              And what the statute of limitations --
13        what that law ensures is that you don't get to
14        put your head in the sand.  You don't get to
15        put your head in the sand and come to court and
16        ask for money and say, Mrs. Kaplan had a
17        hacking cough -- and we'll talk about
18        Ms. Block's testimony on that in a moment --
19        but you don't get to say Ms. Kaplan had a
20        hacking cough, it got progressively worse over
21        time, it was so bad at times that she had
22        trouble catching her breath, and she knew it
23        was caused by her smoking, and she had all of
24        this before May 5th, 1990, while she was still
25        living in New York. And May 5th, 1990, that is the cutoff,
2        that is the statute of limitations in this
3        case.  You don't get to say all of that is
4        true, but there's no record, or she wasn't
5        diagnosed until 1994, so, therefore, you can't
6        prove that she reasonably should have known she
7        had COPD and it was caused by smoking before
8        May 5th, 1990.
9              Now, due to the passage of time, we know
10        in this case that we don't have all the medical
11        records.  We know that.  We have no records
12        from when Mrs. Kaplan lived in New York; and
13        the earliest reference we have in a medical
14        record -- and you heard some about this at
15        trial -- that's from Dr. Doben -- and this is
16        from 1991.  You see that right there.
17              We don't know what Mrs. Kaplan told
18        Dr. Doben about her smoking history.  We don't
19        have any records that show that.  And we don't
20        know what she told him about her medical
21        history before moving to Florida.  But that
22        isn't the end of the story.  That isn't the end
23        of the story.
24              When we look at what we do have before
25        1994, when she was ultimately diagnosed, it, essentially, boils down to a one-page medical
2        record.  That's that medical record from
3        Dr. Doben.  A one-page medical record.  It's a
4        medication list.  It shows what Dr. Doben was
5        prescribing for Mrs. Kaplan.  And you'll have
6        that back in the jury room with you.
7              Now, based on some of the testimony that
8        you heard here in this courtroom, you might
9        have thought that there was a stack of records
10        from Dr. Doben prior to 1994.  There isn't.
11        There is, essentially, a one-page medication
12        list that has some entries that show what
13        Dr. Doben was prescribing for Mrs. Kaplan
14        before 1994.
15              This very little information that we
16        have, however, from Dr. Doben, is telling.  The
17        entries pre-dating Mrs. Kaplan's visit to
18        Dr. Weiner in 1994 demonstrate that she was
19        being prescribed antibiotics for respiratory
20        infections, inhalers to help her breathe, and
21        cough suppressants.
22              Now, when thinking about what was going
23        on during this time period, again, you need to
24        use your common sense, ladies and gentlemen.
25        There's probably no issue in this case that requires you to apply your common sense more
2        than this one.
3              We may not know what Dr. Doben knew when
4        he was treating Mrs. Kaplan in the early 1990s.
5        And you heard that when he testified by
6        deposition, he couldn't precisely remember what
7        was going on during that time period.  He
8        couldn't even really remember when Mrs. Kaplan
9        was diagnosed with COPD.
10              We may not know -- we may not know what
11        Dr. Doben knew, but we certainly know what
12        Mrs. Kaplan knew or should have known at that
13        time.
14              Just one month after the earliest entry
15        on that one-page medication list, just one
16        month, September 1991, Julius Kaplan dies of
17        COPD, after a year's long battle with
18        respiratory problems.
19              Now, because we don't have all of the
20        records, because over time some of those
21        records have been lost, we need to piece the
22        information we do have together.
23              Now, the testimony and evidence put on by
24        plaintiff at trial, and most of what you heard
25        from Mr. McPharlin, focused on the fact that Mrs. Kaplan wasn't diagnosed until 1994, when
2        she went to see Dr. Weiner.  But, again, that
3        is not the end of your inquiry.  The date of
4        diagnosis is not the end of the story here.
5              And you just heard this instruction from
6        the Judge, and we'll take a look at it.  For
7        purposes of this defense, the critical event --
8        the critical event -- is not when her COPD was
9        actually diagnosed by a physician, but when her
10        COPD first manifested itself.  And the
11        instruction goes on.
12              Let's take a look at the next slide,
13        Katie.
14              In making that determination, you may
15        properly consider what Mrs. Kaplan knew prior
16        to May 5th, 1990, concerning the health risks
17        of cigarettes.
18              Now, Mr. McPharlin already mentioned
19        this, and it is true, we bear the burden on
20        this issue.  This is the one issue for which we
21        bear the burden of proof.  So let's walk
22        through the literal mountain of evidence --
23        mountain of evidence -- you heard in this
24        courtroom that Mrs. Kaplan should have known
25        that she had COPD before May 5th, 1990. And in order to do that, I want you to
2        recall Dr. Weiner's testimony.  He came by
3        deposition, too.  Dr. Weiner was Mrs. Kaplan's
4        treating pulmonologist.
5              And when he was asked -- or he described
6        putting all of these pieces that I've talked to
7        you about, putting these pieces together,
8        Mrs. Kaplan's cough and her smoking history, he
9        said it's like putting -- I would have put one
10        plus one equals two.  One, her coughing, her
11        history of a chronic progressive cough, and
12        one, her smoking history, and that should have
13        reasonably led to a diagnosis of COPD.
14              But here, in this case and in this
15        courtroom, there's more than just one plus one.
16        Let's take a look at that.
17              1964, the Surgeon General's report, this
18        is above-the-fold, front-page coverage, in the
19        Sunday Times.  Mrs. Kaplan read that Times.
20        And around this time, Ms. Block is in high
21        school, and she told you that she talked to her
22        parents about the health risks of smoking.  She
23        was talking to her parents about the health
24        risks at this time.
25              1966:  Surgeon General's warning.  You heard from Mrs. Kaplan, herself, yesterday,
2        when we brought you that testimony.  She told
3        you that she remembered that warning and she
4        remembers seeing it on packs.  There's no
5        evidence at this time that Mrs. Kaplan tries to
6        quit smoking.
7              1970, another Surgeon General's warning
8        goes on every pack of cigarettes that
9        Mrs. Kaplan smokes or buys.  And Ms. Block told
10        you that she talked to her parents about this,
11        quote, serious warning.  There's no evidence
12        that Mrs. Kaplan tries to quit at this time.
13              Early 1970s, Mr. Kaplan has a deep,
14        hacking cough.  Hacking, deep from the gut.
15        And sometimes --
16              And you heard this from Arthur Kaplan
17        yesterday -- and, again, that was testimony
18        that we brought to you -- you heard that
19        sometimes Mr. Kaplan would expectorate.  Now,
20        what that means is that sometimes his cough was
21        productive.
22              You heard that the cough was chronic.
23        And, again, you heard from Arthur that
24        Mrs. Kaplan's cough was just like Mr. Kaplan's.
25        It was just like Mr. Kaplan's cough. Now, in describing the cough, you might
2        remember that Ms. Block disagreed with me on
3        this point, when I asked her about it when she
4        was testifying, and I had to show her her prior
5        sworn testimony.  And I want to take a look at
6        that.
7            (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
8        taken down to the best of the reporter's
9        ability as follows:)
10        Q.    Was your mother's cough a hacking cough?
11        A.    No.
12        Q.    All right.  Let's go ahead and take a
13 look at your deposition.
14              MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, can we --
15        Q.    Question:  Okay --
16                  (Video clip paused.)
17              THE COURT:  I'm sorry?
18              MR. McPHARLIN:  Can we approach, please?
19              THE COURT:  Sure.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
4              MS. BAKER:  All right.  Katie, if we can
5        start that again.
6        7     8        follows:)
9        Q.    Was your mother's cough a hacking cough?
10        A.    No.
11        Q.    All right.  Let's go ahead and take a
12 look at your deposition.
13              Question:  Okay.  I know you told us it
14 was when you were a teenager.  Was your mother's cough
15 a hacking cough?
16              Answer:  Yes.
17              That was the answer you provided on this
18 date, correct?
19        A.    Yes.
20        Q.    All right.  And is your testimony now, in
21 this courtroom, that your mother's cough was not a
22 hacking cough?
23        A.    Yes.
24              (Video clip concluded.)
25              MS. BAKER:  All right.  You remember that testimony, ladies and gentlemen.
2              And you have to ask yourself, Ms. Block
3        is the one who is now bringing this lawsuit.
4        She is now the plaintiff in this case.  She is
5        the one who is asking for millions of dollars.
6        When was she telling the truth?
7              Was she telling the truth in a deposition
8        when she was not the plaintiff in this lawsuit,
9        not the one seeking money damages, or was she
10        telling the truth in this courtroom, in 2015?
11              You have to ask yourself why she would so
12        clearly change her testimony on a critical
13        issue now at this trial.
14              Let's go back to our timeline.
15              All right.  This is in the 1970s.
16        Mrs. Kaplan's husband, Julius, starts
17        experiencing lung problems.
18              And among his other health problems --
19        and you heard this from Mrs. Kaplan
20        yesterday -- among his other health problems,
21        he was hospitalized due to these lung problems
22        many times, starting in the 1970s.
23              And you also heard Mrs. Kaplan yesterday.
24        She said that she and her husband linked these
25        lung problems to his smoking.  And he ultimately quit because of those health
2        problems.
3              Now, Ms. Block, when she testified, also
4        told us that Mrs. Kaplan knew -- she knew that
5        smoking was bad for her health.
6              Now, Mr. McPharlin would have you
7        believe, based on his closing argument, that
8        all of these serious warnings, all of these
9        health messages, including those from her
10        family, they were all being drowned out by ads,
11        but Ms. Block told us otherwise.  She told us
12        that Mrs. Kaplan knew smoking was bad for her.
13              Now, let's go back to the timeline.
14        Early 1970s, Peter Block, Mrs. Kaplan's
15        son-in-law at the time, someone she was close
16        to at the time, he quits smoking and he quit
17        smoking because Ms. Block gets on his case and
18        she tells him he needs to quit.
19              And you also heard that Ms. Block would
20        say to her mother -- when she heard her
21        coughing, she would say, what is with your
22        cough?
23              And when she would say things like this,
24        as we've already heard, Mrs. Kaplan would say,
25        leave me alone. Now, you can't have it both ways, ladies
2        and gentlemen.  You can't say that more
3        information about the risks would have
4        influenced your decisions, but then ignore the
5        additional information that you're getting
6        about the risks, and tell people to leave you
7        alone when it's given to you.
8              Now, Mr. Kaplan quits.  We know he quits
9        in the 1980s, we know he quits because he's
10        having health problems.  And at this time --
11        and you heard this from Ms. Block -- at this
12        time, he is literally preaching to Mrs. Kaplan
13        to quit.
14              Late 1980s, he's preaching to Mrs. Kaplan
15        to quit.  Around the same time period -- you
16        heard this during Arthur Kaplan's testimony
17        yesterday -- he would hear his mother coughing
18        and he would hear his mother say, I've got to
19        try to stop smoking.
20              1985, the Surgeon General puts on
21        rotating warnings.  This is on -- these go on
22        every pack of cigarettes.  One of those
23        warnings says:  Smoking causes emphysema.
24        Smoking causes emphysema.
25              In the '80s, Hilda is diagnosed with lung cancer.  She's a smoker, she's diagnosed with
2        lung cancer, and then Hilda's death due to lung
3        cancer, Mrs. Kaplan connects her death to her
4        smoking.
5              And ultimately, as we know, in 1991,
6        Mr. Kaplan dies, and on his death certificate,
7        it says:  COPD.
8              Now, this alone -- this alone,
9        Mr. Kaplan's death in 1991, demonstrates that
10        Mrs. Kaplan knew about COPD long before she
11        goes to see Dr. Weiner in 1994.
12              So when you look at the totality of the
13        evidence, when you put all of these pieces
14        together, you don't just have one plus one,
15        like Dr. Weiner told you, and as he suggested
16        would be enough; you have one plus one plus one
17        plus one, and so on.
18              When you look at the mountain of evidence
19        that Mrs. Kaplan had the classic hallmark
20        symptoms of COPD prior to May 5th, 1990, that
21        she believed were caused by smoking, a cough
22        like her husband, a cough like her husband who
23        had lung problems, put him in the hospital, and
24        whose death certificate said COPD, a cough that
25        was hacking, progressive and chronic, when you put all of these pieces together, her symptoms,
2        what she knew and when she knew it in New York,
3        long before she ever moved to Florida, and when
4        you add to this the most personal and serious
5        of all warnings, symptoms like those
6        experienced by your spouse who was also a
7        smoker, who was sick for years, who was sick
8        for years with and hospitalized for respiratory
9        problems, and someone who eventually died of
10        COPD, when you put all of these pieces together
11        and apply your common sense, it is clear that
12        Mrs. Kaplan should have known, through the use
13        of reasonable care, prior to May 5th, 1990,
14        that she had COPD and there was a reasonable
15        possibility it was caused by smoking.
16              On this second question on the verdict
17        form, you should check "yes."  You should check
18        "yes."  And if you do, again, your verdict is
19        for Reynolds and you have fulfilled your jury
20        service.
21              Now, I told you at the beginning that my
22        job was to talk to you about the class
23        membership issues and statute of limitations.
24              THE COURT:  Ten minutes, Counsel.
25              MS. BAKER:  Thank you, Your Honor. But I'm also going to talk to you just
2        very briefly about two other medical issues.
3              Now, if you move on, if you don't
4        answer -- if you don't answer "yes" to statute
5        of limitations, you move on down the verdict
6        form, so let me spend just a moment on
7        Mrs. Kaplan's lung cancer.
8              And you have to go all the way down the
9        verdict form to Question 6.
10              Was smoking cigarettes manufactured by
11        Reynolds a legal cause of Mrs. Kaplan's lung
12        cancer?
13              This is really a two-part question again.
14        The first question:  Did lung cancer cause --
15              Let me read that again.
16              Was smoking cigarettes manufactured by
17        Reynolds a legal cause of Lillian Kaplan's lung
18        cancer?
19              Again, this is a two-part question.  Did
20        lung cancer cause her death?  There's no
21        dispute about that.  No question that
22        Mrs. Kaplan died of lung cancer.  We haven't
23        disputed that throughout this trial.
24              The second part asks if smoking caused
25        Mrs. Kaplan's lung cancer.  And the answer to that must be "no," because the plaintiff did
2        not meet her burden.
3              Now, let me talk about what Dr. Villa and
4        Dr. Keller -- what the experts on these issues
5        had to say.  You heard over and over that
6        Mrs. Kaplan had not smoked a single cigarette
7        in 18 years at the time she was diagnosed with
8        lung cancer in 2012.  She also had
9        adenocarcinoma, and you heard Dr. Villa say
10        that is the most common type of cancer among
11        female nonsmokers.
12              Both Dr. Villa and Dr. Keller agreed that
13        the risk of lung cancer, the risk of disease
14        caused by smoking, declines when someone quits
15        smoking.  And Dr. Villa said the risk has
16        plummeted 70 to 80 percent, 18 years after a
17        smoker like Mrs. Kaplan quits.
18              Both Dr. Villa and Dr. Keller agreed that
19        age can be a risk factor for all kinds of
20        cancer, including lung cancer.  And that means,
21        the longer you live, the more likely you are to
22        get lung cancer.
23              And, as we know, and as we've discussed
24        many times, Mrs. Kaplan was 83 when she was
25        diagnosed.  And both doctors -- both agreed that age was a risk factor for her.
2              And you also heard something very
3        important from Dr. Villa.  You heard from
4        Dr. Villa that genetics play a critical role in
5        determining one's risk for lung cancer.
6              And here is what we know about
7        Mrs. Kaplan's family history of cancer:  In
8        just her immediate family, alone, her father
9        died of multiple myeloma.  That's a blood
10        cancer.  Her sister, Pearl, died of bladder
11        cancer.  And Hilda, as we know, died of lung
12        cancer.  At the time of her diagnosis,
13        Mrs. Kaplan had outlived all of her siblings by
14        decades.
15              Plaintiffs simply cannot show that at age
16        83, 18 years after she quit smoking, that
17        smoking was a substantial contributing factor
18        to Mrs. Kaplan's lung cancer.  Plaintiff cannot
19        meet her burden on this issue.
20              So if you get this far on the verdict
21        form, you should check "no."  You should check
22        "no" to this question.
23              Now, let me spend just a moment on
24        stroke.  You didn't hear Mr. McPharlin talk
25        about Mrs. Kaplan's stroke at all, so let me -- let me very briefly address this issue so that
2        I can say that I've covered all the medical
3        issues that you heard about at this trial.
4              And this will be the last issue that I
5        address before I turn the reins -- before your
6        lunch break, and certainly before I turn the
7        reins over to Mr. Kaczynski to cover the
8        remaining issues.
9              Now, you heard a good bit about
10        Mrs. Kaplan's stroke in February of 2012.  And,
11        again, she was 83 years old when she had that
12        stroke.
13              You also heard that, prior to her stroke,
14        her COPD was stable.  She was living
15        independently, she was taking care of her own
16        home, she was driving, she was running her own
17        errands, and she was taking out-of-state trips
18        to Arizona to visit family and with a friend to
19        Las Vegas.
20              Shortly after her stroke, she was
21        diagnosed with lung cancer.  We know that.  And
22        she died in September of that same year.
23              Now, if you find that Mrs. Kaplan's lung
24        cancer was caused by smoking, you will not
25        consider her stroke, if you determine that plaintiff is entitled to damages --
2              MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, that's improper.
3        That's not the law.
4              THE COURT:  Sustained.  Rephrase,
5        Counsel.
6              MS. BAKER:  To the extent you get this
7        far on the verdict form, let me explain to
8        you -- let me talk some to you about why her
9        stroke -- why plaintiff did not show that
10        Mrs. Kaplan's stroke was caused by smoking or
11        her lung cancer.
12              Now, we brought you Dr. Bishopric.  You
13        heard from Dr. Bishopric last Friday by video.
14        She's a specialist in cardiovascular diseases.
15        She is a cardiologist.  She has treated
16        thousands of stroke patients at the University
17        of Miami; and before she came to the University
18        of Miami, out in California.  She is a
19        distinguished researcher, teacher and clinician
20        at the University of Miami.
21              And, at the outset, both Dr. Bishopric
22        and Dr. Villa agree that, once you quit
23        smoking, once a smoker quits, within only a few
24        years after they quit, their risk for getting a
25        stroke due to smoking has returned to that of a never-smoker.  That means your risk is no
2        greater than someone who never smoked a day in
3        their life.
4              According to Dr. Villa, by 1996 or 1997,
5        Mrs. Kaplan's risk for stroke due to smoking
6        had returned to that of a never-smoker.  That's
7        what Dr. Villa told you.
8              Now, Dr. Bishopric also told us that,
9        after Mrs. Kaplan quits smoking, she developed
10        other significant health conditions, including
11        hypertension, high blood pressure,
12        hyperlipidemia -- that's high cholesterol and
13        high triglycerides -- and diabetes.  These
14        conditions weren't related to her smoking, but
15        they were significant and they were significant
16        independent risk factors for Mrs. Kaplan's
17        stroke.  Dr. Villa agreed with that.
18              In fact, Dr. Bishopric showed you the
19        medical records which said that at the time of
20        Mrs. Kaplan's stroke in February of 2012,
21        Mrs. Kaplan's hypertension and her diabetes
22        were uncontrolled.  They were uncontrolled at
23        that time.  Dr. Villa agreed with that, too.
24              But Dr. Villa said that Mrs. Kaplan's
25        lung cancer might have also contributed to her stroke.  It might have made her blood more
2        likely to clot.  But Dr. Bishopric explained
3        that the kinds of clots that are caused by
4        malignancies or cancer like Mrs. Kaplan had,
5        they happen on the venous side of the
6        circulatory system, not the arterial side.
7              You remember her description of those two
8        sides of the circulatory system?  Mrs. Kaplan's
9        stroke happened on the arterial side, not the
10        venous side, where strokes or clots due to lung
11        cancer or malignancies can occur.
12              And just as importantly, there was a
13        question from one of you.  After Dr. Villa
14        testified, there was a question from one of
15        you, asking Dr. Villa if he could quantify the
16        contribution of Mrs. Kaplan's lung cancer to
17        her stroke.  And he told you he couldn't do
18        that.  He could not do that.
19              You didn't hear it during direct
20        examination, but when you put that question to
21        him, he told you he could not say that the lung
22        cancer was a substantial contributing cause of
23        her stroke.
24              So if you get to this point -- and
25        Mr. Kaczynski is going to talk to you more about these issues when he stands up to
2        speak -- but if you get to this point and you
3        decide that Ms. Block is entitled to money, you
4        should not base that award on Ms. Kaplan's
5        stroke.
6              Now, I have reached the end of my time
7        and it's just a few moments before your --
8        before your lunch break, and I appreciate your
9        patience throughout my time up here and
10        throughout this trial.
11              I have explained these issues in the best
12        way that I know how.  That Mrs. Kaplan was not
13        a class member, that Ms. Block's claim is
14        barred by the statute of limitations, and that
15        plaintiff has not met her burden to show that
16        Mrs. Kaplan's lung cancer or stroke was caused
17        by smoking.
18              I ask that you apply your common sense to
19        the evidence that you heard in this courtroom,
20        I ask that you focus on that evidence and the
21        law as Judge Murphy has instructed you, and
22        return a verdict in favor of Reynolds.
23              It's been an honor and a privilege to
24        present this case to you, and I thank you for
25        your time. Thank you, Your Honor.


19       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.
20 Ms. Block, counsel.
21       Good afternoon.
22       JURORS:  Good afternoon.
23       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Seems like an eternity
24 since we spoke in jury selection, but slowly
25 and surely, we're getting there. I think in jury selection I told you
2 folks that I didn't think people ever got tired
3 of being thanked.  So this is the third time
4 today you're being thanked, maybe the fourth.
5 And we do thank you for your service.
6       Everything that everyone said before goes
7 for me, too.  We know you had a lot of
8 sacrifices, took a hunk out of your lives.
9       We all make great sacrifices to make this
10 great country of ours work.  And you answered
11 the call of Broward County, and I thank you for
12 it.
13       As I said many times, the system couldn't
14 work without you.  It's true by showing up for
15 jury duty every day, you've helped our judicial
16 system work, and we appreciate it.
17       I'm going to talk to you about that part
18 of the verdict form that we don't think you
19 should reach.
20       But if you get to the point where you
21 find that Mrs. Kaplan was an Engle class
22 member, then the first thing I'm going to talk
23 to you about is the concept called "comparative
24 responsibility."
25       That's the part of the verdict form where you have to decide by percentages who was
2 responsible for Mrs. Kaplan's choices,
3 Mrs. Kaplan or somebody else.
4       And as I think you heard from Ms. Baker
5 already, we are not asking you to blame
6 Mrs. Kaplan for her choices.  We're asking
7 you -- we're not asking you to put her at
8 fault.  We're, rather, asking you to respect
9 her choices.
10       And we've been up front with you from the
11 beginning in jury selection, I don't know if
12 you recall.  But our position is, has been and
13 is today, that it's Mrs. Kaplan and only
14 Mrs. Kaplan who was responsible for her choices
15 regarding her smoking decisions.
16       It was only Mrs. Kaplan that could have
17 chosen to begun to smoke.  It was only
18 Mrs. Kaplan that has chosen to continue to
19 smoke, and it was only Mrs. Kaplan who could
20 make the choice whether to quit or not.
21       And if she made that choice, to seriously
22 follow through on it.
23       Now, when she was on the stand, Ms. Block
24 made her position perfectly clear too.  She
25 told you she didn't think her mother bore any responsibilities for her choices, none, zero.
2       It's all somebody else's fault.  Somebody
3 else's fault she started.  Somebody else's
4 fault she continued, somebody else's fault she
5 could not quit until 1994.
6       We got personal choice, we got personal
7 responsibility.  It's all somebody else's
8 fault.
9       Now, this morning you heard them budge a
10 little bit on that position.  Well, maybe
11 5 percent.  Maybe it's 5 percent Mrs. Kaplan's
12 responsibility.
13       Well, we're going to walk through in a
14 bit all the information that was available to
15 Mrs. Kaplan when she made her choices: The
16 newspapers, the magazines, the TV, the warning
17 labels, the public service announcements.
18       And it was in the face of all this that
19 Mrs. Kaplan decided to smoke and to continue to
20 smoke until 1994.
21       And she told Dr. Kaplan she really didn't
22 want to quit before 1994.  Is that somebody
23 else's fault?
24       She told Dr. Kaplan she really thinks she
25 could have tried harder to quit before 1994. Was that somebody else's fault?
2       She chose not to quit in an era when
3 60 million Americans chose to quit.  Was that
4 somebody else's fault?
5       And many of those 60 million who chose to
6 quit during this period were addicted.  Was
7 prior to 1994 Mrs. Kaplan somehow different
8 than those 60 million people?
9       And we know from the testimony we heard
10 that things would have been difficult for her
11 had they made a different decision, a decision
12 to quit.
13       Dr. Villa told us that if Mrs. Kaplan
14 quit smoking as late as 1982, her risk of lung
15 cancer would have gone down 90 to 95 percent.
16       Again, whose fault is it that Mrs. Kaplan
17 decided otherwise?
18       Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Kaplan and
19 nobody else made those choices.  Not 5 percent,
20 not 10 percent, not 50 percent.  But it was
21 100 percent her choice.
22       And Mrs. Kaplan and nobody else -- nobody
23 else -- is responsible for those choices.  It
24 is not somebody else's fault.
25       So very simply, we're asking you to respect her choices when you get the verdict
2 form.  And when you get this line on the
3 verdict form, we're asking you to fill in
4 100 percent on the line for Mrs. Kaplan.
5       Now, the next subject you're going to
6 have to address is the subject of reasonable
7 reliance.  The part that deals with whether
8 Mrs. Kaplan reasonably relied on anything
9 Reynolds said or did.
10       And these are the very specific questions
11 that you're going to be asked to answer.  And
12 they are small print, so out come the glasses:
13       Did Lillian Kaplan reasonably rely to her
14 detriment on any statement of material fact
15 made by the defendant that concealed or
16 omitted -- here are the keywords -- material
17 information not otherwise known or available to
18 her concerning the health effects and/or
19 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes; and if
20 so, was such reliance a legal cause of any of
21 Lillian Kaplan's injuries and/or death?
22       Question number 5:  Did Lillian Kaplan
23 reasonably rely to her detriment on any
24 statements and/or acts made in furtherance of
25 defendant's agreement to conceal or omit material information not otherwise known or
2 available to her concerning the health effects
3 and/or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes;
4 and if so, was such reliance a legal cause of
5 Lillian Kaplan's injuries and/or death?
6       I'm going to admit to you that in that
7 video deposition you saw, the one that was
8 taken after her stroke, the one that was taken
9 a month before Mrs. Kaplan passed away, the one
10 in which she was answering suggestive questions
11 from her lawyer --
12       MR. McPHARLIN:  Objection, Judge,
13 improper.
14       THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you are
15 to rely on your own recollection of the
16 evidence.  This is argument.
17       Proceed, Counsel.
18       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.
19       Mrs. Kaplan, in that deposition, said she
20 did rely on some unspecified statement from
21 somebody that said smoking was safe.
22       We don't know who, we don't know when, we
23 don't know what was said.
24       But if you look back at the three volumes
25 of deposition testimony that they didn't show you, they didn't show you to this day.  We had
2 to do that.
3       We showed you those three volumes of
4 depositions, testimony taken four years before
5 her stroke, testimony taken when her memory was
6 unimpaired.
7       And what do we find there?  Well, for
8 starters, we find out that they wasted your
9 time showing you all those statements from the
10 Tobacco Institute and CTR, all those videos, a
11 complete waste of your time.  Why?
12       Because in her three-volume deposition
13 that you weren't shown by plaintiff four years
14 before the stroke, Mrs. Kaplan told us she
15 never heard of CTR, she never heard of the
16 Tobacco Institute, she never heard any
17 statements made by CTR, and she never heard any
18 statements made by the Tobacco Institute.
19       And you know, truth be told, nobody has,
20 really.
21       I think it's fair to say that the things
22 that TI or CTR said or did got a whole lot more
23 air time in courtrooms like this than they ever
24 did in real life.
25       In Dr. Cummings' world, these organizations were Goliaths.
2       In the real world, the real world of
3 people like Mrs. Kaplan, these organizations
4 were invisible, and she never heard of them.
5 And, quite frankly, very few people probably
6 did.
7       So let's say, did she rely on anything
8 Reynolds said or did to start smoke something.
9       Now, once again, plaintiff never told you
10 why she started to smoke up to and including
11 today.  We had to do that.
12       I did it when cross-examining
13 Dr. Cummings.  And you heard it in the
14 deposition testimony of those three volumes of
15 Mrs. Kaplan's testimony that plaintiffs didn't
16 show you.
17       She was baby-sitting, she was offered a
18 cigarette, and she took it.  She didn't feel
19 pressured to take it.  She didn't feel curious
20 about smoking when she took it, and she didn't
21 become a regular smoker until -- well, when she
22 became a regular smoker she did not yet start
23 to see cigarette advertisements, not yet.
24       Let's compare and contrast a few things
25 about the deposition she took, she gave us before her stroke and after her stroke.
2       Compare and contrast.  Let's take a look.
3       Before her stroke, when her memory was
4 good, she said:  Was there anything about the
5 ads for Kent with filters you can recall?
6       No.
7       It's fair to say that you can't recall
8 seeing a particular Kent advertisement, right?
9       After her stroke when her memory is
10 impaired:  I'm going to show you some ads for
11 Kent, right?
12       Are these advertisements that you saw
13 when you were smoking?
14       Yeah, when I was smoking.
15       In her deposition before her stroke, she
16 told us:  Carltons, do you recall any specific
17 advertisements for Carltons?
18       No.
19       After her stroke, she starts describing a
20 Carlton ad.
21       In a deposition before her stroke, she
22 said -- she didn't believe every word she read
23 in ads.  She didn't believe one is better than
24 the other.
25       After her stroke, she says:  Did you ever hear the tobacco company say smoking was safe?
2       Always.
3       Did you believe them when they said that?
4       Yes.
5       In her deposition before the stroke, most
6 importantly she said:  Did you ever see an
7 advertisement for cigarettes that said any
8 brand of cigarettes was safe to smoke?
9       ANSWER:  I didn't see anything that said
10 safe or unsafe.
11       In her deposition after her stroke,
12 Mrs. Kaplan told us that her memory was
13 impaired.
14       Yet miraculously, sometime in the time of
15 the deposition, after her stroke, she managed
16 to remember ads that she could not remember
17 four years earlier before her stroke.
18       I mean, it's pretty clear what went on
19 here.  Maybe --
20       MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, that's improper,
21 move to strike.
22       THE COURT:  Jurors, disregard the last
23 comment.
24       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Somehow she managed to
25 improve her memory after the stroke as regards to issues in this lawsuit.
2       Now, whether or not Mrs. Kaplan relied on
3 anything Reynolds said or did is a question of
4 fact for you.
5       We've been telling you from the start,
6 you're the judges of the facts.
7       You know there are true facts and there
8 are litigation-generated facts.  And what you
9 heard in that video, that video deposition --
10 first of all, was sad.  I think we'd all agree
11 to that.
12       But what you heard from this 84-year-old
13 ailing woman who could not remember her son's
14 name, but somehow could remember ads from 60
15 years ago under suggestive questioning from her
16 lawyer?  These are litigation-generated facts.
17       Because if you go back to her 2008
18 deposition before her stroke, before her memory
19 was impaired, she gave lengthy and detailed
20 depositions that the plaintiff chose not to
21 show you.
22       You have the true facts from those
23 depositions.  The true facts, not the
24 litigation facts.
25       Or that she never heard of TI or CTR. She never relied on anything Reynolds said or
2 did in advertising or otherwise.
3       And even if you were to give credence to
4 that stroke-impaired deposition and somehow
5 believe her, took her at her word that there
6 was reliance, the reliance still has to be
7 reasonable.  It's got to be reasonable.
8       And the concealed material has got to be,
9 as that instruction said, material information
10 not otherwise known or available to her.
11       And this is where plaintiff has a
12 problem.  On the one hand, they want you to
13 believe that Mrs. Kaplan was unaware of the
14 risks of smoking.
15       On the other hand, they want you to
16 believe that she was looking for reassurance in
17 advertising and that she was constantly trying
18 to quit.
19       Well, you can't have it both ways.  Why
20 would somebody be seeking reassurance if she
21 didn't think there was some danger to be
22 reassured about?
23       Why would somebody be constantly trying
24 to quit, unless they knew that smoking was
25 harmful to them in some way? You heard this morning the definition of
2 "addiction" being persistent use, despite
3 knowledge that it's harmful.
4       And you heard this morning that that fits
5 Lillian Kaplan to a T.  Well, you can't have it
6 both ways.  Either she acknowledges it's
7 harmful, she knows it's harmful, or she
8 doesn't.
9       Ladies and gentlemen, the facts of this
10 case show that Lillian Kaplan was surrounded by
11 information about the dangers of smoking all
12 her life.
13       She subscribed to Reader's Digest.  You
14 saw some of those articles, including this one,
15 Beware That Cigarette Cough.
16       And it tells you if you have a cigarette
17 cough, a hacking cough -- where did you hear
18 that word before?  A hacking cough -- get to a
19 doctor for a complete respiratory examination,
20 including chest X-rays and lung function
21 diagnosis.  Now, before it's too late.
22       Because smoker's cough may herald
23 advancing emphysema, COPD, and the end can be
24 strangulation, drowning in trapped mucous.
25       This was material known and available to her.  These articles are in evidence.  You can
2 read them.
3       She subscribed to Life Magazine.  And
4 you've seen this article, this graphic story
5 and others.  This was material known or
6 available to her, this and others are in
7 evidence.  You can read them.
8       She grew up in the media capital of the
9 world, and she took advantage of the media
10 outlets.  She read the New York Post.  And you
11 saw some of the articles.  This is material
12 known and available to her, there in evidence.
13 You can read them.
14       Now, Ms. Block suggested Mrs. Kaplan only
15 read page 6 of the post.  Page 6 is the gossip
16 page.
17       But in the next breath, she said that
18 Mrs. Kaplan kept up on current events and read
19 the general news stories.  You don't find
20 either of that on page 6.
21       She read the New York Times.  You've seen
22 some of these articles.  This was material
23 known and available to her.  These are in
24 evidence.  You can read them.
25       And especially this one, 1964 Surgeon General's Report.  Sunday Times.  Exactly what
2 she said.  Front page, above the fold.
3       Known and available to her.
4       Here in Florida, she read the
5 Sun-Sentinel.  You heard she watched
6 60 Minutes.
7       Well, the 60 Minutes of the 1950s was a
8 show, as you heard, called "See It Now," and it
9 was beamed into houses all across the United
10 States.  And it beamed in there a two-part
11 series on smoking and health.
12       And the bottom-line message of that
13 program was provided by Dr. Hammond, the famous
14 cancer researcher, in 1955.
15       Let's see what he said.
16 17    18       follows:)
19       VOICE:  It is now established in my
20 opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that
21 cigarette smoking greatly increases the
22 probability of developing lung cancer.
23       In my opinion, people should be warned of
24 the dangers, and they are being warned.
25       What they then want to do, whether they wish to smoke or not, is their own business.
2       (Video clip concluded.)
3       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Now, the fact that people
4 were being warned in the 1950s didn't just come
5 from Dr. Hammond.  We heard that it came from
6 these folks, the Surgeon General of the United
7 States and the director of the National Cancer
8 Institute.  Excellent coverage informing the
9 public.
10       Bear in mind, these are people from the
11 1950s, in the 1950s, interested in the public
12 health of the 1950s.
13       These aren't people in the year 2015,
14 looking backwards in hindsight and reinventing
15 history -- rewriting history.
16       This is what happened on the ground at
17 the time.  People were being warned.
18       And you heard it on the night of
19 January 11, 1964, all three networks had
20 special news reports on the release of the
21 Surgeon General's Report.  You couldn't avoid
22 the story.
23       Here, too, the bottom line was:  You have
24 the information.  The choice is yours.  Harry
25 Reasoner. (The video clip was played and taken down
2    3       follows:)
4       VOICE:  In this kind of a country, it
5 comes down to you, whether you like it or not.
6 No one is going to forbid an adult to smoke.
7       And it is now quite clear that no one is
8 going to tell him it's good for him either.
9       The decision is his, the decision and the
10 health that may depend on it.
11       This is Harry Reasoner.  Good night.
12       (Video clip concluded.)
13       MR. KACZYNSKI:  This was material known
14 and available to her.
15       There were warning labels.  This was
16 material known and available to her.
17       There are public service announcements.
18 These are four that were played for you during
19 the course of this trial.  This was material
20 known and available to her.
21       And we all know she also got the message
22 in a very personal way.  She saw her sister, a
23 smoker, die of lung cancer.  She saw her
24 husband, a smoker, repeatedly hospitalized with
25 lung problems. Then she saw her son smoking and warned
2 him:  If you keep smoking, you're going to wind
3 up getting a cough like I have.
4       Everybody says Mrs. Kaplan was an
5 intelligent woman.  To suggest this intelligent
6 woman ignored all this information that was
7 known and available to her, to suggest that she
8 ignored it and instead relied on Lucy and Desi
9 or Johnny Roventini or Fred Flintstone for her
10 health information, that defies belief.
11       But in any event, even if she did, it
12 would not be reasonable reliance.
13       So when you get to this line on the
14 verdict form, these two lines, we're asking you
15 to check "no."
16       And there's one other instruction you're
17 going to hear that's relevant to this that I
18 want to call to your attention.  It's this.
19 If, despite our argument that Mrs. Kaplan
20 should bear full responsibility for her
21 actions, you think that responsibility ought to
22 be apportioned, then you've got to check "no"
23 to these two questions.
24       Why?  Because Judge Murphy will instruct
25 you -- already has instructed you -- that if you check "yes," there will be no apportionment
2 of damages between Mrs. Kaplan and Reynolds.
3       MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, that's not the
4 law.  Object to that improper reference of the
5 law.
6       THE COURT:  Thank you.
7       Ladies and gentlemen, you have the
8 instructions, the instruction I gave you.  This
9 is counsel's take on those instructions.
10       Proceed, Counsel.
11       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Thank you.
12       This is the instruction:  Please note
13 that if you find for plaintiff on either or
14 both of her claims for fraudulent concealment
15 and/or agreement to conceal, the Court will not
16 reduce the amount of plaintiff's damages by the
17 percentage of fault you assign to Mrs. Kaplan.
18       What that means is, if you check "yes" on
19 either of those claims, Ms. Block will have
20 gotten her wish, and Ms. Kaplan will be held
21 zero percent responsible.
22       Obviously you render your verdict based
23 on the evidence and the instructions you have.
24 But we wanted to let you know about these two
25 questions.  And still, this is how we can do it for now.
2       Now, if we march down the form and we get
3 to the point where you think money damages are
4 appropriate, then you have to come up with an
5 amount.  There will be any number of lines on
6 the verdict form for you to do that.
7       Apart from Mr. McPharlin's request for
8 millions, 4 million or 8 million, for the
9 passing of this 84-year-old woman, you don't
10 have a lot of guidance on how to come up with a
11 number.  It's tough.
12       But consider these factors.  Mrs. Kaplan
13 lived a full and successful life.  She was
14 married for 40 years.  She ran and operated a
15 business with her husband.  She raised two
16 children.  She was fortunate to escape the
17 New York winters and come down here to Florida.
18 And in passing away at the age of 84, she had
19 outlived all her siblings by decades.
20       Think about it.  Mrs. Kaplan was born
21 during the presidency of Calvin Coolidge and
22 passed away during the presidency of Barack
23 Obama.  That's a long, long time.
24       As an amount, nobody can hand you a
25 yardstick.  Let me offer you a few suggestions. You heard Mrs. Block testify from that
2 witness stand that during her mother's life,
3 she was carrying out her mother's wishes.  And
4 you heard that her mother actually filed this
5 lawsuit to start it off.
6       And when she did that, she told us under
7 oath, Mrs. Kaplan did, what damages she wanted.
8 Here it is --
9       MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, can we approach
10 for a second?
11       THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
12       (The following discussion was held at
13       sidebar:)
14       MR. McPHARLIN:  This is exactly what they
15 told you they weren't going to do when we
16 argued about whether this interrogatory could
17 be read.
18       Ms. Baker told you -- I said, Judge,
19 they're going to get up and argue that because
20 the interrogatory reads this way, they aren't
21 looking for any damages other than medical.
22       Ms. Baker said, You know what, Judge,
23 we're not going to do that.
24       That's about exactly what they're about
25 to do. MR. KACZYNSKI:  Your Honor, what was
2 represented was plaintiff was not seeking that.
3 Clearly, they are seeking it.  I'm entitled to
4 suggest a measure of damages.  He already did.
5 This is the measure of damages I'm suggesting.
6       MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, it is completely
7 inconsistent and disingenuous for them to tell
8 you they're not going to argue that we are not
9 seeking damages for that.
10       And now to use it and say they weren't
11 seeking damages to that, that's how they got it
12 in.  That's how they argued it to you.
13       THE COURT:  That's not how they got it
14 in, Counsel.  There was an interrogatory that
15 was asked, sworn to and --
16       MR. McPHARLIN:  But that's not what they
17 told you.
18       THE COURT:  I specifically asked what
19 they're going to use and how they're going to
20 use it.
21       My understanding was not to say that
22 there was damages, but there's a purpose to --
23 there is a purpose for interrogatories,
24 Counsel.  In the answer -- if you didn't like
25 the answer given, you could come back in and changed it.  That was the answer given.
2       Overruled.  Let's go.
3       (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
4       following was held in open court:)
5       MR. KACZYNSKI:  So during her lifetime,
6 Mrs. Block testified she was carrying out her
7 mother's wishes.
8       And her mother -- put it up, Katie.
9       This was her mother's wish for damages in
10 her lawsuit.  Medical expenses.  Medical
11 expenses.
12       Now, you heard that number, and I'm going
13 to guess it's in your notes, hundreds of
14 thousands.  Mrs. Kaplan's wishes were a few
15 hundred thousand dollars.
16       Ms. Block's wishes are, as Mr. McPharlin
17 told you, 4 million or 8 million.
18       We're going to ask you to honor
19 Mrs. Kaplan's wishes if you decide to award
20 damages and award her what she asked for.
21       Now, if you decide that's not sufficient,
22 then I'm going to ask you to think of this.
23 Mrs. Kaplan's COPD was not debilitating.
24       You heard a description by the lawyer
25 this morning about her lifestyle.  But don't take lawyer's word for it.  Let's take the
2 doctor's word for it.
3       What did her doctors say?  Patient was
4 ambulating independently and performing all
5 activities of daily living independently
6 without any assistive devices.  This is up to
7 her stroke.
8       So problems began with her stroke in
9 2012, February 2012, and ended with her passing
10 in September of that same year.
11       You know, it's hard to put a value on a
12 human life.  Unfortunately, if you get to
13 damages, you're going to have to do that.
14       If you're looking for a yardstick, I
15 would suggest that you think of this lawsuit
16 much like you think of a life insurance policy.
17       And if you do, the numbers come out in
18 the same range.  The numbers come out in the
19 range of hundreds of thousands, not the
20 windfall millions plaintiff is asking for.
21       Now, if we've been unsuccessful in
22 persuading you up to this point, you will have
23 to decide whether punitive damages are
24 appropriate.
25       And if you find that they are, as Mr. McPharlin said, we'll all come back, we'll
2 have another session, both sides will put on
3 evidence, both sides will argue again, and you
4 will arrive at a figure.
5       But bear in mind, if you get to -- once
6 you get to that box on punitive damages, if you
7 have awarded money, you will by then have fully
8 compensated Ms. Block for her loss.
9       Punitive damages are designed to punish
10 past misconduct or to deter future misconduct.
11 And the plaintiff must proven entitlement to
12 punitive damages by clear and convincing
13 evidence, and you have in your instructions the
14 definition of that.
15       First of all, let's be clear.  Punitive
16 damages are simply more money for Ms. Block.
17 They don't go to the American Cancer Society,
18 they don't go to a stop smoking program.  They
19 don't go to the state of Florida.  They don't
20 go anywhere other than Ms. Block.
21       So what were you shown in this trial to
22 get you to award punitive damages?  Well, a lot
23 of what you were shown by the plaintiffs had
24 nothing to do with Ms. Kaplan.
25       You saw ads for brands she never smoked, marketing documents from before her birth,
2 marketing documents talking about 18-year-olds
3 at a time she was in her 40s, 50s, and 60s.
4       You heard about CTR and TI, which she had
5 never heard of.  Nothing to do with her.  And a
6 lot of what you heard just wasn't so or was
7 half the story.
8       When I gave my opening statement, I asked
9 you to keep an open mind until all the evidence
10 was in, and I think you saw some of the reasons
11 for that.
12       So let's go through a handful of those
13 half stories.  And let's start with the
14 Flintstones.  You saw a Winston ad on the
15 Flintstones, and you were probably shocked.
16       Only the video clip, no context, half the
17 story.
18       On cross-examination, we gave you the
19 rest of the story.  The Flintstones were an
20 adult cartoon based on The Honeymooners.  It
21 debuted in prime time, not Saturday morning.
22       The other sponsor was Alka-Seltzer, which
23 is an adult product.  And when it did go to
24 Saturday morning, Reynolds pulled its
25 advertising. Dr. Cummings who told you about this, he
2 knew the context, he knew better, but he
3 concealed that from you.  And we had to fill in
4 the rest of the story.
5       You've already had an instruction on
6 credibility of witnesses, and one of the
7 factors is the frankness of the witness.
8       Was Dr. Cummings frank when he didn't
9 tell the rest of the story?
10       You saw Jed Clampett on The Beverly
11 Hillbillies, and you heard there was a large
12 younger readership.  Half the story.
13       On cross-examination, we told you the
14 rest of the story.  When Reynolds found this
15 out, they pulled its sponsorship.
16       You also heard there was a voluntary
17 Cigarette Advertising Code that set the
18 standards by which they pulled their
19 sponsorship.
20       And from the deposition of Christie
21 Leung, you learned more about that code.  You
22 learned the models must be and look under 25.
23 You learned there should be no ads in magazines
24 with 15 or more percent underage readership.
25 No athletes, no celebrities, limits on sampling practices.
2       When you tie all this together, it
3 doesn't look like an effort to attract kids.
4 Looks like an effort to avoid kids.
5       Dr. Cummings knew this context, he knew
6 it all, but he didn't tell you.  He concealed
7 that.  Frankness.
8       Dr. Cummings talked about the idea that
9 Reynolds needed to attract young kids to be
10 profitable.
11       Well, one of the very marketing documents
12 they showed you belies that argument.  Now,
13 this document right here was supposedly a focus
14 of underage smokers.
15       But guess what?  Go to page 3.  And what
16 page 3 tells us, that Marlboro, the largest
17 cigarette brand in the world, loses almost half
18 its smokers between the ages of 18 and 24.
19       That is a huge target market.  And it's a
20 huge target market among people who have
21 already chosen to use the product.  A much
22 easier target than trying to get a nonsmoker to
23 smoke.
24       Dr. Cummings knew this was there.  But he
25 concealed that from you.  We had to fill in the rest of the story.
2       Frankness.
3       Dr. Cummings told you about the chain of
4 events that he initiated that produced this
5 letter to the principal of Willow Ridge School.
6 It was his idea that the students write to all
7 the cigarette companies, and they did.
8       And he told them to write and ask:  Why
9 do you companies allow your logo to be used on
10 candy cigarettes and toy cars?
11       And there's two points here.  First,
12 Reynolds was the only company courteous enough
13 to reply.  But they replied to the principal,
14 not the students.  The principal did not give
15 it to the students.  She gave it to
16 Dr. Cummings.
17       Now it's used as a trial exhibit all
18 around the country.
19       But here is the ironic part.  You know
20 who showed it to the students?  You heard it on
21 the witness stand.  Dr. Cummings.  He uses it
22 as a trial exhibit, again, all around the
23 country.
24       Second point is, the letter says:  Why do
25 you guys allow your logo to be used on toy cars and candy cigarettes?
2       Fact is, they don't, they never have, and
3 Dr. Cummings knows it.
4       I showed Dr. Cummings a number of
5 letters, a number of letters where Reynolds
6 threatened legal action against those who used
7 their logo on such products.
8       Again, Dr. Cummings knew the context.
9 Dr. Cummings knew better.  He concealed it from
10 you, and we had to show you.  Frankness.
11       Dr. Cummings talked about product
12 placement and suggested that cigarettes were
13 placed in TV shows and movies or events with a
14 high youth viewership.
15       And this was one of the memos they showed
16 you that's supposed to make that point.  Well,
17 look at where they're placing their products,
18 right?
19       The Lucille Ball backgammon tournament.
20 Is that something 14-year-olds flock to?  Or
21 how about trying to have Zsa Zsa Gabor smoke
22 cigarettes on TV?  Do 14-year-old boys have
23 posters of Zsa Zsa Gabor in their rooms?  I
24 don't think so.  Appeals to youth?  Not
25 exactly. Dr. Cummings showed you an interview of
2 the incoming head of R&D at Reynolds,
3 Dr. Robert DiMarco, in 1982.
4       And in that memo, the lawyers were
5 telling Dr. DiMarco that he could not pursue a
6 less mutagenic cigarette, a cigarette that did
7 not cause cancer in the laboratory.
8       And they left it there.  They left it
9 there.  Half the story.
10       On cross-examination, we told the true
11 and full story.  And the true and full story
12 was, beginning a year earlier, in 1981,
13 Reynolds was already developing Premier.  What.
14       Was Premier?  One of the design goals of
15 Premier, which they met, was to produce a less
16 mutagenic cigarette.
17       And that's proven by any battery of tests
18 that you heard that Reynolds conducted, inside
19 and outside the company.
20       Dr. Cummings didn't tell you that
21 Dr. DiMarco won and the lawyers lost.  He knew
22 the context.  He knew better.  But he concealed
23 that from you.
24       We had to fill in the rest of the story.
25 Another example of Dr. Cummings' frankness. Speaking of frank, let's talk about the
2 Frank Statement.
3       Dr. Cummings said that the Frank
4 Statement, which only ran one single day in
5 1954, this was not a recurrent campaign, one
6 single day, somehow this reassured smokers and
7 created confusion among them about the risks of
8 smoking.
9       What Dr. Cummings didn't show you is
10 this.  This was a survey of 400 smokers that
11 said -- didn't reassure people; it scared
12 people.  It scared people into cutting down,
13 and in some cases, stopping.
14       Dr. Cummings knew about this.  He didn't
15 show you.  We did.
16       Now, the word "lying" has been used
17 fairly promiscuously in this courtroom.  Let's
18 take a look at a few of the so-called lies.
19       One of them is that the company's claim
20 the case against cigarettes had not been
21 scientifically proven.
22       First of all, we showed you these
23 epidemiological studies from 1950.  None of
24 them, none of them, concluded smoking caused
25 lung cancer. MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, counsel is not
2 permitted to argue against the findings.
3       THE COURT:  Sustained.
4       You're not allowed to argue against the
5 findings.  Sustained.
6       Come sidebar.
7       (The following discussion was held at
8       sidebar:)
9       MR. KACZYNSKI:  I'm just arguing what the
10 company said. I'm not saying what they said was
11 wrong -- was right.
12       MR. McPHARLIN:  No.  He said, Let's talk
13 about the lies that were supposed to have been
14 made, then he started --
15       THE COURT:  That's the way I took it.
16       Rephrase.  Thank you.
17       (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
18       following was held in open court:)
19       MR. McPHARLIN:  Move to strike,
20 Your Honor?
21       THE COURT:  Counsel, I've already
22 instructed the jury, disregard.
23       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Let's talk about what the
24 companies thought, what evidence you saw about
25 what the companies thought. In 1953, Claude Teague did not say
2 smoking caused lung cancer.  This is what he
3 said in his memo.  It's still unknown.
4       At a meeting of Hill & Knowlton, the
5 company had stated their belief that the
6 National Cancer Institute had refuted such
7 claim.
8       And we showed you the National Cancer
9 Institute study that they were referring to.
10       Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, prominent
11 doctors held the same view.  And these are just
12 some of them.  You've heard what they had to
13 say.
14       And Dr. Spears from Lorillard, in his
15 deposition, explained why the companies held to
16 that position.
17       To them, the classic scientific
18 definition of cause required two things.  It
19 required inhalation experiments that produced
20 human-type lung tumors in animals and
21 identifying the mechanism by which lung cancer
22 developed.
23       And he told you that as of the date of
24 his deposition, the first never happened, and
25 the second had only begun to be understood. Dr. Figlar told you that in 1964, the
2 definition of cause had changed.  It was
3 relaxed.
4       And under that relaxed definition, the
5 Surgeon General's Committee found that smoking
6 caused lung cancer.  And yes, the industry
7 refused to accept that.
8       But did they sincerely believe what they
9 were saying?
10       MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, he is doing
11 exactly what the findings --
12       THE COURT:  Counsel, I don't want to
13 argue sidebar.  All right?  I mean, argue in
14 front of the jury.  Just come sidebar.
15       (The following discussion was held at
16       sidebar:)
17       THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
18       MR. McPHARLIN:  He is arguing that the
19 companies didn't do anything wrong, they didn't
20 conceal anything, and they didn't mislead the
21 public.  They just simply had an honest belief
22 that was different than the Surgeon General.
23       That's the argument he is making.  That
24 is completely against the findings, and he's
25 not allowed to do it. MR. KACZYNSKI:  Your Honor, the findings
2 do not specifically say what it was that was
3 concealed and what was misrepresented.
4       I'm entitled to talk about those things.
5 This is what the companies thought internally.
6 It has nothing to do with the findings.  It's
7 completely independent of the findings.
8       THE COURT:  Counsel, the way it's being
9 displayed to the jury is that it sounds to me
10 like it's arguing against the findings.  That's
11 not acceptable.
12       I'm going to sustain the objection.  Talk
13 about what's in evidence.
14       (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
15       following was held in open court:)
16       MR. KACZYNSKI:  So what's in evidence,
17 you see some memos from the head of one tobacco
18 company to the head of another tobacco company
19 where they express some doubt about the state
20 of the science.
21       Not press releases.  They are not
22 designed for the general public.  It's one
23 person to another person expressing their
24 personal views.
25       You've seen some documents in evidence in this case, one scientist to another,
2 confidential to the company, not for the
3 purpose of the public, where one writes another
4 expressing their personal views.
5       But regardless of what public position
6 they took, what did the companies do
7 internally?
8       Well, what they did is, as you heard from
9 Dr. Robinson, Dr. Spears, and Dr. Figlar by
10 deposition, they took the charges seriously,
11 and they worked to modify the product.
12       First, they worked to identify the
13 chemicals in cigarette smoke.  You heard that
14 Dr. Rodgman from Reynolds was a leader in this.
15 He published on the subject.  And we showed you
16 a speech that he gave on that subject in 1969.
17       Then they tried to eliminate some of
18 those compounds they found that were suspect.
19       You saw one of those documents.  This is
20 one that talks about 120 experiments using half
21 a million cigarettes to lower or reduce a
22 harmful substance in tobacco smoke.
23       You heard that Lorillard worked with
24 Dr. Hoffmann to reduce or eliminate phenols
25 thought to be a cancer cause. Various design changes were formulated,
2 and they were tested internally and with the
3 Tobacco Working Group.
4       The public health community called for
5 filters, and the companies responded.  The
6 public health community called for low tar, and
7 the companies responded.  The public health
8 community called for low tar, medium nicotine,
9 and the companies responded.
10       And years later, Reynolds developed the
11 heat-but-not-burn technology that created
12 Premier and Eclipse, and now e-cigarettes.
13       So even as they stood by their position
14 for the classic definition of causation, they
15 worked to modify the product to make it less
16 hazardous.
17       But even as they maintained this
18 position, they developed Premier, and they
19 spent billions doing it, and they developed
20 Eclipse, which even Dr. Cummings thought was a
21 responsible thing to do, Eclipse and Premier,
22 which he thought were safer alternatives to
23 conventional cigarettes.  And Eclipse is on the
24 market today.
25       So let's clear the air on filters.  No question that prominent scientists like
2 Dr. Wynder encouraged the companies to
3 manufacture filters and advocated for smokers
4 who wouldn't quit to use them.
5       And there is no question that
6 epidemiological studies conducted by people
7 like Dr. Wynder and Dr. Hoffmann concluded that
8 smokers of filter and low tar had lower cancer
9 rates than smokers of non-filters.
10       Remember Dr. Russell in Britain?  Filters
11 save lives.
12       So how does Dr. Cummings then come in
13 here and say filters may, in fact, be more
14 dangerous than non-filters?
15       Well, he had two reasons.  One was he
16 said that new epidemiology after Mrs. Kaplan
17 had quit smoking called the earlier
18 epidemiology into question.
19       Second, though, he said the companies
20 knew that filters were useless and promoted
21 them anyway.
22       What is his proof of that?
23       MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, same argument.
24       THE COURT:  Overruled.
25       MR. KACZYNSKI:  The proof of that is one Philip Morris document that uses the phrase
2 "illusion of filtration."
3       What we've shown about R.J. Reynolds.
4 Well, they showed you a document from 1956
5 about Winston.  It said that filtered Winston
6 had higher levels of polycyclic aromatic
7 hydrocarbons than unfiltered Camels.  What is
8 the rest of the story?
9       This is 1956.  At this point, Winston had
10 been on the market about two years.  What
11 Dr. Cummings in his document didn't show you
12 was this.  This was an alarming result to
13 Reynolds, and they launched a reinvestigation
14 of the Winston blend.  And you were not shown
15 another document of Reynolds that this ever
16 happened again with Winston.
17       What about Lorillard?  You saw ads
18 touting Lorillard's Kent filter.  You heard it
19 was rated as the most effective filter by an
20 outside rating organization.  You heard that
21 was reported in Reader's Digest.  You heard
22 that the Reader's Digest report spiked Kent's
23 sales and that Lorillard exploited the story.
24       What you were not shown by Dr. Cummings
25 was any evidence that Lorillard did not believe everything it said in those Kent filter ads.
2       MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, same argument.
3       MR. KACZYNSKI:  There is no finding about
4 filters, Your Honor.
5       THE COURT:  Excuse me, guys.  I told you
6 before, we're not going to argue this in front
7 of the jury.  Come sidebar, please.
8       (The following discussion was held at
9       sidebar:)
10       THE COURT:  Counsel, let's get this
11 straight.  A couple things.  One is, the
12 findings are the findings.  You can't challenge
13 those findings.
14       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Right.
15       THE COURT:  Excuse me.  The documents
16 that are in evidence are in evidence, and the
17 witness talked about them.  So what the
18 findings basically talk about, that can't be
19 questioned by you, carried the same weight.
20       Concealed or omitted information.  He's
21 talking about documents now that are in
22 evidence.  He's allowed to talk about those
23 documents in evidence, what was said in there.
24       What I don't want to have happen is the
25 argument counsel is saying; these findings are challenged.  That's what I heard before and
2 that's what I sustained before.
3       Be careful now.  I don't want you
4 interrupting his closing all the time.  If he's
5 challenging the documents, and you have a good
6 faith reason to believe he is, raise the
7 objection.  Otherwise, move on.
8       (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
9       following was held in open court:)
10       MR. KACZYNSKI:  After the spike, based on
11 the Reader's Digest article, sales steadily
12 declined.  Now, is it a surprise that Lorillard
13 exploited that story?  Think about it.
14       If Volvo gets an award for highway
15 safety, you think you won't see it in Volvo
16 ads?  If Chevy is named car of the year, you
17 think you won't see that in Chevy ads?  It
18 happens every day.
19       At the end of the day, the facts are
20 these:  Throughout Mrs. Kaplan's lifetime,
21 there was scientific evidence that filters and
22 low tar produced lower cancer rates than
23 non-filters.  During her lifetime, the public
24 health community advocated filters and low tar.
25 During her lifetime, the Cancer Society advocated filters and low tar, and the
2 companies responded.
3       Dr. Cummings told you that the FTC
4 smoking method, the machine, was inaccurate.
5 What he didn't tell you was the companies told
6 the FTC exactly that, back in 1967, when they
7 were considering adopting them.  But the FTC
8 adopted it anyway.  And it later took a step
9 further and required the companies to put those
10 readings in its ads.
11       You didn't hear from Dr. Cummings on
12 direct, but you did on cross, that once upon a
13 time, Lorillard wanted to put higher numbers in
14 its ads.  And the FTC told them no; you've got
15 to put our numbers in, because to do otherwise
16 would be misleading.
17       You saw the Congressional hearings back
18 from 1994.  In fact, they ended Dr. Cummings'
19 direct examination by playing those for you.
20 That was when Congressman Wyden went down the
21 line of CEOs, asking them if nicotine was
22 addictive.
23       One CEO, however, wanted to say more than
24 yes or no, and that was Jim Johnston, the CEO
25 of Reynolds.  He started to say nicotine didn't meet the classical definition of addiction,
2 there is no intoxication.  But Mr. Johnston was
3 ruining Congressman Wyden's sound bite, so he
4 got cut off.
5       We played for you Mr. Johnston's prepared
6 statement to the committee, where he did get to
7 explain himself.  And in his prepared
8 statement, he talked about the classical
9 definition, which included intoxication.  He
10 said smoking could be difficult for some to
11 quit.  He did not simply want to put his
12 customers in the same category as heroin users
13 or alcoholics.
14       Yes, he wouldn't buy into the word
15 "addiction," but he had reasons for it.  Call
16 him stubborn.  But you can't call him anything
17 beyond that.
18       Now, some of the biggest whoppers you
19 were told in this trial dealt with nicotine.
20 Fact:  Reynolds did nicotine research in the
21 '70s and '80s.  Is this a surprise?  And coffee
22 manufacturers, no doubt, do studies into
23 caffeine.
24       According to Dr. Cummings, this research
25 was done to find the minimum level of nicotine to keep smokers hooked.  He showed you some
2 memos with some stupid language from Dr. Teague
3 to this point.
4       But we showed you what was really going
5 on.  We showed you calls by the public health
6 community to develop a low-tar, medium-nicotine
7 cigarette in the 1970s and '80s.  Who made
8 those calls?  These are names you've seen
9 before:  Dr. Russell, Sir Richard Doll,
10 Dr. Jarvik, the co-inventor of the nicotine
11 patch, and in the 1981 Surgeon General's
12 report.
13       The idea was to lower tar, but to
14 maintain nicotine.  The idea is tar is the
15 cancer-causing agent in cigarettes.  Get it
16 down as far as you can; but if you want people
17 to smoke, keep nicotine at a higher level.
18       The theory is smokers would then smoke
19 potentially less-hazardous cigarette.  That's
20 what "how low can you go" was all about.  They
21 were calling for those cigarettes at about the
22 same time Dr. Teague was writing his memos.
23       And that's no coincidence, because we
24 showed you in Reynolds documents that Reynolds
25 was following this research.  They were following Dr. Russell.  So they researched ways
2 to lower the tar while maintaining the
3 nicotine.
4       And they did it in conjunction with the
5 Tobacco Working Group.  You saw those minutes.
6 They researched ways to break the tar/nicotine
7 ratio.  They tried ammonia, they tried
8 levulinic acid, they tried altering pH.  And
9 this was discussed in the Tobacco Working
10 Group, sponsored by the National Cancer
11 Institute.  And you heard testimony of
12 Dr. Robinson that Lorillard did the same thing.
13       In following the recommendations of the
14 Tobacco Working Group to research nicotine
15 levels and develop a less hazardous cigarette,
16 is that punishable conduct?  Is that
17 reprehensible conduct?  That's your call on the
18 issue of punitive damages.
19       And it's true that Reynolds researched
20 the effect of nicotine on the brain in the
21 1980s and 1990s.  Dr. Cummings suggested to you
22 this was for some nefarious purpose.  But
23 again, what is the rest of the story?
24       Well, on cross-examination, Dr. Cummings
25 told us about Targacept.  That's a company that Reynolds spun off in the 1990s, that was headed
2 by one of its R&D scientists, Dr. Don
3 deBethizy, who Dr. Cummings knew.  The whole
4 goal was to use Reynolds' nicotine research to
5 find treatments for Alzheimer's, for
6 Parkinson's, for ADD, and they are awaiting FDA
7 approval for some of their treatments.
8       Reynolds put out a book about nicotine
9 that I showed Dr. Cummings.  He claims he never
10 saw it.  Think about that.  This is the man who
11 claims he knows everything about everything
12 about everything about what the tobacco
13 companies were doing and, in particular, what
14 R.J. Reynolds was doing.
15       But here's a book Reynolds put out in
16 1992, summarizing research of nicotine on the
17 brain, and he claims he never saw it.
18       Really?
19       I went through with him, you may recall,
20 all 13 chapters of this book, many of them
21 authored by Reynolds scientists.  And he
22 admitted that all 13 dealt with the effect of
23 nicotine on the brain.  All 13 were disclosed
24 in this book to the scientific community.
25       On the issue of punitive damages, is doing research that is spun off to a company to
2 treat Alzheimer's, ADD and Parkinson's, and
3 then publishing your research in a book
4 punishable?  Is that reprehensible conduct?
5 That's your call.
6       Dr. Cummings faulted Reynolds for
7 inventing the modern cigarette, because he says
8 it became inhalable, and therefore more
9 addictive.  Well, first of all, it's
10 historically wrong.  Camel was introduced in
11 1913.  We heard that.  And this is a slide that
12 was used during Dr. Cummings' direct
13 examination.
14       This was Florida Health Notes in 1906,
15 before Camel.  And what does it say?  Addictive
16 and inhalable before the modern cigarette was
17 invented.  And this is where the State of
18 Florida concluded, way back in 1906, cigarette
19 smoking is looked upon by all smokers as the
20 worst form of tobacco addiction, and it is
21 inhaled.
22       THE COURT:  Ten minutes, Counsel.
23       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.
24       Think about it, uninhalable cigarettes,
25 really?  What is next?  To prevent cirrhosis, undrinkable booze?  To car accidents,
2 undriveable cars?
3       There are, there have been for hundreds
4 of years a form of tobacco use that you can't
5 inhale.  It's called a cigar.  It's called a
6 cigar.  Smokers expect cigarettes to be
7 inhalable.  And if they don't, they could smoke
8 a cigar.
9       Now, I don't want to suggest to you that
10 Reynolds has engaged in good and proper conduct
11 for the 65 or so years we're talking about
12 here, but they did some.
13       The companies that now comprise Reynolds
14 did cooperate with the public health community.
15 Lorillard cooperated with Dr. Wynder in skin
16 painting.  Lorillard sponsored research at Ohio
17 State University to identify and reduce the
18 constituents of smoke.
19       All companies made submissions to the
20 Surgeon General's advisory commit, page upon
21 page upon page of disclosure there of
22 components of cigarette smoke.
23       The companies provided the Green Monster
24 to the Surgeon General's Committee, used by the
25 committee.  Lorillard worked with Dr. Hoffmann on phenols.  Dr. Rodgman published and gave
2 speeches on constituents.  RJR and Lorillard
3 participated in the Tobacco Working Group.
4 Lorillard worked with the Institute of Medicine
5 on lower-exposure products.  Reynolds published
6 its book on nicotine, and Reynolds hosted
7 scientific conferences on Eclipse.
8       Should the companies have accepted the
9 consensus that smoking caused disease sooner
10 than they did?  Probably.  Should they have not
11 criticized the Surgeon General every time a
12 report came out?  Clearly not.  Were they too
13 stubborn accepting the Surgeon General's
14 changed definition of addiction?  Maybe.
15       But to the extent you think there is a
16 need for Reynolds to be punished, that has
17 already happened; such that there is no reason
18 to give additional money to Ms. Block to
19 achieve that goal.
20       And you heard from Dr. Cummings in
21 relationship to the Master Settlement Agreement
22 and the Florida settlement agreement.
23       MR. McPHARLIN:  Judge, that's improper
24 argument.
25       THE COURT:  Overruled. MR. KACZYNSKI:  Under these agreements,
2 1997 for Florida and a few other states, and
3 1998 for the rest, the Tobacco Institute was
4 shut down, CTR was shut down, documents were
5 disclosed, billboards are gone.  Reynolds pays
6 millions of dollars every year to every state
7 in perpetuity, forever.
8       And now, on account of its mergers,
9 Reynolds pays the share of Brown & Williamson
10 and Lorillard as well.
11       Punishment has happened, and will happen
12 forever.  There's no need for additional
13 punishment in this case by giving additional
14 money to Ms. Block.
15       And the other purpose of punitive damages
16 is deterrence; to deter Reynolds and others
17 from engaging in future misconduct.  Let's see
18 whether there's a need to award Ms. Block more
19 money for the purposes of deterrence.
20       Where does Reynolds find itself in the
21 21st Century?  Well, you heard from
22 Dr. Cummings, they are regulated by the FDA.
23 This is new.  They developed Premier and
24 Eclipse.  Dr. Cummings thinks these are great,
25 and safer than conventional cigarettes. A sister company of Reynolds manufactures
2 Zonnic.  Zonnic is in the marketplace,
3 FDA-approved, a nicotine gum, a stop smoking
4 aid.  Sold in convenience stores alongside
5 cigarettes, in packs like cigarettes.
6 Dr. Cummings thinks this is a great business
7 model.
8       Reynolds manufactures Vuse, an
9 e-cigarette.  Dr. Cummings says e-cigarettes is
10 a good things.  It's a way for a smoker to
11 obtain nicotine without -- and this is his
12 word, not mine -- all the crap.
13       You heard that Reynolds refitted tobacco
14 barns, to use a different kind of heat for
15 curing, heat exchange instead of propane.  And
16 it reduced carcinogens in tobacco by
17 95 percent.  Reynolds published about this
18 development, and it paid for 1,200 tobacco
19 barns to be refitted with the new technology.
20       Reynolds has a website.  This website
21 says there is no safe tobacco products.  It
22 says quitting reduces the risk.  It advises
23 smokers concerned about their smoking to quit.
24       Did you ever think you would see a
25 tobacco company advising people to quit?  Well, Reynolds does.
2       Instead of criticizing the Surgeon
3 General, it directs people to the Surgeon
4 General and public health organizations for
5 advice, and gives them links on how to get
6 there.  And it lists the ingredients for any
7 brands or any style of cigarettes.
8       And it maintains a document website.  It
9 contains Reynolds documents produced in
10 litigation so that, after this trial is over,
11 when the judge clears you of your obligation
12 not to do your own research, you can do your
13 own research on these websites to find
14 documents just like you saw in this trial.
15       This is the environment the companies are
16 in in the 21st Century.  If you feel they
17 weren't sufficiently regulated in the past,
18 they are now.  If you think they weren't making
19 safer cigarettes in the past, they are now.
20       If you think they weren't doing anything
21 to help people quit in the past, they are now.
22 If you're concerned about transparency, you can
23 go to the document databases.  And if you take
24 all these factors, together with the punishment
25 forever in the Master Settlement Agreement, millions of dollars per year per state, there
2 is no need for punitive damages, there is no
3 need for more money for Ms. Block, there's no
4 need to come back for yet another session and
5 more witnesses and more argument.
6       So we're asking you to check "no" on this
7 part of the verdict form.
8       Time to wrap up.
9       This is the only chance I get to talk to
10 you.  Plaintiff has the burden of proof.  I sit
11 down, they get a rebuttal.  In this case, a
12 fairly lengthy one.  I don't know what is going
13 to be said.  We don't get to respond.  That's
14 the way it works.  He may say something that I
15 could have responded to in this argument; he
16 may have said something that could have been
17 responded to earlier.
18       But if any of that happens, what I would
19 ask you to do, think about how we would have
20 responded.  Think about how we would have
21 answered them during the course of your
22 deliberations.
23       I want to thank you for your service and
24 for your attention.  And bottom line once again
25 is, we couldn't have done this without you. Thank you very much.
2       Thank you, Your Honor.
