10       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Ms. Block.  Counsel.
11 Good afternoon.
12       JURORS:  Good afternoon.
13       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Well, this is really the
14 last time I'm going to speak with you, because
15 this is the last verdict you are going to
16 render in this case.
17       I am not going to reargue what happened
18 in Phase I.  I'm not going to throw up slides
19 of old documents.  I'm not going to show you
20 any documents or slides.  I just want to talk
21 to you.
22       And what I want to talk to you about -- I
23 guess the basic message I've heard between
24 Mr. McPharlin's opening in this phase and
25 Mr. Rosen's closing is nothing's changed, and they still sell cigarettes.
2       Well, yes, they do.  My client is first
3 and foremost a cigarette manufacturer.
4       And you've heard instruction in Phase I,
5 and it's true in Phase II, they cannot be held
6 liable.  They cannot be punished for the mere
7 act of selling cigarettes.
8       But to say nothing's changed, I think you
9 would have to forget everything you heard
10 yesterday afternoon from Dr. Garner.  Because
11 he spent yesterday afternoon telling you that
12 that just ain't so; things have changed.
13       So rather than dwell on what happened in
14 Phase I and reargue Phase I, let me talk to you
15 about the Reynolds of the 21st century, as
16 Dr. Garner did.
17       In the 21st century, R.J. Reynolds
18 Tobacco Company advises smokers worried about
19 their health to quit.
20       Did you ever think you'd hear a tobacco
21 company doing that?  That's certainly something
22 that's changed.
23       And in the Reynolds family of companies,
24 they manufacture Zonnic, a nicotine gum to help
25 people quit, to help them achieve that goal if that's what they want to do.  That's changed.
2       They've gotten FDA approval for Zonnic,
3 and they sell it in convenience stores and gas
4 stations right alongside cigarettes.
5       And yesterday, I think, you heard some
6 criticism of that marketing plan.
7       But you know who you didn't hear it from?
8 You didn't hear it from Dr. Cummings who had
9 all kinds of bad things to say about my client.
10 But said that he thought that's a good
11 marketing plan.  He liked that.  And that's how
12 Reynolds is doing it.
13       In the 21st century, Reynolds discloses
14 its ingredients and its additives.  Since -- in
15 the 1980s, it's done that to the Department of
16 Health and Human Services.
17       And it discloses them not only on a list,
18 but by brand recipe.  What is a brand recipe?
19 That's what makes Kentucky Fried Chicken finger
20 lickin' good.  That's what makes Coke different
21 from Pepsi.  That's what competitors want.
22       And by law, they have to provide that to
23 the FDA, and they do.
24       But not only to the Health and Human
25 Services and not only to the FDA, but to their smokers on their website.  Want to know what
2 kind of ingredients or additives are in your
3 brand of cigarette?  You can look it up on the
4 website.
5       And despite all the accusations we heard
6 in Phase I, despite all the innuendo about
7 additives and ingredients, the Department of
8 Health and Human Services and, more recently,
9 the Food and Drug Administration, although they
10 have the authority to do so, have never told
11 Reynolds to change a thing, to take an additive
12 out.
13       In the 21st century, Reynolds tells
14 smokers to refer to the Surgeon General or the
15 Centers for Disease Control or any one of
16 another variety of public health authorities
17 for information on tobacco.
18       Maybe in the 20th century they were in
19 the business of trying to talk about a
20 certain -- their certain view of the science.
21 Not anymore.
22       In the 21st century, they are saying:
23 Go look at these public health authorities and
24 get that information.  And they provide links
25 on their website where people can find it. In the 21st century, Reynolds makes
2 disclosures.  It makes disclosures on its
3 website.  It makes disclosures to the FDA.
4 Dr. Garner told you yesterday that just in the
5 few years of FDA regulation, they have
6 disclosed millions, millions of pages of
7 documents.
8       You heard about the FDA's regulatory
9 authority over nicotine and additives and
10 ingredients.
11       Today, in the 21st century, Reynolds
12 can't change anything about its product without
13 approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
14 And it's Dr. Garner's full-time job to ensure
15 compliance with those regulations.
16       In the 21st century, Reynolds offers
17 smokers alternatives that they never had
18 before.
19       You heard about Premier and Eclipse.
20 Heat-but-not-burn technology.  And you saw on
21 the charts the dramatic reductions in
22 cancer-causing substances in those brands.
23 That's progress.  And Dr. Cummings said they're
24 safer.
25       They offer smokeless tobacco in Snus, which is a reduction in lung cancer risk.
2       They offer them e-cigarettes.  And
3 which -- e-cigarettes, which even Dr. Cummings
4 says are safer than conventional cigarettes.
5       R.J. Reynolds is part of the Reynolds
6 family that's doing many good things today in
7 the 21st century.
8       In Phase I, you heard about Targacept.
9 Targacept, remember, is the company that
10 Reynolds spun off in the 1990s, so they could
11 use the nicotine research that they had done.
12       You'd seen on documents that it was
13 suggested it was done for some nefarious
14 purpose.
15       They spun that research off into a
16 separate company headed by a Reynolds scientist
17 to try to find treatments for Parkinson's, for
18 Alzheimer's, and for ADD.
19       And yesterday, you heard about
20 something -- maybe you didn't expect to hear
21 about a sister company called Kentucky
22 BioProcessing.
23       But they don't make cigarettes.  They
24 don't make a product.  They investigate what
25 you can do with the tobacco leaf. And amazingly, one of the things they can
2 do with the tobacco leaf is to develop a cure
3 for the Ebola virus, something that has been
4 actually used to save lives.
5       This isn't a theory.  This isn't
6 speculation.  The Ebola virus has saved lives
7 and is saving them today.
8       Dr. Garner told you about the two
9 Americans who are on the front lines fighting
10 the Ebola virus in Africa, who unfortunately
11 contracted it from the people they were
12 treating.
13       They came to the United States.  They
14 were hospitalized.  They were treated with
15 ZMapp, which is the name of the drug that
16 Kentucky BioProcessing developed.
17       They were treated with ZMapp, and they
18 were cured and they walked out of the hospital
19 alive.  That's what is going on in the 21st
20 century.
21       You heard earlier, and you heard
22 yesterday in the opening, Reynolds merged with
23 Lorillard, that is correct, recently.  They
24 picked up Newport, a menthol brand.  You just
25 saw that now, and that's true.  Somehow there was something wrong about that.
2       What you didn't hear that Dr. Garner told
3 you when I asked him the questions, that they
4 had to finance this merger.
5       And in doing that, they sold off a number
6 of brands, but they included all their
7 standalone menthol brands.  They sold off Kool,
8 and they sold off Salem, which was their
9 standard brand going back into 1950.  They sold
10 them to another tobacco company to get the cash
11 to fund the merger.
12       But, however, that merger brought them a
13 menthol brand, which is now the only standalone
14 brand they got, and that's Newport.
15       You heard yesterday that Reynolds has
16 been paying states millions of dollars every
17 year under the Master Settlement Agreement and
18 the Florida Settlement Agreement.
19       And make no mistake about it, Reynolds,
20 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the defendant in
21 this case, signs those checks.
22       And you heard yesterday from Dr. Garner,
23 those checks have amounted to something like
24 $52 billion in punishment since the agreements
25 were signed.  And that obligation will last forever.
2       You heard that Reynolds pays the FDA for
3 its own regulation.  That obligation will last
4 forever.
5       You've heard that Reynolds has already
6 paid millions of dollars in punitive damage
7 awards across the state of Florida, and there
8 are thousands of cases that are yet to go to
9 trial.
10       Now, you have options in this case.
11 Having made the point that punitive damages are
12 warranted, you can decline to award them.  You
13 can.  That's one of your options.
14       Having fully compensated Ms. Block in
15 Phase I for her loss, you can decline to give
16 her more money in Phase II.
17       If you do choose to award punitive
18 damages, as we asked you in Phase I and you
19 were, we asked you to be reasonable.
20       Remember that any award you make will be
21 paid by the Reynolds of the 21st century and
22 not the 20th.
23       And I told you in opening I was going to
24 offer you a few suggestions, and here they are.
25       As you recall when this lawsuit belonged to Mrs. Kaplan before she passed away, we
2 showed you that interrogatory response where
3 she was only asking for medical fees, medical
4 expenses, and you awarded them in Phase I.  And
5 that was about $200,000.
6       If you feel punitive damages are
7 warranted, award them again.  Award them again.
8 Award $200,000.
9       If you don't feel that's adequate, I've
10 got another option for you.  Your verdict form
11 from yesterday in effect awarded a million
12 dollars, and you split responsibility 50/50.
13       If you feel the need to award punitive
14 damages, award the other 50 percent.  Award a
15 half a million dollars.
16       Either one would be reasonable under the
17 circumstances.  And as with Phase I -- as with
18 Phase I, whatever you decide, we will respect
19 your verdict.
20       You've worked hard.  We've noticed you've
21 bonded.  We all know that jury service is a
22 sacrifice.  And I would join with Mr. Rosen and
23 say I hope it was an educational experience.
24       I want to thank you for your service.
25 Thank you for your time. And, again, I've said it a half dozen
2 times before, I'll say it again, this system
3 could not work without you.
4       So on behalf of my client, on behalf of
5 my colleagues, we appreciate your service.  We
6 thank you very much.
7       Thank you, Your Honor.
