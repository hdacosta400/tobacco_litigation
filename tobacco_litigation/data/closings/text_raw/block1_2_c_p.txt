8       MR. ROSEN:  Counsel.  Sharon.  And ladies
9 and gentlemen of the jury, good afternoon.
10       JURORS:  Good afternoon.
11       MR. ROSEN:  I'm used to saying "good
12 morning," but we're starting in the afternoon,
13 and so I had to think about that before I said
14 it.
15       First, I want to thank you.  I haven't
16 had an opportunity to say thank you for your
17 time and for your effort and for your
18 consideration.  And on behalf of everyone, and
19 on behalf of Sharon and Lillian, thank you for
20 your verdict.  Truly.
21       And we are really grateful to have jurors
22 like yourselves to sit and give us your time
23 and sacrifice for us and for the system.  And
24 so we really appreciate it.
25       This phase is different than the first phase, which is about compensatory damages and
2 about liability.  This phase is about
3 punishment.
4       You, by your verdict, said by clear and
5 convincing evidence, punitive damages for their
6 conduct is warranted.  That's what your verdict
7 said.
8       And I want to make clear one thing right
9 up front is that we are not asking you by any
10 means to punish these lawyers.  We're not
11 asking any of that.  Ms. Baker, Mr. Gordon,
12 Mr. Kaczynski, these are fine lawyers,
13 professionals.  We have cooperated together
14 during this trial, and we are colleagues.  So
15 we're not asking you to punish them or anything
16 that they did during this trial.
17       We are asking you to look at the company
18 they represent, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
19       And you heard a number of different
20 companies that Dr. Garner mentioned yesterday,
21 Niconovum and some other companies.
22       We are talking about R.J. Reynolds
23 Tobacco Company.  So that's what I'm going to
24 focus on during this phase, and what they did
25 and their conduct. And part of some of the evidence that was
2 presented is they are a changed corporation.
3       THE COURT:  Excuse me one second.  The
4 notepad?
5       THE BAILIFF:  Joanna, do you have the
6 thing for number 2?
7       THE COURT:  Mr. Rosen, I apologize.
8       MR. ROSEN:  No problem.
9       THE COURT:  Is that right, ma'am?
10       THE BAILIFF:  I need a pen.  Sorry about
11 that.
12       MR. ROSEN:  That's okay.
13       THE BAILIFF:  Excuse me.
14       MR. ROSEN:  And so they say they are a
15 changed company.  We're going to talk about
16 that in a little bit.
17       But regardless of whatever they've been
18 forced to comply with now, as far as FDA and as
19 far as the Master Settlement Agreement, we are
20 talking about 50 years of conduct that they
21 engaged in before coming up right up until
22 2000, because with respect to Lillian Kaplan,
23 they have never been punished for that conduct.
24       And so Mr. Kaczynski said to you in
25 opening, in his opening statement for this phase, that he contacted his client and they
2 heard your verdict.  Punitive damages, the
3 verdict that you're going to give, they are not
4 supposed to just hear it.  They need to feel
5 it.  They need to feel it, because that is how
6 we change and we make changes in our society,
7 okay; because we don't accept and we will not
8 accept the conduct, the reprehensible conduct
9 that they engaged in for the amount of time
10 that they engaged in it and the harm that they
11 have caused.
12       So in order for the punishment -- in
13 order for them to be punished, it must be
14 significant.  It must be significant, or they
15 will not feel it.  They may hear it.  They will
16 not feel it, and they will not listen.  So that
17 is how we make changes.
18       And so part of what we're going to talk
19 about is punishment, part of what we're going
20 to talk about is deterring other companies from
21 engaging in the same type of conduct that
22 they've done in the past and deterring
23 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company from engaging in
24 the same type of conduct that they have in the
25 past. I joke -- you know, I said to you -- I've
2 said it twice, I think, in jury selection and
3 opening statement, that you could probably get
4 college credits for the information that you've
5 learned in this trial.  And you have learned a
6 lot of information.  Probably more than a
7 semester's worth of information on the history
8 of the tobacco companies, about the corporate
9 conduct of the tobacco companies, about
10 nicotine, about nicotine addiction, about the
11 way they design their products.
12       You have learned so much information.  I
13 would suspect that you truly, sitting here now,
14 have probably more information about the
15 cigarette industry and about tobacco products
16 and the products they sell and about their
17 conduct, probably more than 95, 99 percent of
18 the U.S. population.
19       You have that information.  That
20 information is powerful.  That information is
21 powerful, and what you can do in this
22 courtroom, you have the power to make changes
23 and to make a difference.
24       You can let R.J. Reynolds know that their
25 conduct is not -- will not be tolerated.  And it's not acceptable, and they can be held
2 accountable and responsible in this courtroom.
3       The CEO of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
4 they can know and feel what this verdict is
5 tomorrow or later this afternoon, because they
6 will learn about it.
7       And other companies.  If it's significant
8 and it's appropriate and it's reasonable, other
9 companies will learn, and they will hear about
10 it, and they will think twice to engage in the
11 kind of conduct that they engaged in.
12       And for the conduct that we're going to
13 talk about -- and I'm going to bring it up in a
14 minute -- it can't be a slap on the wrist.  It
15 can't be, because they won't feel it.  And it
16 won't cause change, and it won't make a
17 difference to them.
18       The corporations cannot put profit over
19 human life.  That's what they did; the most
20 reprehensible of all conduct.
21       Corporations are treated like
22 individuals, and individuals are supposed to
23 act with integrity.
24       I think I said a quote earlier in trial
25 is that, you know, a true test of a man's integrity is what they do when no one is
2 watching.  And what they did when no one was
3 watching is beyond -- beyond disturbing, beyond
4 belief.
5       And they said they are changed.  I'm
6 going to talk about that in a minute.
7       You know, here -- this is what they said
8 back in 1982:  We cannot ever be comfortable
9 selling a product which most of our customers
10 would stop using if they could.  That is to
11 say, if the exit gate from our market should
12 suddenly open, we could be out of business
13 almost overnight.
14       What are they selling?  It hasn't
15 changed.  They're still selling the same
16 cigarettes.  They just bought a new product,
17 Newport, the highest-selling menthol cigarette
18 in the United States.
19       All their growth brands.  And Snus, all
20 of them nicotine delivery devices.  They cannot
21 be comfortable selling a product that does not
22 sustain addiction, because they would be out of
23 business overnight.
24       That's what this design is.  That's what
25 their products are. And who do they target?  And we know from
2 their records, they target children.  They
3 target kids.  Because that is the base of their
4 business.
5       And you have all of the documents back
6 there, and you can look at them and you can
7 read through them.  The growth and decline of
8 every major brand hinges on the youth market.
9 It hasn't changed.
10       You know, I showed you a magazine, a
11 Rolling Stone magazine with Kim Kardashian on
12 the cover.  What magazine is that for?  It's
13 for kids.  It's for 13-, 14-, 15-year-old kids
14 who like rock and roll and music and Kim
15 Kardashian and Bravo channel.
16       Whatever it may be, that's what it's
17 directed to.  That's who they want.  That's the
18 base of their business.  It hasn't changed.
19       So you can make a difference.
20       This is their market, their growth
21 brands.  They told you about this migration
22 strategy.  We will talk more about it later on.
23       But what is their growth brand?  Their
24 growth brand is -- R.J. Reynolds focuses its
25 marketing support on Camel and Pall Mall, now Newport as well, to accelerate the brand's
2 market share growth and to drive the brands for
3 long-term accelerated growth and profit.
4       R.J. Reynolds is in the business of
5 selling cigarettes.  It's their profits.  And
6 we are going to talk about what their profits
7 are from selling cigarettes.  But that is what
8 they do.
9       It's not about migrating a customer to
10 Niconovum, Zonnic gum or to some other -- Vuse.
11 They don't want to migrate that, because what
12 happens when they migrate to those, they don't
13 make profits, and R.J. Reynolds goes out of
14 business.
15       What did Dr. Garner admit to you on the
16 stand?  This is what they're growing.  This is
17 R.J. Reynolds, not the other companies.
18 R.J. Reynolds is growing these brands for
19 long-term gains.
20       And the growth doesn't stop.  They
21 continue to grow.
22       They just subsumed another major tobacco
23 company, Lorillard Tobacco Company.  It was
24 just merged into R.J. Reynolds to make them
25 more powerful, to give them higher market share.
2       They may have sold off some other brands,
3 but they are focusing on these and streamlining
4 it.  And Camel and the Camel Crush that you
5 saw, that you pop the filter and it gives a
6 menthol flavor.  Pall Mall, which is their
7 low-priced cigarette.
8       And you read -- this is in evidence, but
9 you look at Newport, what their goals are for
10 Newport, Camel, Pall Mall.
11       And then look at what they talk about
12 Snus.  Snus is about a half a sentence.  And it
13 talks about, well, this is something our adult
14 consumers can use, because they don't have to
15 spit and it's modern.  That's what they say.
16       And you know what?  Within R.J. Reynolds,
17 if they're truly migrating from cigarettes to
18 Snus, they're migrating people from lung cancer
19 to mouth cancer.  Because both of them cause
20 cancer, disease and death.  And it doesn't end.
21       This is the history of this company, and
22 this is a confession, and they wrote it
23 internally, and they knew.  And this goes back
24 to 1978, talking about the conspiracy and their
25 goals. Our basic position in the cigarette
2 controversy is subject to the charge and may be
3 subject to a finding we are making false and
4 misleading statements to promote the sale of
5 cigarettes.
6       They knew it.  They knew it.  And we're
7 going to talk about levels of conduct and
8 reprehensibility and intent and a mind-set.
9       They knew what they were doing.  They
10 knew they could be caught, but they forged
11 forward ahead.  Deliberately.  Premeditatively.
12 Forged ahead to sell cigarettes and make profit
13 while they knew people were dying.
14       The millions of people that have died
15 since the 1960s from cigarette smoking, the
16 number one preventable cause of death in the
17 United States, they knew it.  They denied it.
18       And they kept selling this product for
19 profit, and they lied, and they went public and
20 they lied and they concealed information.
21       And your verdict told us that, and it
22 affected Lillian.  It affected Lillian.
23       This is another important document.  You
24 have it back there, you can look at it.  It's a
25 key document.  It's a window into their mind-set.
2       They talk about for nearly 20 years --
3 now, they're in the early '70s.  For nearly 20
4 years, this industry has employed a single
5 strategy.
6       The strategy was brilliantly conceived
7 and executed to win important battles.  They
8 boasted internally about what they were doing,
9 that they were winning.
10       And you know what?  They say it wasn't a
11 vehicle for victory; it was a holding strategy.
12       1972, and it continued on into the 1980s,
13 it continued on into the 1990s, right up until
14 2000.  You heard them take the stand and say:
15 We didn't admit it until 2000.  2000.
16       The holding strategy to keep people
17 smoking and people are -- keep -- people keep
18 dying.  A holding strategy.
19       I mean, with the amount of untold
20 suffering and souls that are lost throughout
21 those years, their goal is a holding strategy,
22 so people keep buying, people keep dying,
23 people keep getting sick.
24       And they keep making profits, more and
25 more profits.  It's the most heinous of conduct.
2       So you're going to be given an
3 instruction about levels of conduct in making
4 your determination about punitive damages.  The
5 levels.
6       It says, "In making this determination,
7 you should consider the following:  The nature,
8 extent and degree of misconduct and the related
9 circumstances."
10       So if we're on a scale and we're talking
11 about what's the least worse conduct and what
12 is the most reprehensible, heinous conduct, you
13 look at these scales.  The nature -- the nature
14 of this conduct from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
15 Company:  Intentional, deliberate,
16 premeditated.
17       They ran the red light, and they knew
18 people were coming, into a busy intersection.
19 That's not careless, that's not negligent,
20 that's not reckless; it's the highest degree of
21 focused intent to sell cigarettes, make profit,
22 knowing people are dying throughout this
23 country.
24       The extent -- the nature, extent and
25 degree.  Extent.  50 years, over 50 years.  And I'll suggest to you they continue to do it
2 today.  They are doing it today.
3       And they've never acknowledged what
4 they've done.  Never, not one -- they've never
5 acknowledged their conduct has harmed one
6 person.
7       Fifty years, it's the highest.  On that
8 scale, it's the highest.
9       And degree.  Conduct that causes
10 suffering and death.  It's the most on that
11 scale.  You can't get worse than that.
12       Catastrophic diseases they created in
13 this country.  We showed you the line -- I
14 don't have to go through it again, but we
15 showed you the chart.
16       They created lung cancer.  It didn't
17 exist.  They created it, and they sustained it.
18 And lung cancer and chronic obstructive
19 pulmonary disease, emphysema, heart disease,
20 every one of them, long-term, debilitating,
21 horrible.
22       And you heard the Surgeon General say in
23 1988 -- I think there was a video we played --
24 there's no such thing as a quality death.
25 Lillian Kaplan did not have a quality death. Cancer.  Lung cancer.  What happens with
2 cancer?
3       And this is what Dr. Villa said.  It's a
4 loss of control of the cells.  It grows without
5 limits.
6       This was in her lung.  It becomes
7 immortal.  If you take those cells and put it
8 on a dish, it can grow forever.  Every cell has
9 a mechanism to grow, stabilize and die.
10       Cancer cells lose that ability.  That's
11 what makes cancer, immortality and freedom to
12 grow.  It grows into organs, into blood,
13 through tissue, through bone.  It sees no
14 limits until the person is dead.
15       That's what they sold.  That's what they
16 created.  It's the highest degree, the first
17 degree, number one.
18       And so what is appropriate, reasonable
19 punishment for this conduct, for this conduct
20 that we're talking about in this case to punish
21 R.J. Reynolds and to deter -- to punish
22 R.J. Reynolds, to deter R.J. Reynolds, and to
23 let other companies know they can't act this
24 way, ever?
25       We played you a video of Dr. Raffa, and I played it for an important purpose, and it's to
2 show you what their net earnings are from the
3 sale of cigarettes in this country.
4       And in 2013 -- and so we need to
5 understand that net revenue is the sale of
6 cigarettes.  Whatever that total amount is that
7 they make from selling cigarettes, you subtract
8 from that everything.
9       Every operating expense you can think of
10 from the cost of the tobacco, from the cost of
11 manufacturing, the cost of transporting the
12 goods, overhead, rent, mortgages, utility,
13 salaries of the CEOs and the employees and the
14 bonuses that they make and the golden
15 parachutes for the CEOs.
16       You subtract all of it.  Administrative
17 expenses, the MSA, what they pay to them, the
18 FDA, you subtract all of it.  And you come down
19 to -- and subtract taxes from that.
20       And then you have what is called the
21 after-tax net profit, their net earnings, the
22 net earnings.
23       And this company in 2013, $1.6 billion
24 that year.  And if you break that down to a
25 daily average, you are talking about $4.4 million in profit every day.  Every day.
2       Every day we sat here in this courtroom,
3 according to these numbers, $4.4 million a day
4 they are earning from the sale of cigarettes.
5 Every day.
6       $1 million or $2 million or $3 million is
7 not going to get this company's attention.
8 They're not going to feel it.
9       You're going to be asked one question on
10 the jury verdict form, one question only:  What
11 is the appropriate amount, if any?
12       You've decided it's warranted.  You need
13 to let them know.  And we're asking you to let
14 them know with the information and the power
15 that you have today in this courtroom after
16 several weeks of listening to evidence, hearing
17 testimony and knowing the conduct of these
18 companies.
19       We suggest to you a fair number that this
20 company will feel and they will know that you
21 are sending them a message that this conduct is
22 improper and truly reprehensible and our
23 community won't stand for it.  $5 million.
24 $5 million.  Not more.
25       This is the number we feel is appropriate.  That's about -- a little more
2 than one day of their profit.  We've been here
3 for about a day for the punitive damage phase.
4 One day of your time.  One day of their profit.
5       Thank you.


10       MR. ROSEN:  Thank you, Your Honor.
11       Kentucky BioProcessing.  They saved one
12 doctor.
13       That's not R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
14 That's a different company.  That's not the
15 folks that engaged in the conduct that
16 R.J. Reynolds had engaged in for 50, 60,
17 70 years.
18       Okay.  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
19 their product kills 450,000, 500,000 Americans
20 every year, every year.
21       Kentucky BioProcessing saves one person,
22 and their product is killing 450 to 500,000
23 every year.
24       Congratulations.  They're changed.
25 They're doing great things.  Great things in the United States for the American public.
2       And, you know, he talks about that
3 R.J. Reynolds, they voluntarily -- they
4 disclosed all this stuff.  We've paid money to
5 the states, and we deal with the FDA.
6       That wasn't voluntary.  They were forced
7 to do that.  They had to do it.
8       You heard Dr. Garner talk about, when I
9 asked about the MSA, this Master Settlement
10 Agreement, they were getting sued by 46 of the
11 50 states in America.
12       They had nowhere to go.  Their backs were
13 against the wall.  They had to settle.  They
14 had to get out.
15       And they got out cheap.  He talks 46 or
16 $50 billion they paid over the 20 years.  You
17 heard that the cost of healthcare every year in
18 the U.S. is over $140 billion.
19       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, not in
20 evidence.
21       THE COURT:  Sustained.
22       You are to rely on your own recollection
23 of the evidence.
24       MR. ROSEN:  I asked him, and he had no
25 idea what the actual cost from cigarettes and the devastation that it does to human beings in
2 this country.  He had no idea what that amount
3 was.  No idea.
4       You know, they talk about the
5 R.J. Reynolds of today.  It's too little.  It's
6 too late.  And it's too late for Lillian.
7 She's not here.
8       The Master Settlement Agreement.  They
9 were forced to dissolve the TI and TIRC.  They
10 had it right up until 1999.  Those
11 organizations that they spent millions and
12 millions of dollars to fund fake science and
13 public relations.
14       They were forced to do it.  They didn't
15 do it voluntarily.  They probably wouldn't be
16 here today if they weren't forced with their
17 backs up against the wall.
18       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
19       THE COURT:  Sustained.
20       MR. ROSEN:  It's not voluntary when
21 you're forced.
22       The Master Settlement Agreement.
23 Dr. Garner didn't say a single penny of that
24 has gone to the victims of the disease and
25 suffering from smoking their cigarettes.  Or in the Engle lawsuits.  He talked about, you know,
2 the -- I think 3,000 lawsuits that are pending
3 in the state of Florida.
4       He laughed when I said how long it would
5 take to get those cases resolved.  Decades, if
6 not hundreds of years, to get those cases
7 resolved.  It took Lillian Kaplan over seven
8 years.  She died.  She never got to see her day
9 in court.  She didn't make it.
10       And you think about these folks who are
11 part of that class, the 3,000 people, the
12 untold suffering from each of those families
13 and those victims, and of cases that are
14 pending, that are waiting, that will take
15 decades, and they may not live, like Lillian
16 Kaplan, to ever see their day in court.
17       You know, when he asked:  Well, have we
18 been punished?  Has R.J. Reynolds been
19 punished?
20       And Dr. Garner says:  Yes, we've paid
21 punitive damages.
22       You know what he didn't tell you, he
23 didn't tell you the amount.  He didn't tell you
24 what it was.
25       Don't you think if it was significant, if they felt it, they would have a number, that he
2 would have researched and looked at that number
3 and told you, this is how much we've already
4 paid to the victims in punitive damages.
5       He didn't tell you because it's not
6 significant to them.  It wasn't significant.
7       Surgeon General Reports.  Well, we put it
8 on our website, and we tell you folks to -- we
9 tell our consumers to take a look, this is
10 where you should look for information about
11 smoking and health.
12       I asked him:  Do you rely on it?
13       He said:  Well, some things I do, and
14 other things I don't agree with.
15       Do you have the pointer?  Thank you.
16       You know, this nicotine book that you saw
17 here they put into evidence, The Biology of
18 Nicotine.  You know what?  That was 1992.
19       This is 1998, the Surgeon General Report.
20 You saw it.  They put it on a slide yesterday.
21 All about nicotine addiction.  1988.
22       They're saying:  Well, we didn't conceal
23 anything because in 1992, we put all this
24 information in these studies about nicotine.
25       You know what?  Take a look at that book and see if you can understand a word of it.
2 Because it's part of this whole thing.
3       Even after they spent whatever amount of
4 money or time in putting that book together,
5 they went in front of Congress and they lied
6 and denied, nicotine in cigarettes are not
7 addictive.
8       Even though the Surgeon General a number
9 of years before said -- in this entire book,
10 they studied it.
11       And you know what this book represented?
12 This book represented the Surgeon General and
13 public health finally catching up with what the
14 tobacco companies knew for decades, that their
15 product was highly addictive.  And that people
16 couldn't stop.
17       People were hooked.  People were getting
18 hooked as kids, children like Lillian Kaplan at
19 12 years old buying candy cigarettes.
20       They knew it, and they denied it.  You
21 take a look and see if you can even find the
22 word "addiction" in that book.  It's not there.
23       Because this, like the other information
24 that they provided the public, is vague and
25 irksome to the reader.  You can't even understand it.
2       You know what?  I tabbed out some things.
3 We can look at some of the conclusions about
4 what is in that book.
5       Conclusion:  It is currently not
6 possible, without additional study, to predict
7 the exact manner in which nicotine might alter
8 neuronal responsiveness to other agents.
9       It's constant.  It's never-ending.  We
10 need more research.  We don't understand.  You
11 know, we just need more research.  We'll find
12 out the issue.
13       FDA regulation, that was a law that was
14 passed.  Because they couldn't regulate
15 themselves.  They went unregulated for 70,
16 80 years.
17       And he talked about:  We can't make a
18 single change with our cigarettes unless we get
19 FDA approval.
20       They love it.  They love it.  You want to
21 know why?  Because they spent 70 years
22 perfecting that design.  Perfecting it,
23 engineering it, studying it.  And now they have
24 the perfect nicotine delivery device.
25       Perfect levels of pH, perfect levels of nicotine to keep people smoking and keep people
2 dying.  They love it.
3       And the hoops that the FDA would ever
4 have to jump through to even get something
5 passed.  Do you think they are just going to
6 tie their hands behind their back if the FDA
7 says, We want you to eliminate this additive or
8 we want you to reduce this amount of nicotine?
9       Do you think they're going to stand by
10 this company, R.J. Reynolds, or are they going
11 to take every single step necessary --
12       MR. KACZYNSKI:  Objection, Your Honor.
13       THE COURT:  Sustained.
14       Counsel, you need to wrap it up.
15       MR. ROSEN:  Thank you, Your Honor.
16       Look at what they do and not what they
17 say.
18       I asked him.  I'm just asking:  You don't
19 believe nicotine is physically addictive?
20       I've stated that previously.  Yes.
21       That's what he said in this courtroom.
22 And I had to cross-examine him with his own
23 document, his own Zonnic gum insert that talks
24 about how nicotine is basically addictive.
25       Each of those products is a nicotine delivery device.  No, they are tobacco that
2 just contains nicotine.  They are designed to
3 deliver nicotine to the consumer.  No.
4       What else is Vuse?  It's nicotine -- it's
5 designed to deliver nicotine.
6       We're trying to migrate people.  We're
7 trying to grow our cigarette market.
8       That's what they're doing.  They're not
9 migrating anybody.
10       Cigarettes cause lung cancer.  Snus cause
11 mouth cancer.  They're selling them both.
12       I'm not going to play that.  You all saw
13 the video.
14       I appreciate your time.  Truly,
15 everything, your patience with us.  And we ask
16 you to render a verdict, a fair amount of
17 punitive damages, so this company listens.
18       Thank you.
