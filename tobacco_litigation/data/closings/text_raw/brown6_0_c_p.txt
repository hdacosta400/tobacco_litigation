 1
are the judges of the facts and no one but you are the
 2
judges of the facts.  
 3
And I and Ms. Brown and Mr. Ledlie and everyone
 4
who has been here thank you for that.  We thank you for your
 5
service, we thank you for your attentiveness.  We thank you
 6
for how closely you've studied the evidence in this case and
 7
we thank you for giving Ms. Brown an opportunity to be on
 8
equal footing with the Philip Morris corporation.
 9
So what I'm going to do over the next 45 minutes
or so, maybe a little longer, is lay out for you the
evidence as I have seen it and what we have to prove.  And
Judge Savage has created a form that has some very specific
questions that you have to answer.  It's called a verdict
form.  And he will give you some instructions this afternoon
about the law and what the law is comes from him.  What the
facts are come from you.
Now, I am going to go over a lot of evidence and
go over it in some detail.  And you may think, Mr. Finch,
it's getting close to lunch, I've heard this before, stop, I
got it, don't need to hear any more.  But we can't do that.
I have a burden to represent Ms. Brown to the absolute best
of my ability and to make sure each and every one of you
understands all the evidence on her side of the case and how
little evidence there is on Philip Morris's side of the
case. There are basically three questions you have to
 2
answer.  And I'm not gonna try to work off of that, that was
  1602
 3
what I drew up last night.  
 4
But the question boils down to:  Was Donna Brown
 5
addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine.  That's the
 6
first question you're going to get.
 7
The second:  Was Donna Brown's addiction to
 8
cigarettes containing nicotine a legal cause of her PVD?
 9
And a third question is:  Was smoking Philip
Morris's cigarettes a legal cause of her PVD?
And on each of those questions and, indeed, on
almost every question in the case, plaintiff has the burden
by a preponderance of the evidence.  And what that means,
you're going to hear an instruction from the Judge, is you
have scales, remember the Lady Justice has scales, starts
out even Steven.  Ms. Brown is here and Philip Morris is
here.  Where else but in a courtroom can people start out
even Steven with corporation.  Even Steven.
So there they are.  And Ms. Brown has brought you
a ton of evidence on each of those questions, on addiction,
on addiction causing her repeated smoking, which caused her
PVD, and that smoking Philip Morris caused -- cigarettes
caused her PVD.  I think that the evidence is overwhelming
on that and I'm going to take you through it in some detail.  
If you answer those first three questions yes, 1603
 1
then certain factual findings apply.  The Judge is going to
 2
read what those findings are.  And you have to accept them
 3
as true.  No matter what you think, whether you disagree
 4
with them or agree with them, you swore an oath at the
 5
outset of this case to apply the law to the facts and you
 6
have to accept what the Judge says as the law as true.
 7
 8
 9
Those factual findings are:
That nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; 
That smoking cigarettes can cause peripheral
vascular disease; 
That Philip Morris placed cigarettes on the market
that were defective and unreasonably dangerous; 
That Philip Morris was negligent, careless; 
That Philip Morris omitted, knowingly concealed or
omitted, material information, information that a person
would want to know, information about how addictive their
products were, information about what kind of risk are you
really running when you pick up your first cigarette at the
age of 16 when all the label says is caution, may be
hazardous to your health.  May be, may not be.  Getting in a
car may be hazardous to your health, but would you get in a
car if you knew that you had a two-thirds chance of getting
addicted and if you kept on driving, a 50 percent chance you
would die?  That's a material fact that was not disclosed.
And then, finally, that Philip Morris was engaged 1604
 1
in a conspiracy with other defendants to conceal or omit
 2
material information.  You have to accept that as true, if
 3
you find that she was addicted to nicotine, smoking
 4
cigarettes, that the addiction was a legal cause of her PVD
 5
and that smoking cigarettes made by Philip Morris was a
 6
cause of her PVD.
 7
So on question one, addiction, what is the
 8
evidence that you heard on that?  Well, you heard Donna
 9
Brown's testimony.  You heard Annelisa Smith's testimony
about Donna told you when she started, how she started, how
long she smoked, how many times she tried to quit, how
desperately she tried to quit.  She tried to quit again and
again and again using every device known to modern man.
Annelisa Smith talked about that talked about how Donna was
serious about trying to quit.
The medical records in this case.  We put in some
medical records, they put in some medical records.  I want
you to look at all the medical records.  But we're the only
people that brought you three medical doctors to explain to
you what those medical records mean.  Not just the ones that
we submitted to the jury, but all the medical records.
And then other things you should consider on the
question of addiction is Dr. Werner's testimony,
Dr. Harding's testimony, and the Surgeon General of the
United States.  We stand with the Surgeon General on all 1605
 1
points as it relates to smoking and disease.  Philip Morris
 2
when it's not in a courtroom, points people to the Surgeon
 3
General's reports as reliable and authoritative for people
 4
to look at if they have to make decisions about smoking
 5
addiction and health.
 6
Well, you are people that are going to have to
 7
make a decision about smoking addiction and health very soon
 8
and one's life is in the balance.
 9
You should rely on the Surgeon General.  Not what
Philip Morris might say elsewhere.  Rely on the Surgeon
General.  Philip Morris has a long history of disagreeing
with the Surgeon General.  In a courtroom, we stand with the
Surgeon General, we stand with the Surgeon General outside
of it.
So what does addiction mean?  The only medical
doctor that testified in this trial who was an addiction
specialist was Dr. Werner and she said that addiction, as
defined by the National Institute on Drug Abuse is chronic
relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug
seeking and use despite harmful consequences.  That fits
Donna to a T.
This is a pack of cigarettes.  This is a pack and
a half of cigarettes, which is about what Donna smoked for
most of her smoking life.  Think about smoking all of that
every day.  This is 120 packs of cigarettes.  Three of these 1606
 1
is 360 packs of cigarettes.  That's 360 pack years, 360,
 2
which is one pack year.
 3
Remember, she smoked for over 40 years.  If we
 4
were to make boards for all the packs of cigarettes she
 5
smoked, it would cover the entire courtroom.  She smoked
 6
heavily because she wanted the drugs.  That definition is a
 7
definition that the medical doctor who testified in this
 8
case used.  And while there was a suggestion to you, well,
 9
there are different ways to define addiction or different
ways to assess addiction, Dr. Werner, the lady from Florida,
who has treated people for addiction in all kind of
contexts, drug addiction, nicotine addiction, was quite
clear and says whether or not addiction -- whether or not
someone is addicted is a medical question and she provided
and the doctors who treated Donna Brown provided the only
medical doctors who gave you evidence or gave you
information that she was addicted.
How powerful is addiction.  In 1988, the first
time the Surgeon General said that nicotine was addicting,
despite the fact that the tobacco companies in their
internal secret documents were saying that nicotine was
addicting back in the '50s and early '60s, that led to that
big mutton chop guy, C. Everett Koop, coming out and saying,
hey, cigarettes are really addicting, we have to treat this
as a serious medical problem.  And think about all of the 1607
 1
medical devices available to treat nicotine addiction that
 2
have become available since then.
 3
What do they say?  Cigarettes are addicting,
 4
nicotine is a drug, and processes that determine tobacco
 5
addiction are similar to heroin and cocaine.  That is a
 6
powerful addiction.
 7
So what else does the Surgeon General report 1988,
 8
and this was in the exhibit that you will get to see.  It's
 9
Exhibit 174.  They say that recognizing tobacco use as an
addiction is critical to understand in knowing how to treat
it.  Then, that's a watershed event in this country.  People
for the first time really started to wake up as to the power
of addiction.  Before that, well, smoking is a habit, I can
quit, choice, free choice, free country, why, you know,
what's the big deal?
So what else do we know about from the Surgeon
General of the United States about addiction?  What do we
know about what the power of addiction is on young people?
Do you remember yesterday we put into evidence -- this is
the 2012 Surgeon General's report.  And what that says is of
every three young smokers, only one will quit and of one of
those remaining smokers will die from tobacco-related
causes.  Most younger people never consider that when they
start.  Think about that.  You're a young person and you
start smoking, a kid like Donna was, 16 years old, started 1608
 1
smoking cigarettes, you got a two-third chance of getting
 2
hooked for life and, if you get hooked for life, a 50/50
 3
chance of dying of a smoke-related disease.  Is that
 4
material information?  Is that information that if you're
 5
going to pick up that first cigarette you would really like
 6
to know?
 7
So what was Annelisa Smith's testimony about
 8
Donna?  She talked about how her brand was -- she knew it
 9
was Marlboro Lights, she smoked a lot, pack and a half a
day, first thing when she got up, smoked when she went to
bed, she was smoking Marlboro consistently, and she would
smoke when she got up in the night.
She testified that she went with Donna to her very
first visit with Dr. Harding and Dr. Harding told Donna,
your problems are caused by smoking and you got to quit.
And Donna tried to quit.  She testified -- Donna
testified she tried to cut back before that.  But now she
tried every medical device available to man to try to quit,
Chantix, Wellbutrin, Zyban, she tried this shot behind the
ear, she tried all kinds of things to quit.  And Annelisa
told us that Donna was motivated to quit, and every time she
tried to quit it was real.  Finally Donna quit in 2014.
What did you learn from Donna herself, both last
week and when they read some of her prior testimony today?
Well, Donna is an amazing person.  She's the type of person 1609
 1
that this country wants our children to grow up to be.  She
 2
is a successful person.  She was all-American in softball,
 3
she ran track in high school, she was the first cable --
 4
female cable splicer at her job, she was successful in her
 5
job.  She continued on to keep on working.  And what was her
 6
fatal flaw?  What was her one fatal flaw?  She was addicted,
 7
addicted to nicotine.  That's the thing.  That's the only
 8
thing that makes sense, this proud strong-willed woman, who
 9
has fought her injuries for years.  She's a fighter.
Addiction, addiction is the only reason that makes sense.
Remember, not only did Donna talk about having
that first cigarette as a teenager when she was 16 years old
and how she smoked because Marlboro was the cool thing,
Marlboro was the it brand.  That's what everybody was
smoking.  She talked about how she tried to quit and she
talked about how she tried everything to quit.  And you
heard testimony from her sister, remember they put someone
else in the box to play Ms. Brown's sister.  There was
testimony that during the '80s and '90s, before she ever got
PVD, she was trying to cut back, trying to quit.  So we have
that is the background.  Those are the ways she tried to
quit.
Who, what medical doctor, came here and told you
she was addicted?  Dr. Werner.  Qualifications are enormous.
She diagnoses and treats addicts for a living.  She testifies in both civil and criminal cases about addiction.
  1610
 2
She used three different ways to diagnose Donna as being
 3
addicted.  She was very clear that addiction is a medical
 4
brain disease and that if you're going to decide whether
 5
someone has a medical disease, you rely on a doctor.  You
 6
use three different ways to addiction, CAGE questionnaire
 7
Fagerstrom test, DSM-V.  Under all three of them, she was
 8
severely addicted, high under Fagerstrom, DSM-V she was
 9
severe.
The medical records in this case prove addiction.
That one from relatively recent, 2005, heavy tobacco use, up
to two cartons a week, that's 6005-V, as in Virginia,
6005-B, as in basketball.  They actually have tobacco use
disorder diagnose code.  So I think there's no doubt that
Donna was addicted to nicotine from smoking cigarettes.  So
when filling out the verdict form, check that question, yes.
Remember, Dr. Werner said there is a consensus in
the medical field that addiction is a disease.  What doctor
did Philip Morris bring to rebut that?  The only evidence on
that side of the case, the only medical evidence, is from
Dr. Werner and Donna Brown's doctors.  For Philip Morris to
be right on this question of addiction or in order for you
to say no, all this has to be wrong, deny definition of drug
abuse, Surgeon General, Donna Brown's doctors who prescribed
the patch, Donna Brown's doctors who prescribed Chantix, 1611
 1
whoever the doctor was at St. Vincent's that diagnosed her
 2
with -- gave her tobacco use disorder.
 3
Remember, before a doctor is going to do a
 4
treatment to a person, Dr. Harding explained, you have to
 5
first do no harm.  You're not going to give a drug to
 6
somebody else, they need it.  You're not going to give them
 7
a drug that is designed to treat addiction like Chantix
 8
unless they need it.  She was addicted.
 9
So next question.  Addiction as a cause of PVD.
Again, evidence you should look to on that is Dr. Werner's
testimony, Dr. Harding's testimony, Dr. Jackson's testimony,
the medical records in evidence, all of them, but
particularly 6005-A, as in apple, and B, as in basketball.
And the 2010 Surgeon General's report.  That's the one that
says nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason people
persist in smoking cigarettes and it's this persistent
smoking that causes the smoking-related diseases.
That's the one that Mr. Jupe fenced around with my
colleague when he was asked questions in the deposition.  I
don't understand chain in causation.  Well, the Surgeon
General understand the chain of causation, the doctors
understand the chain of causation.
Now, you're going to hear the definition of legal
cause from the Judge.  And what I say the law is is not the
law.  And what she says the law is is not the law.  The 1612
 1
Judge fives you the law.
 2
But it's a legal cause, not the only legal cause.
 3
There can be multiple legal causes of the same injury or
 4
event.  If for something -- you'll hear words but for and
 5
necessary.  If you recall, my questions to all the doctors
 6
were along the lines but for her nicotine addiction would
 7
she have persisted in smoking 40 years?  And Dr. Werner
 8
said, she answered yes to that question.  Now, the question
 9
is not the evidence, but if you answer yes to the question,
that is the evidence.
So if you think about it as a flashlight,
substantial contribution or being necessary, you have a
flashlight that has four batteries or three batteries in it
and this applies to both addiction, it applies to both
addiction and cigarette smoking causing her PVD.  Even if
you believe addiction is only one of the three batteries,
and I think for Donna Brown addiction was the primary reason
she smoked just like everybody else that is addicted.  Not
everybody smokes gets addicted, that's clear.  But for the
people who do, nicotine is a fundamental -- nicotine
addiction is a fundamental reason that drives them.
So without that addiction, she smokes far less.
She doesn't -- you know, she could quit if she's not
addicted.  And the ability to quit or attempts to quit, just
because someone is able to quit or just because someone has 1613
 1
the ability to quit doesn't mean they're not addicted.
 2
Heroin addicts quit.  You heard that from Dr. Werner.  So
 3
addiction is the dominant cause of her repeated smoking.
 4
And addiction, remember it's connect the dots,
 5
Dr. Werner said that but for her addiction she wouldn't have
 6
engaged in repeated persistent smoking for 40 years.
 7
Dr. Harding and Dr. -- and Dr. Jackson both said that it was
 8
the repeated persistent smoking which was the main, primary,
 9
dominant substantial cause of her PVD.  And I'll get to
exactly what they said in a few minutes.  But this is what
the 2010 Surgeon General's report says:  Nicotine addiction
is the fundamental reason that people persist in smoking.
And it is the fundamental reason that Donna continued to
persist in smoking.
What did Dr. Werner tell you?  That nicotine
addiction was the fundamental reason Donna Brown repeatedly
smoked cigarettes for 40 years and but for her nicotine
addiction, Donna Brown would not have engaged in heavy
smoking for as long as she did.  That is but for causation,
substantial factor causation, however you want to phrase it,
that is a legal cause.
And what did Dr. Harding say?  Dr. Harding treated
her for 20 years.  The man with no dog in the fight, he came
here to testify, because he's a treating doctor and probably
knows more about her than anyone.  And remember what Annelisa and Donna said about what he told them at the time.
 2
He said, Donna, your smoking caused your disease and you got
 3
to stop smoking.  Did he get on her about diabetes?  No.
  1614
 4
She didn't have diabetes.  Did he get on her about
 5
hyperlipidemia?  No.  At that time she didn't have
 6
hyperlipidemia.  Did they get on her about high blood
 7
pressure?  No.  It was smoking.  And what did he say?
 8
Remember what he said when I asked him, I asked the
 9
questions -- I asked him, was smoking medically significant
to you?  Yes.  I asked him, did Donna's smoking cause or
contribute substantially to her PVD?  And his answer was, it
certainly contributed, yes.  Then I asked him, but for her
smoking, would her PVD be different, a different disease in
terms of severity, progression, when she got it?  And he
said, yes.  I said, what do you mean by that?  And then he
used the analogy -- remember the risk factors, he used the
analogy of kerosene on a fire.  
And this is the chart from 1998 that he filled
out, the risk factors, diabetes, hypertension, tobacco
severe, hyperlipidemia, unknown.  That's peripheral vascular
disease.  And that -- and his testimony, I just told you
that Donna smoking was like throwing kerosene on a fire.
You throw kerosene on a fire and the fire rages out of
control, is that a substantial factor?  Isn't throwing
kerosene on a little match fire necessary to blow it out of 1615
 1
control?  It's huge.
 2
So not only do we bring Dr. Harding, who was her
 3
treating doctor, knew her for 20 years, and also told you
 4
that in his view Donna was interested in trying to quit and
 5
was seriously trying to quit and was trying to take his
 6
advise.  Well, why didn't she successfully quit until 2014?
 7
She was addicted.
 8
Dr. Jackson, published many articles on causation
 9
of cardiovascular disease.  She came in and talked to you a
little bit about epidemiology and about risk factors and
about the mechanism, how smoking causes peripheral vascular
disease.  And she agreed with Dr. Harding that smoking
cigarettes was a substantial factor in causing Donna's PVD.
And she -- these are the risk factors.  She -- for Donna,
smoking was definitely there, she was definitely not
diabetic.  These other ones, hypochondria, hyperglycinemia,
reactive protein, they're much lower.  Potential risk
factors.  It defies reality, you have to shut your eyes to
reality to say that smoking wasn't the dominant cause.  It's
like if there were elephants standing in this room that were
cigarettes, you have to say, no, no, no, don't look at the
elephant.  
Look at the high blood pressure readings that she
had after she was diagnosed with PVD.  Look at the
hyperlipidemia readings that she had after she was diagnosed 1616
 1
with PVD.
 2
Dr. Jackson looked all her medical records.  And
 3
remember, she was trying to figure out what caused her PVD.
 4
The lady got PVD in 1992.  And Dr. Jackson's testimony was
 5
smoking was the dominant factor in the cause of her PVD, it
 6
was necessary to the severity of her PVD.
 7
Now, do you remember yesterday the defendants
 8
showed you a lot of medical records from Donna Brown that
 9
had notations about hypertension, hyperlipidemia.  Do you
remember how I asked them to publish the date on every one
of those records?  All those records, 2002, that was
Defendant's Exhibit 726-D, ten years after she got PVD.
2002, 2003.  December 1998, this is the one I want to talk
about, it's the only one of theirs that I want to talk
about.  That's even close in time, six years after she got
PVD.  2006, 2005, 2006, 2006, 2010, 2014, you can look at
them yourselves, none of them were anywhere close in time to
when she was diagnosed with PVD except for this one which,
is 734-A.  And about past medical history, it says
contributory for heart disease, low blood sugar, rheumatic
fever.  But there's nothing about hyperlipidemia, there's
nothing about family history.  They have a family history of
atherosclerosis, but there's nothing about her history.  
And, remember, at -- at the end of the day, we
brought you two medical doctors that said -- that repeated 1617
 1
persistent smoking was the dominant factor, substantial
 2
factor, a real factor, kerosene on a fire.  You think they
 3
both just got it wrong?  For something to cause something
 4
else, whether it's diseases or physics, it's got to happen
 5
before.  In order for hyperlipidemia or hypertension to be a
 6
role, have a role in causing disease, it has to be present
 7
before you get the disease.  She got the disease in '92.
 8
Only thing she was doing before '92, only health risks she
 9
said at that point that were persistent by that point,
30-year pack history of smoking.
There is a jury instruction that says when you're
evaluating evidence, use your common sense.  You don't check
your common sense at the door when you walk in here and say,
oh, for a lady who smoked 45-year pack history of smoking
and then after she gets disease she starts to have other
health problems, did those other factors cause her disease?
No, you can't say that.
And then I asked Dr. Jackson, there was no -- no
medical doctor came in here and said that smoking wasn't the
cause of Donna's PVD.  No medical doctor came in here and
disputed this, that nicotine addiction is a fundamental
reason that she kept smoking and that persistent smoking
caused her PVD.  What doctor disputed that causal link?  Was
she able to quit smoking?  That's not the question.  Did she
choose to smoke?  That's not the question.  Was the smoking 1618
 1
pleasurable?  Of course it was, it's a drug.  Was she able
 2
to control her smoking?  That's not the question either.
 3
The question is was she addicted.  All the medical evidence
 4
says she was.  And was she so addicted if she had quit in
 5
'92 her disease would not have progressed?  That's not the
 6
question either.  She got disease and smoking was the
 7
dominant factor.  All the medical doctors told you so.  So
 8
on jury Question 2, and jury Question 3, was her addiction
 9
to cigarettes containing nicotine a legal cause of her
vascular disease, the answer is yes.
Was her smoking cigarettes containing nicotine
manufactured by Philip Morris a legal cause of her
peripheral vascular disease.  Well, her testimony was
Marlboro was her brand.  Occasionally, she got Winstons, but
it was all Marlboro.  So clearly the answer to that question
is yes.  So one, two, and three are yes.  
And lest you have any doubt about that, that's a
repeat of Dr. Harding's testimony, and those are what the
risk factors Dr. Harding was looking at. 
Dr. Jackson, Dr. Jackson was looking at -- she was
trying to figure out the cause.  Remember, at the very end
of her exam I asked her, even if Donna Brown was somehow
predisposed, because of family history or anything else, to
develop PVD, was her long-term smoking history substantially
contributed to causing that?  Answer, absolutely yes.  In the real world and in this courtroom, to ignore the smoking
 2
as a substantial, dominant, but for cause of her getting
 3
disease when she got it and the severity that it had,
 4
there's just -- we have overwhelmingly proved the case on
  1619
 5
that.
 6
So if you answer the first three questions yes,
 7
which I suggest to you that beyond a reasonable doubt the
 8
evidence is yes, the first three questions, the factual
 9
findings apply, and those are the factual findings that
Philip Morris was addictive -- that nicotine is addictive,
Philip Morris was negligent, you have to apply those
findings once you find the addiction led to -- the smoking
led to the PVD.
Someone may say, well, I don't know if I agree
with those findings.  If they do that, your duty as a jury
is to say, hey, wait a minute, the Judge told us what the
law is and we swore to follow the law.  This is law of this
case you must find applies.
So then you get to this question, Question 4,
percentage of fault.  And here, when you're comparing fault,
I want you to think about who knew what, when, and what did
they did with that knowledge.  Move this a little closer so
you can all see it.
Philip Morris knew in the '50s that smoking caused
cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, yet it chose to tell 1620
 1
its customers for 40 years after that, cigarettes hadn't
 2
been proven to cause disease.  They knew that and they kept
 3
telling their customers that and they kept choosing to sell
 4
a dangerous and defective product.  It's a dangerous and
 5
defective product.  That's what that finding is.  If they
 6
kept -- they kept choosing to sell it year after year after
 7
year.  Every cigarette Donna smoked was made by them was
 8
defective and unreasonably dangerous.  Every cigarette Donna
 9
smoked was defective and unreasonably dangerous and kept
getting her more and more addicted and was more and more
contributing and causing her PVD.  Did they try to degree
call their cigarettes off the market in the '50s or '60s?
No.
They knew by the late '50s there's no way to
remove all the harmful chemicals from the smoke.  Mr. Jupe,
who wasn't born until the year I was, 1967, came in here and
tried to say, well, we were trying to remove chemicals, but
I want to look at some of the documents in evidence.  Look
at Exhibit 166 and I'll show you at the very end of this.
But basically they knew by 1961 there was no way getting
harmful chemicals out of the smoke, yet they kept on.  And
that nicotine caused cardiovascular disease.  There's no way
to fix it.
So instead of, you know, putting people's health
paramount, as they promised in their big newspaper ad in 1621
 1
1953, 1954, they kept selling cigarettes.  They knew by 1959
 2
or earlier, probably 1954, that nicotine was addictive and
 3
it was addiction that was driving people to smoke, yet they
 4
kept telling their customers up until 1999, you're not
 5
addicted.  Don't worry.  It's a choice. 
 6
Imagine if Budweiser were to go into an Alcoholic
 7
Anonymous meeting and come in and say, oh, you guys aren't
 8
addicted to alcohol, don't worry, it's just a choice, it's
 9
not an addiction.  Think about that.
What else did they do?  They chose to set the
nicotine level at a level designed to create and ensure
addiction in the products.
What else did they do?  They marketed Marlboros to
minors.  They knew you hook them young, you got them hooked
for life.  And you heard the testimony of Dr. Kyriakoudes,
but you also saw their documents that talked about how they
were focusing on teenagers.  And Joseph Cullman, remember
that video that Dr. Kyriakoudes showed talked about how
advertising made Marlboro -- made it the cool, the
cigarette.
Repeatedly for 40 years, Philip Morris and other
cigarette companies told their customers to believe that
cigarettes were not harmful and were not addictive.  And
remember, they also tried to interfere with Dow's efforts in
1984 to develop Nicorette gum?  That is bad conduct. 1622
 1
So that is Philip Morris's fault.  All of those
 2
things I said.  The scales of justice, whom you're weighing
 3
fault, you put far more of it on then than on Donna.  
 4
What can you really fault Donna for?  Can you
 5
fault her for trying Marlboros by age 16?  We all met
 6
children, 16 years olds, we don't let them join the Army.
 7
They're not allowed to make informed decisions about taking
 8
prescription drugs or have surgery for a reason.  You can't
 9
make a reasonable rational choice as well at 16 as you can
when you're 25 or 30 or 40.
So how much fault can you really put on her for
that?  A little bit, one or two percent?  Remember, when she
picked up that first pack of cigarettes, said caution
smoking cigarettes may be hazardous to your health.  May be,
what teenager is going to pay attention to that?  May be
hazardous, may not be.  The tobacco industry used that to a
great effect in its advertising and its public statements.
To have a real appreciation of the risks, you have
to know all the information.  And Donna testified she
certainly didn't know as much about the health risks of
smoking when she picked up that first cigarette that she
does 40 years later.  And nobody did, because I mean, think
about the difference between somebody saying, well, the
government is just saying that, you don't have to worry
about it, and defendant saying, well, yeah, my product is 1623
 1
pretty bad, it's killing people.  Defendant comes in and
 2
says, my product is bad, it's killing people, you're going
 3
to believe it, because they made the product.  Otherwise,
 4
the government is the government.  You can listen to the
 5
government, you can ignore the government.  A lot of people,
 6
government says there's global warming, I don't necessarily
 7
buy that.  Some people do, some people don't.  The
 8
government says this, the government says that.  But if a
 9
person who made the product come out and says, yeah, my
product will kill you and it's two-thirds chance if you
smoke it as a teenager you're going to get addicted, that
changes your view about that.  So becoming addicted to
cigarettes containing nicotine, can you really fault Donna
for that?
That's exactly what they want America to do.
Every cigarette they sold had nicotine in it.  The whole
goal was to get people hooked so they would buy more
cigarettes.  Can you really put any fault on her for
becoming addicted?  When two-thirds of teenagers who start
to smoke become addicted?  How can that be a fault?  How can
you assign legal fault and blame for that?  Not breaking her
addiction until 2014.
People, classic definition of addiction is to
continue smoking despite knowledge of harmful consequences.
Donna knew when she first started smoking Marlboros, yeah, 1624
 1
there were some potential harm there.  She didn't have a
 2
full and sane appreciation for the real risk she was
 3
running.  So, yeah, maybe you should tag her for some fault
 4
for that.  But you know what?  She got addicted real fast.
 5
And once -- and she tried everything to break her habit.
 6
And she eventually did.  Years too late for her, but she
 7
did.  Is it fair to fault her for not being able to break
 8
her addiction earlier than that when their whole goal was to
 9
addict her, keep her addicted, reassure the public health
community, dispute the public health community messages?  
And the Surgeon General of the United States
didn't call nicotine an addiction until 1988.  What --
imagine a world where if Philip Morris had sent the 1959
memo I showed you yesterday that says nicotine is
addictive -- I think that's Exhibit 100, I'll show it in a
minute.  What if had they sent that the Surgeon General,
saying -- in addition to saying smoking causes lung cancer,
maybe you should say smoking is addictive.  What do you
think would happen then?  Would Donna have -- the world
would change.  It changed a lot in 1988, didn't it?  Lots of
product came out no 1988.
So as between Philip Morris and Donna Brown, I'll
let you make that call, but I suggest to you that if you're
going to put fault on her, it ought to be in the single
digits.  They did, they were reckless, they were careless, 1625
 1
they did wrong, they do things that people have known since
 2
the Bible not to do wrong.  Don't throw a stumbling block in
 3
front of a blind man.  Do not mislead youngsters into trying
 4
deadly and dangerous products.  That's wrong, that's really
 5
wrong, morally wrong, it is a big, big wrong.  Put more of
 6
the fault on them.  Put some on her, sure.  But I suggest to
 7
you it shouldn't be very much.
 8
So this question I'm gonna leave blank, but it
 9
ought to be heavily weighted on them and very little on her.
Now, once you answer this question, then you
get -- there's some other questions on here about the
intentional, did the defendant, did -- is Philip Morris
liable to Donna, her claim is defendant, Philip Morris,
concealed or omitted material information about the health
effects or the effect of the nature of smoking cigarettes.
Well, the finding you have to apply say that they clearly
did that.  And so the question is:  Did she rely to her
detriment in some way on that?  And it's a funny thing, how
do you rely on something that's not said?  What was omitted,
what was important?  What would have been really nice to
know, if you pick up this cigarette, you have a two-thirds
chance to get addicted and you've got a 50 percent chance of
dying.  And you know the old saying a picture is worth a
thousand words?  In 1966 Philip Morris could have put the
big skull and cross bone on that pack if it wanted to.  Did 1626
 1
it?  Might have affected sales, wouldn't it?
 2
So as to the intentional -- what they call
 3
intentional course, I suggest to you the answer is yes.
 4
There's a question about were statements made before and
 5
after 1982.  Remember that Philip Morris disputed the 1988
 6
Surgeon General's claim that cigarettes were addictive in
 7
1984.  They made statements to Dow saying, you guys, we
 8
don't like it that you're calling our product addictive,
 9
stop messing around, stop trying to sell Nicorette gum.  So
I think the answer is both before and after 1982.
Question 7 is a similar type of thing, yes, before
and after.
But even if you -- let's say you get into a debate
about, well, what is fraud, maybe this doesn't -- make some
of these statements maybe she didn't rely on anything after
1982.  I think clearly did, it was clearly important to her
when the Surgeon General said nicotine was addictive.
That's the only thing she remembered.  And remember, it's
the omission of information.  The omission of material
information, information people had a right to know and
should have known.
Everybody in America was exposed to cigarette
advertising in the '50s and '60s.  So I think the answer is
well beyond preponderance of the evidence that they did
engage in intentional misconduct that did cause her 1627
 1
detriment.
 2
And even if you disagree with me, as to the first
 3
four questions, was she addicted, did addiction cause her
 4
repeated smoking, did smoking cause her disease, that's a
 5
slam dunk.  That's between their fault and her fault.  It
 6
ought to be much more on them and much less on her.
 7
So I'm not gonna go through all the evidence
 8
you've scene in this case.  It's right there.  Well, it was
 9
right there.  The exhibits were on the table there, you'll
get to look at the exhibits if you need to.  There was
documents showing that advertising mattered.  That's
Exhibit 580.  I showed you some ads that were common in the
'40s and '50s.  It was a cigarette culture.  Dr. Kyriakoudes
talked about that.  Joseph Cullman, Marlboro, Marlboro man
advertising, the FTC report, cigarettes were pervasive, and
major conclusion from the Surgeon General's report in 2012,
where we stand with the Surgeon General on all issues, is
that advertising and promotional activities by tobacco
companies have been shown to cause the onset and
continuation of smoking among adolescents and young adults.
And if you don't believe the Surgeon General, which you
should, because Philip Morris said you should, absolutely
the case.  
Look at their internal documents, look at
Exhibit 527.  I'm not gonna take the time to read it.  When 1628
 1
you get to it, read it.  They're short documents.  They're
 2
short documents because back then somebody typed them up,
 3
they couldn't just edit them repeatedly on a computer the
 4
way we can today.  Somebody typed them up, a senior
 5
executive signed them.  They were focusing on young smokers.
 6
Read Exhibit 527 where they say, the Surgeon General
 7
estimates that 4500 youngsters begin smoking every day.  If
 8
this is true, it means that 45, 50 percent of potential new
 9
smokers are smoking and does not imply a significant
reduction.  
Then there's a look back document, Exhibit 846,
where they say, it's important to know as much as possible
about teenage smoking and attitudes of today's teenagers,
tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming
majority of smokers first being smokers while still in their
teens.  They talk about how Marlboro became the brand of
choice among teenagers in the '60s.  That's why Marlboro is
so big today, there were people hooked who still are smoking
Marlboro.  If you need demographic evidence, Exhibit 1755
shows you that effect.
I told you in evaluating fault, you got to go back
to 1953, think about who knew what when.  The Plaza Hotel
meeting, they knew that smoking was a habit, can't break it,
cigarettes cause cancer.  By 1959, Philip Morris knew that
people smoked because of addiction.  By 1959, one of the 1629
 1
main reasons people smoke is to experience addiction,
 2
September -- that's a document never given to the Surgeon
 3
General.  They had the document, Exhibit 165, a cigarette is
 4
not the problem, it's the package, the product of nicotine.
 5
And that all these documents show they knew exactly how to
 6
set the level of nicotine.  
 7
Even Mr. Jupe admitted they can put their nicotine
 8
at whatever level they want.  What did they choose to do
 9
with that knowledge besides lying to Congress?  Besides
interfering -- this is Exhibit 34, that's when they
interfere with Dow's Nicorette gum.  They kept selling a
defective, deadly, and dangerous product and denying it was
addictive.  As the Tobacco Institute's own documents say,
Exhibit 94, you can't defend continued smoking as free
choice if the person was addicted.
Go back to 1953.  Again, they promised they're
going to put public health paramount over every
consideration in their business.  Judge them by their own
promises.  What did they do the next 45 years?  This is a
document, Exhibit 1754, in evidence, that's the one where
Philip Morris was sending -- having a doctor go out and
collect world literature, indicated again that
cardiovascular problems would probably turn out to be the
more serious problem.  Read that whole letter, two-page
letter.  If nothing else proves knowledge, that does. 1630
 1
Exhibit 166, again, that's a document where they
 2
talk about can't get cigarette smoke out of the cigarettes
 3
and can't get harmful constituents out of the cigarette
 4
smoke, and that nicotine causes -- nicotine causes
 5
cardiovascular disease.
 6
What was the response of the tobacco companies to
 7
the Surgeon General and public health's messages?  Overwhelm
 8
them with advertising.  And it worked.  This is
 9
Exhibit 1755.  If you want to take a ruler and draw some
lines, smoking rate in this country in 1980 was about where
it was in 1960 despite the Surgeon General warnings, despite
all the public advocacy ads, despite everything that was out
there.  What happens in 1999?  It starts going down, really
down.  Starts going down before that, but in 1988 the first
drugs are starting to become available in the '80s to treat
nicotine addiction.
So what is Philip Morris gonna say?  They're
probably going to say she's not addicted, they'll probably
say that the hyper -- hyperlipidemia was a cause or the
cause or she had a family history that caused her PVD.  She
didn't get hyperlipidemia or hypertension until after she
already had PVD and most of those records were after she had
her legs amputated.  And there's no doctor who's going to
come in here, who came in here, who told you that she wasn't
addicted.  We have burden of proof on that, we accept that 1631
 1
burden, we proved it overwhelmingly.
 2
They're going to say that their conduct had
 3
nothing to do with her PVD, but think about this:  Outside
 4
of the courtroom, if somebody said, hey, you gonna be asked
 5
a question whether smoking cigarettes caused this woman's
 6
PVD, we know it caused PVD, she smoked 45 pack years of it,
 7
tried everything under the Sunday to quit, couldn't quit.
 8
What would you say to that?  That sounds crazy.  You
 9
shouldn't give their arguments any more weight in the
courtroom than you would outside the courtroom.  
And as to the argument that their conduct had no
impact on her life, they created an environment where
cigarette smoking was cool.  They omitted material and
important information from their cigarette packages and from
their advertising.  They did everything's they could to get
young people hooked on cigarettes and people on smoking.
The scales of justice, justice weighs heavily,
heavily on my shoulders, and soon it's going to be on your
shoulders.  It's going to be your job to write the last
chapter of Donna Brown's life.
This I think is the hardest question on the form.
It's the damages.  Because you do get to the damages
questions if you answer one, two, three yes, and if you find
that Philip Morris is at fault.  You got to measure the full
and fair measure of damages.  And as to that I can only give 1632
 1
you some guidance.
 2
What do we know from the evidence?  The jury
 3
verdict form looks a little bit different than the slide,
 4
because Judge Savage, in his wisdom, separated out the
 5
different categories so that it's clear what you're finding
 6
as damages and what you're not.  
 7
As to past medical expenses, this is medical
 8
expenses that have been paid to treat Donna's PVD.  That
 9
number is not in dispute, $439,728.  That's not in dispute.
I'm going to go on to skip the bodily injury, pain
and suffering figure for a second, which I regard as by far
the most important and hardest question for you to answer.
But remember Dr. Raffa came in and did some calculations as
to her past and future loss ability to earn money.  And if
you add the two up, it comes out to $423,759.  Don't rely on
my memory, check my math, check your notes, but he broke it
out.  And earning capacity in the future he said was
$76,039.  And past was 423,000 -- excuse me, 347,720.  And
the only decision you have to make about that is did she
stop working because of her PVD?
She testified she loved her job.  You could see
how excited she was about that.  The doctor gave her a
disability rating.  Sure, she got a buyout from Bell South,
but you think more likely than not if she hadn't had PVD,
this is a woman who was All-American softball player, who 1633
 1
was active and vigorous and loved to be outdoors and loved
 2
her job.  You think she would sit on her can and not work?
 3
I mean, come on.  Really?  So I think -- I think as to the
 4
past and future earnings, that's -- you know, they may
 5
dispute that, but I suggest to you that the number is what
 6
the number is.
 7
The other two categories of damages are very
 8
difficult.  Past bodily injury and resulting pain and
 9
suffering, disability, mental anguish, inconvenience,
ability to enjoy pleasures of life, and disfigurement.
And this is why it's very hard:  You're going to
get an instruction that says sympathy can play no role in
your verdict.  Donna Brown doesn't need your sympathy she
doesn't want your sympathy.  She wants justice.  But to do a
full and fair measure of justice, you have to look at all
the harms that she experienced as a result of their bad
conduct.  And all of us, me too, we don't like to do that.
We block it out.  Whether it's people dying from diseases in
Africa or being killed in wars in the Middle East and Europe
or brutality and violence right here in Florida, yeah, we
see that stuff happen, but do we really think about the pain
and suffering that those people go through from a real
judgmental analytical way?  If you're like most people you
probably don't.  But here, your job, you swore an oath to do
that and that's what makes this very hard. 1634
 1
Dr. Harding talked about some of the 20 surgeries
 2
that he did on Donna.  He talked about how a lot of them
 3
resulted in a lot of pain.  You know, maybe for carotid
 4
artery.  What you have to do to give a full and fair measure
 5
of damages, you have to talk about each type of surgery and
 6
say, well, how much pain and suffering was associated with
 7
that one?  You know, maybe for the carotid artery surgery,
 8
maybe they say that's $100,000.  Maybe that's $50,000 worth
 9
of pain.  But for the aortic bypass surgery, where she was
curled up in a ball and almost died?  Maybe that's half a
million or million dollars of pain.
What about having legs amputated, each leg
amputated twice?  What is that?  How much pain and suffering
and disfigurement and loss of the enjoyment of life?  If
outside of this courtroom you heard all-American ballplayer
lost his legs, can't play anymore, you think, man, that's
millions of dollars potentially.  Well, Donna loved to be an
athlete.  She ran track, she was an all-American softball
player.  What her -- losing her legs meant to her might be
different to other people.  It had tremendous value for her.
She's a fighter.  She sucks it up when she's in pain.
She -- her doctor figured she was going to be dead years
ago.  She's still here.  But look at some of those medical
records, look at the pain in the medical records.
What is losing a limb worth?  A million dollars, 1635
 1
$2 million?  What is losing the essence of what makes you
 2
you?  Both Annelisa Smith and Dr. Harding talked about --
 3
and, Donna, I'm sorry to say this, but talked about how much
 4
she's been hurt by this terrible disease.  How she's lost
 5
part of her personality.  Had a stroke, had severe health
 6
problems.  She's lost part of who she is.
 7
And so for the past bodily injury and resulting
 8
pain and suffering, I'm not gonna suggest a number to you,
 9
but I do suggest the conversation ought to start somewhere
in the middle with the doctors.  We're not here for the
$400,000 in medical bills.  This woman has lost far more
than that.  You have to give a full and fair measure of
justice, you have to value her pain, you have to look at it.
And that's gonna be hard.  You have to all have different
views about that.  Some groups of people may say 20
surgeries, that's millions of dollars right there.  Others
may say, well, maybe not, let's talk about it in more
detail.  But she lost her legs, that's worth a lot of money.
Not only is it worth a lot of money to compensate her for
all the harms and loses they inflicted on her.  So I'm not
gonna suggest a number to you, because that's what you're
here for.  She's putting your judgment, you get to make that
decision.  You get to say what is her past pain and
suffering worth, her past loss disfigurement.  
And as to the future, she may be here another 1636
 1
week, another month, maybe another year.  
 2
Donna, I'm sorry to say this, but odds are you're
 3
not going to be here that much longer.  
 4
You get to write the final chapter of her life.
 5
Her doctor, Dr. Harding, knows her better than anyone, is
 6
surprised she's still here.  But she's going to be here,
 7
she's here today, and there's some future value for what
 8
she's facing down the road.  Don't -- don't ignore that.
 9
Last question:  State whether punitive damages are
warranted against defendant, Philip Morris, under the
circumstances of this case.  And the Judge is going to give
you some guidance as to what punitive damages are and how
you award them.  Basically we have to prove by clear and
convincing evidence that they engaged in outrageous and
reckless intentional conduct that hurt Donna Brown.
Did they engage in intentionally reckless
misconduct that hurt people?  You bet.  They didn't care
whether they hurt Donna Brown or not.  They didn't care who
they hurt.  They knew their products were bad, they knew
their products were dangerous and they just kept on selling
them.  They kept on selling them.  So the answer to that
question is yes.
And if you have any doubt about that -- 
John, can I have Exhibit 166, please?
This is a presentation by Dr. Wakeham of the R&D 1637
 1
committee.  
 2
And can you go, John, to the page that -- go to
 3
page 16.  Go to Bates page -- go to Bates page 16.  Blow
 4
that up.  
 5
Smoking and cardiovascular diseases.  Belief, just
 6
the top part, belief.  You can read the whole document, read
 7
it, read it ten times while you're back there.
 8
Cardiovascular ailments which may arise from smoking are due
 9
to the physiological effects of nicotine.
And then, John, if you could go on to page 20.
Remember how Mr. Jupe was saying, we tried and
tried to get carcinogens out with cigarette smoking, we
couldn't do it.  They knew in 1961 they couldn't do it.  To
achieve this objective will require major research effort,
because carcinogens are found in practically every class of
compound in smoke.  The best we could hope for is to reduce
a particularly bad class.  Present technology does not
permit selective filtration of particulate smoke.  
They couldn't do it.  They knew in 1961 they
couldn't do it.  What did they go and do after that?  This
was five years before Donna picked up her first cigarette.
What did they do?
John, Exhibit 325, clip three.
If you want to watch any of these videos -- you
can't watch a video deposition, but if you want to watch any of the videos that were played to you in court, you can ask
 2
the Clerk to make arrangements.  
 3
Exhibit 325, number three.  This is same Helmut
 4
Wakeham who wrote that memo in 1971.  This is what he has to
  1638
 5
say in 1976 on TV:
 6
 7
(Video played as follows:)
I think that if the company as a whole believed
 8
that cigarettes were harmful, we would not be in the
 9
business.  We're a very moralistic company.  I think the
management of Philip Morris is sincere in its position.  I
think there is a great deal of doubt as to whether or not
cigarettes are harmful.  If you read both sides, not only
the point of view of the people who are -- who have
missionary zeal to make the world stop smoking, but the
people who are trying to be objective with respect to this
question, you will discover there's a great deal of doubt
with regard to whether or not smoking causes all these
diseases which are alleged to be caused by smoking.
(Video concluded.)
MR. FINCH:  That's punitive damage-type conduct
and behavior.  How do you adequately punish them for the
death toll inflicted upon America that Donna Brown is swept
up in?  How do you punish a company that's worth three
billion dollars?  No way to punish a company that's worth
that.  But you can maybe send them a message by thinking about it like this:  Whatever you decide the compensatory
 2
damages are, whatever that is, whether it's five million or
 3
ten million, whatever that is, multiple that by five.  And
 4
there -- there's ample reasons to do that.  You guys can
  1639
 5
decide.
 6
The verdict you return today or tomorrow will be
 7
written down and be in the halls of justice forever.  And
 8
six months from now, you will have forgotten my name and
 9
probably know more about cigarettes than you used to, but
you'll have forgotten names of the other lawyers.  A year
from now, you may not even remember Donna Brown's name.  But
what you do here today, she will remember every day of the
rest of her life, however long that may be.
It's a privilege and honor to represent Donna
Brown and justice is in your hands.
May it please Court, that concludes the
plaintiff's closing statement.


MR. LEDLIE:  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I'll be the last lawyer to address you today and the Judge
is going to instruct you on the law.  And before I even
begin my speech, I want to remind you that what the lawyers
have said in this case and their view of the evidence, it
doesn't mean anything.  You've heard the testimony from the
witness stand, you've heard the depositions in this case,
and you will have with you the evidence that has been
admitted by the Judge in this case for your consideration.
And that is what you will consider in deciding the case of
Ms. Donna Brown.
And the evidence in this case is that this is a
case about addiction.  And to understand Donna Brown you've
got to understand -- 
John, can we pull up --
-- that Donna Brown, who started smoking when she 1685
 1
was a young high schooler in the 1960s told you she didn't
 2
intend to be a lifelong smoker.  That's not what she went
 3
into it believing and understanding.  She didn't go into it
 4
understanding that there -- how hazardous, just how
 5
dangerous smoking was.  She, like a whole generation of
 6
people growing up in that time, in a far different time than
 7
we have today, were exposed to an unprecedented unleash of
 8
information from Philip Morris about how great their
 9
products were.  And it did have an impact on her and a whole
generation of her colleagues.  She told you that.  She told
you that she smoked because it was the thing to do.
And we started this case with information that
happened a long time before Donna, because we had to set the
stage for you, that when a person was growing up in that
era, they didn't understand.  The information wasn't out
there that while there were health claims about cigarettes,
everybody was doing it.  But as the information increased,
the cigarette industry, Philip Morris in particular, decided
we've got to recruit youngsters, because there's more
information coming out there, we've got a coffin nail that
we're selling, how are we going to get people to buy it?
That's a tough product to sell.  How are you going to do it?
Well, you don't talk so much about what the
product is, you wrap it up in a lot of advertising.  Their
own witness, came in through deposition -- I'm sorry, not 1686
 1
deposition.  Joseph Cullman explained that while there's
 2
information coming out there, we focused our efforts on
 3
advertising, that's how we built the Marlboro brand.  And
 4
once Donna started to smoke, as the 2012 Surgeon General's
 5
report will tell you, as a youngster, she was more likely to
 6
continue smoking, to become heavily addicted, be unable to
 7
quit, and to suffer a serious injury or death.  Donna is
 8
here today.  She has suffered a serious incurable injury.
 9
So she's just like that.
And counsel referred to litigation and what I am
going to be talking about in litigation science.  Mr. Jupe
tells you that outside the courthouse, go to the Surgeon
General's report, we agree with all them.  Well, please do.
That's in evidence in this case.  And what did they say
about whether choice -- what role choice has in a smoker
when it comes to the power and the grip of nicotine
addiction?  The 2014 consumer booklet, which I published to
you yesterday, is a nice short booklet and in that it
describes in succinct word, which we've not been as succinct
as we would like in this trial, because this case is very
important.  But that is a document that I would recommend to
you to start off with, because that's what this case is all
about.  
And what that document shows us is that addiction
is defined as a chronic relapsing brain disease that is 1687
 1
characterized by compulsive drug seeking and drug use
 2
despite harmful consequences.
 3
On this board, the reason I left it up, why, if
 4
Donna is getting all this information -- and you heard the
 5
evidence, I don't know that all this is exactly what we
 6
heard in court, but you'll be the judge of that, you're the
 7
judge of the facts.  But in any event, we're not going to
 8
dispute that there are times in Donna's life where she was
 9
given information that smoking could be hazardous.
Now, did Donna accept that that was going to
happen to her?  She did she accept that she was going to
develop PVD?  The testimony was, no, I didn't even think
that I -- I didn't know about PVD until 1992 when
Dr. Harding told me, you have PVD.  There was some
suggestion that Dr. Harding didn't believe that smoking
caused it.  It's the very first thing that he told Donna.
Donna you have PVD, it's caused by your smoking, you do need
to quit.  But Donna was an addicted smoker, like 90 percent
of teenagers who -- and that's one thing Dr. Werner
testified, that 50 percent overall of people to ever smoke
might become addicted.  But if you start smoking young, if
you smoke at least ten cigarettes a day, and Donna was, by
the time you turn 18, 90 percent chance, 90 percent of those
people more likely than not 90 percent of those people are
going to go on to become addicted smokers.  More importantly, Dr. Werner told us this smoker, Donna Brown,
  1688
 2
she's addicted.
 3
Now, luckily Donna in the last year has finally
 4
broken the shackles of addiction.  But when you're are
 5
evaluating what happened over the time and the information
 6
being out there, ask yourself, was she, in making her
 7
choices, suffering from an addiction?  And was that
 8
addiction substantially contributing to the choices that she
 9
made.  And if you look like Dr. Jupe tells you at the -- I'm
sorry, Mr. Jupe tells you, outside the courtroom they'll
tell you, look at the Surgeon General's reports.  The
Surgeon General is quite clear, nicotine addiction is the
fundamental reason, the substantial contributing reason, why
people persist in smoking and it is that process of
continuing to smoke pack after pack, year after year, that
leads, that substantially contributes to causing PVD.  And
that's what happened in Donna's case.  That's not in
dispute.  Well, it is in dispute, but the evidence has
overwhelmingly shown that Donna smoked for many, many years.
She started early and she became addicted, that when she was
faced with information about the hazards of smoking that she
didn't really believe it applied to her.  She did say she
was hardheaded.  That's not proof that she wasn't addicted,
that's proof that she was.  Compulsive drug seeking and use
despite knowledge of harmful consequences.  That's Donna 1689
 1
Brown.
 2
 3
Could I get the Elmo for one second.
Now, the only medical evidence that came in in
 4
this case from the doctors, let's start with Dr. Harding.
 5
Now, we've already said that Dr. Harding was -- said in no
 6
uncertain terms, he was asked the question, did Donna
 7
Brown's smoking substantially contribute to causing her PVD?
 8
And he said, yes, it certainly contributed.  It did
 9
substantially contribute.  That is what I told her, he said.
I don't exactly remember our first conversation, but with
Donna Brown at 40 years old coming in with the level and
severity of her PVD and I'm the doctor that did all the
surgeries on her and I've cared for her over the years and
I've looked at her risk factors.  If there were other things
that I had to be concerned about that we could control with
Donna, you don't think Dr. Harding would have told her that?
The only thing that he told Donna is you need to quit
smoking.
And the evidence in this case and it came -- more
of it came in today, is even prior to seeing Dr. Harding
from 1992 when she was diagnosed, Donna had already started
trying to quit smoking.  That's what Lindsay testified
through deposition today.  That's what Donna testified when
she was on the stand.  Didn't work.  It didn't work.  But
Donna kept trying.  She kept trying.  She kept trying.  She tried Chantix, she tried literally everything in the book.
 2
And there's no question that she was serious about wanting
  1690
 3
to quit.
 4
So earlier counsel said that the sole legal cause
 5
of Donna's injury was Donna's choice to smoke.  So it seems
 6
like in the litigation setting they're admitting that
 7
smoking was the sole cause of her disease.  But they're also
 8
telling us we need to look at all these other things, all
 9
these other medical records, which Dr. Jackson referred to
looking at a stack of records this thick.  You're getting
about a dozen of them that are coming back with you.  And
when you look at those documents, and they're in evidence,
ask yourself when are they?  And why did these records --
why these people have these various ailments?  And did this
chart show, as evidence did in this case, that Ms. Brown,
she's a smoker.  Ms. Brown's mother, yeah, she had all these
things going on.  She was a smoker.  Ms. Brown's brother,
he's a smoker.  That isn't on here until I added it.  So in
the courtroom, they're suggesting that there's all these
other reasons other than smoking why Donna suffered her
illness, but the evidence in this case from every doctor
that came in and from every witness that spoke at this trial
all of the evidence, not counsel's comments, not litigation
comments, but the evidence that came from the mouth of the
witnesses is that smoking matters.  It's the most 1691
 1
substantial risk factor that she had.
 2
Now, after Donna started to suffer from injuries
 3
and from surgeries and grafting procedures and have charley
 4
horses in her legs and going through all the various things
 5
that she had prior to her amputation, was Donna able to
 6
maintain the same level of mobility and physical activity
 7
that she had before?  No.  She testified to that.  Annelisa
 8
Smith testified to that.
 9
When you go through serious medical procedures
over all parts of your body over a series of years, we can't
always keep ourselves up in quite the same way.  But I will
also point out that that doesn't mean that her continued
smoking, her continued addiction, did not substantially
contribute to the progression of her disease.  It couldn't
have come more clear from the witness stand that when it
comes to progression of peripheral vascular disease in Donna
Brown, her continued smoking was like throwing kerosene on a
fire.  Dr. Harding in all his years of practice of medicine
had never seen anyone whose PVD progressed as quickly and
horrifically as Donna's did.  And he attributes that, most
significantly, the most substantial contributing factor, is
the fact that Donna continued to smoke, she wasn't able to
beat her addiction at that time.  But that is all evidence
of addiction.  That is not contrary to addiction.
The only other medical record there was suggestion 1692
 1
that we didn't show you, and the whole record is in
 2
evidence, you can go back and look at it.  This is exhibit
 3
605-Charlie.  But once again, this medical record what does
 4
it really tell us from 2003, the year that Donna's health
 5
had gotten so bad that her legs needed to be amputated?  She
 6
had high lipids at that point.  Does that really defeat
 7
cause in this case?  Is that really what this case is about?
 8
I submit to you that it's not.
 9
And if we've proven, which we have by the
preponderance of the evidence -- and that's all we have to
prove as to the first three questions on the verdict form,
is it more likely than not that Donna Brown was addicted?
There's nothing in the verdict form, there will be nothing
in the instructions about the strength of addiction.  That's
not a question that you have to consider.  The evidence is
that Donna was severely profoundly addicted.  But the
question you have to answer is just was she addicted?  Did
it matter?  Did it have anything to do with substantially
contributing to her continued smoking?  And did that
continued smoking substantially contribute, doesn't have to
be the only cause, did it matter, did it substantially
contribute?  And every witness that came in here told you
that it did.
So when you decide those questions Mr. Finch --
and you'll have to determine fault.  Now, we bear the burden 1693
 1
of proof on the first three questions.  On the question of
 2
fault as to Donna Brown, Philip Morris bears the burden of
 3
proof.  They need to show you what Donna did wrong when she
 4
started smoking as a teenager at a time that they were -- I
 5
showed you -- I'm not gonna go through all the documents,
 6
we've been through the documents, you will have the
 7
documents, but they were polling kids in the '50s and
 8
figuring out how do we -- how do we attract those smokers?
 9
How do we market our products to them?  Mr. Cullman could
not have been more clear about, you know, we wanted this
pack and how important this pack was.  And, you know, within
one month of putting out this material campaign, we moved
from the number six tobacco company to the number one in the
New York City market, and within a few years we were number
one in the country and we moved up and up and up from there.
Does advertising matter?  Did we prove more likely than not
that somehow Donna was the one person in a bubble that that
whole advertising campaign did not affect?
Because what do we know?  She said she saw ads,
she said that that's one of the things that she considered.
But she also said my peers.  Look at Exhibit 806.  I showed
it in evidence in this case.  That was part of Philip
Morris' marketing prowess.  If we can become the brand of
choice among this generation, it's gonna feed on itself.
The next generation of smokers, we're going to be the brand. And they are the brand.  So was she impacted by that?  Did
 2
she rely on that advertising?  I'll submit to you the
 3
question is yes and you need to consider that in determining
  1694
 4
fault in this case.
 5
But I'm not gonna put a number on it either, but
 6
just keep in mind when a person starts with that type of
 7
information environment, they make that choice not based on
 8
what is being said, what is being not said.  That's what
 9
this case is about when it comes to reliance.  They said,
how can -- how can she rely on something she didn't hear and
it wasn't said?  Well, the point of the matter is a
manufacturer needs to tell the truth about its product,
especially if it's an addictive drug, especially if it's an
addictive drug that you know that 88 percent of your
long-term customers are gonna start using that product
before they turn 18.  If you're selling a product that you
know is dangerous and defective, hazardous and addictive,
and you know that 88 percent of your customers are gonna
pick that product up before they're of age, before they're
legally 18, to vote or do other important things in life,
and that as a result of that they're likely to become
customers for life -- and look at the 1981 Philip Morris
sales documents where they actually look at that and say,
today's teenager is tomorrow's regular customer, they're the
most important part of our business.  And Philip Morris is going to suffer more because the number of teenagers was
 2
declining.  What about the suffering of those teenagers.
  1695
 3
Take that into account when you go back.
 4
MS. GALLAGHER:  Objection, Your Honor
 5
Williams-State Farm.

 7
THE COURT:  Sustained.
MR. LEDLIE:  Of this teenager, take into account
 8
the damages and suffering that teenager suffered as she
 9
became addicted and grew up and continued to smoke and
continued to smoke and hated it.  She testified that she did
not want to keep smoking.
Donna struggled with some problems in her life.
She knows what a drinking problem is.  She was able to break
that addiction.  But when it came to cigarettes, Donna
wasn't, not until recently.  And that's the truth.  That's
the evidence that came in in this case.  The power of the
nicotine addiction was just too strong for her until she was
finally able.
And what happened?  What happened?  Donna tells
you that -- we know that Donna quit smoking -- I'm sorry.
We know that Lindsay recalls Donna quitting smoking in the
'80s to '90s.  We know that Donna recalls the ugly guy, the
sea captain coming out, because when C. Everett Koop came
out and said nicotine is an addiction, it is a medical
problem, it is something that you need medical help with, 1696
 1
and from that point on, as is in evidence, that was crucial
 2
to understanding better ways to treat addiction and better
 3
ways for doctors and people to convey to smokers why it is
 4
so difficult to quit, that it is not just a matter of
 5
willpower, that there is more going on there and you need to
 6
just be prepared that some people are going to need a little
 7
more help.  Donna needed more help.  She was the kind of
 8
person that needed some pharmaceutical help and some other
 9
things to finally get through it.  And thank God she did
eventually.  
But what if that information had not been kept
within the internal walls of the Philip Morris company from
1959 forward?  What if they had been forthright about that
information?  And they shared it so that the doctors and
medical community could understand exactly why it is that so
many people are continuing to smoke, even after these health
dangers are being broadcast?  Why are they making that
choice?  Because they are addicted.  They're compelled to
use the drug and some of them are going to quit and,
unfortunately, some of them are not.  And the one that we're
here about, Donna Brown, who is in this courtroom, she
wasn't able to quit in time to avoid her disease.  
And so the question is, in light of that and in
light of the evidence in this case, who are you going to put
at fault and how much fault are you going to put on the 1697
 1
parties?  Well, you decide that.  You decide that question
 2
based on all the evidence.  But it's not fair to say that
 3
the company that sold the cigarettes, manufactured them and
 4
put them out there, and advertised and kept internal
 5
information that they knew, that somehow it's all my
 6
client's fault, that she doesn't deserve justice, a just
 7
verdict taking into account the evidence in the case, not
 8
the arguments of the lawyers.
 9
As to the damages, the only thing that I wanted to
point out is that this verdict form combines many elements
of damages into a single -- into single lines, past bodily
injury, resulting pain and suffering.  When you retire to
the jury room and consider evidence, you need to consider
not just in 1992, but you need to consider all of the harms
and all of the losses and what went into each of the
procedures as best as you recollect from the evidence that
came in.  This chart will not be back with you, but you'll
recall that Donna had not one, but multiple procedures to
both sides of her neck, that she had this aortic procedure,
that she had multiple -- couldn't even draw them all on her,
but multiple.  Remember Dr. Harding talking about having to
do this on multiple occasions on both legs.  Eventually the
disease progressed to such a point that she did require an
amputation and it was actually three different times, three
different times on each leg, because the disease was just 1698
 1
that far gone.  Dr. Harding tried to do as best he could,
 2
but it did require three different procedures.  
 3
And think about not just the surgical pain, but
 4
the other elements of damages, the disability, the mental
 5
anguish, both knowing from 1992 forward that if I can't give
 6
up these cigarettes, it's gonna cost me my legs, and not
 7
being able, not being able to successfully do it.  Think
 8
about what that must have been like for Donna.
 9
You heard the guilt that she had.  And she does.
But don't confuse guilt with fault.  Guilt is a recognition
that an addict is going to continue to use despite knowledge
of harm.  That is addiction.  That is what this case is
about.  There are inconveniences.  How did this
inconvenience Donna.  Each and every time you will have to
consider that, ability to enjoy the pleasures of life and
disfigurement, future bodily injury and resulting pain and
suffering.  And on that question, you know, I never disagree
with my good friend, Mr. Finch, on many things, but Donna
Brown is a fighter.  And I can't tell you how long Donna
Brown is going to be here.  You've seen her and you'll have
to evaluate your interpretation of the facts as to what her
future pain and suffering is going to be based on your
consideration of everything that you've learned in this
trial.
Lastly, the questions on the verdict form dealing 1699
 1
with punitive damages.  There are multiple questions, but
 2
they all revolve around the question why did this matter to
 3
Donna Brown.  Did it really matter, did it really matter
 4
that Philip Morris did engage in the unprecedented
 5
advertising campaign that Donna Brown was swept into?  Did
 6
that have anything to do with Donna Brown's smoking?  Did we
 7
prove by clear and convincing evidence that by 1967 when the
 8
special report, No. 248 -- I wish I could remember the
 9
exhibit number, but special report, Exhibit 248, the health
filter document which we put up on the board earlier that
said in 1964 we see some adults are quitting.  Not that
much, but we really aren't too concerned, because we've got
4500 to 5,000 youngsters every day that are picking up
smoking and they're going to be -- we're going to recruit
them that's what the document says not my word, 527 is that
document.
You want to talk about relating this to Donna
Brown, this is 1967.  Donna Brown's in high school, Donna
Brown is smoking Marlboros.  It's no accident.  It's no
question about that.  We've talked about relying on the
admission that if all this information had come out, even
Mr. Jupe, who by the way, Philip Morris and their
statements, they're talking about in 1999, we changed our
ways, we are a different company.  We are here about what
Philip Morris was doing in 1965, '66, '67, '68, '69, and all 1700
 1
the way down the line, okay?  Because we are here about
 2
Donna Brown.  If you decide that Philip Morris needs to be
 3
punished in this case because of their omissions in failing
 4
to tell the truth about their product impacted her in a real
 5
way and the evidence is that when the information got out
 6
there when Surgeon General Koop got out there, when they
 7
came up with better treatments Donna Brown got them, she got
 8
every one she could.  So there's evidence out there that
 9
information mattered to Donna Brown, and she acted on that
information.  
So there's more than enough evidence, there's more
than clear and convincing, there's no contrary evidence that
information like that mattered to Donna Brown and that
information was kept secret from her and from the public
health community like her doctors in developing ways to help
her deal with her addiction.  
The time has come for the lawyers to quit talking.
The time has come for you to embark on the things that
you've been waiting for since day one, which is to talk
about this case, to talk to one another about this case, and
when you retire to the jury room you will have a voice.  You
will have one voice.  You will determine what the evidence
has proven in this case, you will determine what justice
requires in this case.  And we and Donna Brown thank you for
the attention that you've given to all counsel in this case, 1701
 1
through all the evidence in this case.  The burden of
 2
proving the case I have shouldered.  Now you share the
 3
burden of judging this case and ensuring that when a verdict
 4
is read in this case, that justice is fully done.  There's
 5
no half justice.  That isn't justice.  We need our full
 6
measure of justice as you determine it.  Thank you.
