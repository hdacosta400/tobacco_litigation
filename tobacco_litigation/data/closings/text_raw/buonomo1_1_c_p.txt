24             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you, Your Honor.
25             Good afternoon.

 1             We have tried, tried, not to waste a
 2   single moment of your time.  So let's go directly to
 3   the questions that you are going to have to answer
 4   on the verdict form in this case.
 5             The issue, as you heard in opening
 6   statement, is did Matthew Buonomo have an illness
 7   before November of 1996 that was caused by an
 8   addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine.  So if
 9   the answer to that question is yes, then the answer
10   to both of these questions are yes.
11             Did Matthew Buonomo have chronic
12   obstructive pulmonary disease before February 21st,
13   1996, and secondly, was he addicted to cigarettes
14   containing nicotine which caused that illness.
15             If you answer no to either question, your
16   verdict is for RJR.  If you answer yes and yes, you
17   are finding that Mr. Bounomo is part of a certain
18   group of people and you will move on to phase two of
19   this trial.
20             In order to answer those questions, the
21   judge is going to instruct you on the law.  And, by
22   the way, that verdict form, you will have it in
23   writing to fill out.  The judge is also going to
24   give you the law that you need to follow in
25   answering those questions, and that will be in

 1   writing.  But there are a couple things about the
 2   law I want to discuss with you because you need to
 3   know what they are when you are deciding how to
 4   answer these questions.
 5             The first thing is a concept we touched on
 6   a couple times in this trial already, right at the
 7   top, something called the greater weight of the  8   evidence.
 9             The greater weight of the evidence means
10   the more persuasive and convincing force and effect
11   of the entire evidence in the case.
12             It is important on every issue that you
13   are deciding that you apply the correct standard and
14   follow the law for this kind of case.  In other
15   cases, there are some cases where -- criminal cases
16   where the defendant starts out -- I hope this would
17   work because we just put this together.  But the
18   defendant starts out presumed innocent, and the
19   prosecution has the burden of presenting so much
20   evidence that the scales not only tip in the other
21   direction but there is no longer any doubt, any
22   reasonable doubt about the guilt of the defendant.
23             In cases like this, the scales start out
24   even.  If they end even, we lose.  We have the
25   burden of proving our case.  So if they start even

 1   and end even, we lose.  But if they tip, the greater
 2   weight tips slightly in our direction on any issue,
 3   then that issue must be decided in our favor.
 4             I think, and I'm going to discuss with you
 5   now why I think we have proven this case far beyond
 6   that.  But every issue that you come across, the
 7   first question you need to ask yourself and remind
 8   yourselves about is when we say decide something,
 9   what is the standard, who is more likely right than
10   wrong.  Are we more likely right than wrong.
11             You have heard, and Mr. McPharlin, right
12   in opening statement, said there is basically two
13   possible answers to the questions.  Either he had
14   emphysema and COPD -- And we are going to get -- We
15   will talk a little bit to make sure it is absolutely
16   clear that emphysema is a disease that is COPD.
17   There are other diseases that are also COPD.  But
18   emphysema is COPD.  And he had it caused by an
19   addiction to cigarettes which is what all his
20   treating doctors said.  All those doctors and all
21   those medical records, there was not one that
22   disagreed with that.  And that requires yes, yes.
23             The other possibility which RJR argues is
24   true is that he was not addicted, never addicted,
25   not a day in his life, and he never had COPD, and he

 1   never had emphysema.
 2             I almost had the guts to just put in the
 3   medical records and rest our case because the very
 4   fact -- And I didn't so you are here longer.  But
 5   the very fact that he was treated for 13 years by 21
 6   doctors who diagnosed and treated COPD, emphysema,
 7   is way more than a slight tip.  It is very, very
 8   strong evidence in and of itself.  If they are going
 9   to overcome that, they are going to need to present 10   some very, very compelling evidence to explain to
11   you how, right here in our community, 21 doctors
12   treated a man for 13 years for the wrong disease.
13             So what evidence do they have?  They
14   brought you four witnesses who are medical doctors.
15   When you look at each of the things they testified
16   to, there is another jury instruction including
17   consider the believability of the witness.  There
18   are factors for you to consider.  When you look at
19   their testimony, it is appropriate to consider that
20   unlike the treating doctors who made these diagnoses
21   without any lawsuit in mind, they were hired by one
22   of the parties in this case.  In addition, they were
23   paid an incredible amount of money to come to those
24   conclusions.  Some of them said they hope to have
25   more cases.  They all have apparently the same 15 or

 1   20 cases already.  They are making a lot in each
 2   case, and they have an incentive to continue making
 3   that much money.
 4             So anything they say has a little less
 5   credibility, and maybe a lot less than somebody who
 6   wrote it in a medical record without any view of a
 7   lawsuit and who testified to it through days and
 8   days -- I mean those videos seemed long to sit
 9   through, but they were a tiny, tiny portion of what
10   those doctors had to sit through, questioning and
11   questioning and questioning, multiple occasions,
12   multiple days.  And that wasn't even all the doctors
13   who had to go through that.  They said those things
14   as doctors who don't testify in lawsuits.  Several
15   of them said I have never before.  And some of the
16   witnesses here said well, this is my first time in a
17   courtroom, but they have testified many times at
18   depositions.  These doctors were strangers to this
19   courtroom, this process.
20             It struck me.  Dr. Cummings said something
21   on cross examination.  They were asking him about
22   how he had said something to some of the other
23   people who are concerned about the diseases caused
24   by smoking in our society, that you have to think
25   before you talk to the press.  If you are a doctor,

 1   used to dealing with regular people in regular
 2   situations, it might not come across the way you
 3   expect in a 30-second sound bite on television.
 4   Those people like Dr. Cummings, concerned with
 5   public health, for years and years and years were
 6   getting drowned out by professionals who knew how to
 7   talk on television.
 8             And the danger is when you consider the
 9   weight to give any witness, any witness' testimony
10   in this case, the danger is that somebody who is
11   good at talking doesn't mean they are good at 12   medicine -- who has been picked because they are
13   good at testifying.  We didn't pick any of those
14   treating doctors.  They were all the doctors who
15   came in and treated him.  Not our experts.  They're
16   his doctors.  But the ones that have been picked
17   because of how they appear, just like the doctors
18   and the PR people who for years and years said, like
19   one doctor today, we don't know what causes lung
20   cancer, and they said it well enough that it drowned
21   out the truth.
22             So you can consider that when you give the
23   weight, when you decide the weight to give any
24   testimony.  That's why it seems to me we are not
25   even close to who is slightly right.  But on each of

 1   the questions, you have to look at this is not a
 2   close call.
 3             Let me take you through the individual
 4   issues that are involved in this question.  Whether
 5   you look at it as one decision, did he have a
 6   disease caused by an addiction to cigarettes, or you
 7   look at it as two like the verdict form does, there
 8   are several parts.  The first one was, was he
 9   addicted.
10             You heard from his treating doctors that
11   he was.  It is obvious.  It is an addictive drug.
12   He tried to quit and he couldn't.
13             They can come in here and say that he
14   wasn't, and they can hire someone to say that he
15   wasn't addicted, but you can use your common sense.
16   In fact, you have to use your common sense.
17             And you know essentially what addiction
18   means.  By any definition, any possible way to
19   define it, like one of his daughter's defined it,
20   when we were running low on cigarette, I saw him
21   take the butts almost spent out of the ashtray and
22   try to straighten them out and smoke them.  That is
23   a definition of addiction.  That is him.  He was
24   addicted.  Or if he used the Fagerstrom test or the
25   Heaviness of Smoking or even the DSM their guy used,

 1   there is no doubt.  It is not even close.
 2             Dr. Cummings is one of the world leading
 3   experts on tobacco addiction.  Todd asked him
 4   someone who smokes three packs per day -- He didn't
 5   need to get to all of this information if you
 6   remember.
 7             But let's look at Mr. Bounomo.  The amount
 8   of cigarettes he smoked, when he smoked in the
 9   morning, when he smoked at night, whether he had
10   daily use, symptoms he had when he tried to quit,
11   the fact he did try and quit and failed, the age he
12   started, the length of time he smoked, is that
13   person addicted he was asked?  Yes, there is no 14   doubt.
15             And he trains the people who determine for
16   the state of New York on the Quit Line if someone is
17   addicted.  If somebody said this person wasn't
18   addicted, what would happen to them?  It is
19   ridiculous.
20             If you want to use a technical definition,
21   and remember Dr. Marks said I don't know, Dr. Marks
22   was the psychiatrist they brought in to say this
23   individual was not addicted.  He said I don't know
24   if you can use these other definitions of addiction,
25   the Fagerstrom test, Heaviness of Smoking Index

 1   which was just two questions, ones used all the time
 2   by doctors.  He said I don't know if it has been
 3   validated.  I asked him what he meant by that.  He
 4   said you have to do a study to follow people and see
 5   if the people that show that they are addicted under
 6   this test really are.  But you already heard from
 7   Dr. Cummings that is exactly what they did.
 8             Whether Dr. Marks knows it or not, it was
 9   a long study over many years, all types of people
10   from very limited non-daily use to very heavy
11   smokers, and this was the highest predictor as he
12   called it, the highest correlation to whether
13   somebody would have difficulty quitting because they
14   were addicted.
15             If you remember, when we scored it with
16   Dr. Marks, their expert, under this test, he said at
17   the very least it is high dependence, and it is
18   quite possibly very high dependence which is how it
19   was when I scored it with his wife.  With his wife
20   it was at least eight and possibly ten.  With Dr.
21   Marks it was at least seven and possibly ten.  But
22   any score over seven, your level of dependence is
23   high, you're not in control of your smoking.
24             By the way, we are not saying -- This
25   really isn't an issue for this phase because you are

 1   going to decide how much fault Matthew Buonomo had
 2   in the next phase.  But I want to make it clear
 3   because this has been raised a lot.  We're not
 4   saying if you are addicted you don't have free
 5   choice.  But there is a physical addiction that
 6   results in what is called diminished free choice, a
 7   powerful physical resistance to acting on your free
 8   choice.  Doesn't mean you can't quit.  We never said
 9   that.  But with smoking this high, your levels of
10   dependence this high, you are not in control of your
11   smoking.
12             One other thing that Dr. Marks said and I
13   expect it will come up in closing when the RJR
14   lawyers talk.  On this test, even a zero shows
15   dependence.  Even a zero is addiction.  I said do 16   you know why, Doctor?  Do you know why a zero shows
17   very low.  Very low obviously but, why it still
18   shows some dependence.  No.  He asked me why.  But I
19   wasn't allowed to answer a witness.  But I'll tell
20   you.
21             This is a test for daily smokers as Dr.
22   Cummings told you.  Daily smokers by definition, in
23   fact the definition that Dr. Marks admitted to, that
24   RJR's expert admitted to, daily smokers have some
25   level of addiction because as Dr. Marks said in the

 1   courtroom, do you agree that cigarette smoking is an
 2   addictive and chronic relapsing disorder.  Yes.  He
 3   had to answer yes to that because that is the
 4   definition.  It is an addictive and chronic
 5   relapsing disorder, cigarette smoking.  If you are a
 6   daily smoker, that correlates to some level of
 7   addiction.  If you smoke every day.  It can be very
 8   low.  As you saw, zero is very low dependence.  But
 9   once you have a daily smoker by definition, by the
10   definition Dr. Marks admitted to, you have some
11   level of addiction.
12             By their own expert's admission, he scores
13   on that test addicted, and very, very highly
14   addicted.  I'll briefly remind you when they say he
15   didn't really want to quit and made no serious
16   attempts to quit, he first tried cutting down.  When
17   that didn't work he tried to quit cold turkey by
18   eliminating cigarettes.  This was in the mid-'70s.
19   He tried different things with different quit
20   attempts.  Sometimes chewing gum.  He thought that
21   would work.
22             To us a lot of things about this case
23   sound strange.  But you have to remember not only
24   was it a different time, but the things we know to
25   be true like the air we breath, they really didn't

 1   know.  In fact, I was shocked to find out when I was
 2   questioning Connie, I asked her did you know that it
 3   was proven in the '70s that smoking was harmful, and
 4   she said no, it wasn't.  She didn't say no, I didn't
 5   know.  She said no, it wasn't proven then.  We will
 6   get to in a minute why people thought that.
 7             But the steps they took to try to quit
 8   were based on what they knew.  They did not know all
 9   the things we know right now before we ever came
10   into this courtroom, and certainly after what we
11   heard.  And Connie even said that, I wish we had, I
12   didn't understand why Matt was acting like that
13   until I watched Dr. Henningfield on that video.
14             To the point where when they were
15   discussing quitting, he actually pounded on the
16   table his fists and he said you don't know what I'm
17   going through.  And she didn't. 18             This is not possible, RJR's answers. Tried
19   chewing gum.  Substituting smoking with candy and
20   peanuts.  I remember my grandparents doing it.
21   Water filter was a smoking aid, a cease smoking aid
22   for the time.  It seemed technologically advanced
23   back then.  You put a filter on it and you were
24   supposed to get less nicotine and you can wean
25   yourself off.  He tried that.  Didn't work.

 1   Throwing away the cigarettes.  We heard from his
 2   granddaughter all things the family would try to do,
 3   word games, to take his mind off it.  They actually
 4   played this word search game.  She would come over
 5   especially to keep his mind off smoking when he was
 6   trying to quit.
 7             Why was Matthew Buonomo more addicted than
 8   other smokers?  For example, Dr. Marks who told you
 9   he picked up a cigarette at 12 or 13, coughed, hated
10   it and never smoked again.  Why was he different?
11   Well, we don't know entirely why.  We just know he
12   was more addicted.  But we do know some of the
13   factors.
14             There are certain factors that will result
15   in a lower level of addiction.  One of the most
16   important is the age you start smoking a lot.
17             When your brain is still developing,
18   remember nicotine actually physically changes your
19   brain.  If those changes occur when you are 13, 14,
20   15 years old it is much harder to quit.  Shorter
21   duration, some people when they wake up, and we
22   don't know why yet, reach for the cigarette.  There
23   is a biological, physical urge for the cigarette
24   when they wake up.  Some people, they don't.  They
25   don't have that physical urge that makes them think

 1   of a cigarette.  Some person may be all the way on
 2   the left side, very low.  But if you are like Matt,
 3   starting younger, heavier smoker, longer duration,
 4   smoking very early in the morning, those are the
 5   factors that result in his powerful addiction.
 6             I'm going to stop talking about addiction.
 7             If he is not addicted, nobody is.
 8             Let's talk about did he have COPD.  You
 9   have the entire medical record.  That still exists.
10   There were some things -- Both parties have subpoena
11   power to go out and get records, and we did from
12   every hospital and doctor.  But some doctors said we
13   don't have them anymore or they said this is what we
14   have.  Like you heard Broward General didn't have
15   that sleep study.
16             But everything we have is here.  The
17   defense and the plaintiffs have also marked certain
18   things separately so it will make it easier for you
19   to look at some of the things that were shown during 20   trial.  But you are free to look through everything
21   in here.  I just wanted to give you a flavor of what
22   those records looked like because if you read them,
23   you know he had COPD.
24             Doctor after doctor -- I have been using
25   the 21 doctors.  But that is just doctors who

 1   diagnosed or treated him for COPD.  There are other
 2   doctors involved with ruling out the congestive
 3   heart failure as a serious problem.  And by the way,
 4   he did have congestive heart failure.  There is no
 5   doubt he was diagnosed with it.  We will talk about
 6   whether that was a cause of his death in a minute.
 7             You'll notice whether it was a cause of
 8   his death is not one of the questions on the verdict
 9   form.  That is for phase two.  The only issue is
10   whether he even had COPD, not what killed him in
11   2008, but whether in 1995 when he went to the
12   hospital he had COPD.
13             I did a very bad job of explaining
14   something to you with the witnesses although they
15   said it, but I kept trying to cut our part of those
16   videos down, down, down, down.  Then we started
17   talking about terms immediately, and some of the
18   other doctors came in, and I think it was clear.
19             But Dr. Klotz admitted this.  The treating
20   doctors all testified to this.  COPD which means
21   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it means
22   you've got something in your lungs, continually,
23   chronically, obstructing in your lungs, the normal
24   function, so it makes it difficult to breathe.
25             That could happen in different ways.  You

 1   can have COPD from different physical causes.  One
 2   of those is emphysema.  If you have emphysema you
 3   have COPD.  If you have chronic bronchitis you have
 4   COPD.  If you have both you have COPD.  That is why
 5   Dr. Klotz, their expert, said COPD is an umbrella
 6   disease that includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis,
 7   or both.  Some patients have both.  Some have
 8   emphysema.  A lot of the doctors, the treating
 9   doctors, use it interchangeably with COPD.
10             Dr. Kelly Adams who we didn't hear from,
11   every one of these doctors was available for the
12   defense to talk to.  And many of them who you didn't
13   hear from, they were talked to.  They were deposed.
14   You didn't hear anything from any treater that
15   disagrees with any of these.
16             If you go through any of the medical
17   records you'll see again and again from doctor after
18   doctor the diagnosis of COPD, probable COPD,
19   exacerbation of COPD, emphysema.  In fact, look on
20   May 13th, 1995.  Dr. Bolton, a pulmonologist, a
21   specialist in lung function, COPD, chronic 22   obstructive lung disease.  He called it lung instead
23   of pulmonary, chronic obstructive lung disease with
24   emphysematous COPD and probable chronic bronchitis.
25   But he is not necessarily diagnosing that.

 1             Severe lung disease is written in the
 2   records and you heard it from the treaters.  Severe.
 3   Show us 72 for a minute.  A different summary.  It
 4   shows how the different treatments they were doing
 5   were affecting his oxygen saturation.  Again, doctor
 6   after doctor, how the treatments are affecting and
 7   how they are going to change the treatments.
 8             KS73.  They go on and on like that.  S4.
 9   Just a list of some of the doctors.  This isn't even
10   complete in the different specialties who treated
11   and diagnosed the COPD.  He was seen by seven
12   cardiologists, seven cardiologists.  Pulmonologists.
13   Internists.  Radiologists.  Hospitalists.  And you
14   did not and will not ever hear one of them say that
15   he never had COPD, never had emphysema, he wasn't
16   addicted, that he died of congestive heart failure,
17   none.
18             Doctors that flew in from other parts of
19   the country to say that.  In fact, let's be clear
20   about one thing.  Of all the experts who came in
21   here for the defense, only one of them said he
22   didn't have COPD.  All the others if you notice
23   didn't say that.  I have no opinion on whether he
24   had COPD.
25             Only one, Dr. Klotz, said he didn't have

 1   COPD, he had emphysema.  Well, he had bullae
 2   emphysema.  We went through that three times.  And I
 3   still don't know.  Hopefully you do.  Because I
 4   still don't know what he was saying.  He said he
 5   didn't have emphysema.  So I said okay, he did not
 6   have emphysema.  Then I said once I wrote it, he
 7   does not have emphysema, he didn't like it written
 8   down like that.  He said I didn't say that.  I went
 9   and crossed out the not.  He said it was small
10   bullae emphysema.  And he said in his opinion it was
11   October 1995 according to the chart.  Because the
12   X-ray that says bullae, that finds the bullae
13   changes in the lungs which is emphysema --
14   emphysematous destruction in the lungs and they see
15   it on the X-ray -- was October 1995.  So there is no
16   doubt about the date either.  Even the radiologist
17   said emphysematous changes, which he finally
18   admitted means of or related to emphysema, in every
19   CT scan he ever saw but he wouldn't give a date when
20   he first got emphysema.  Dr. Klotz did.  This is
21   their expert because obviously all the treaters
22   agree.  And there is only one doctor you heard from
23   who said you can't diagnose COPD without a pulmonary 24   function test.  That was Dr. Klotz.  But remember,
25   after I wrote this all out, his opinions in the

 1   case, it turns out he said the exact opposite a
 2   short time ago.  The exact opposite.
 3             You don't need a pulmonary function test.
 4   I mean you can see the emphysema on the X-ray.
 5   People were getting emphysema before there were any
 6   pulmonary function tests.  People were getting COPD
 7   before there were any pulmonary function tests.  One
 8   of you asked him what would you do if somebody came
 9   with these symptoms which clinically all those
10   doctors could see, I know what this is, it is COPD.
11   What would you do?  I give him a pulmonary function
12   test.  Why?  Because he has COPD.  He said then I
13   would diagnose it.
14             It is the same thing they said year after
15   year.  We need more proof, not enough tests.  We
16   don't know if smoking is bad for you.  We don't know
17   if it is addictive.  It is not proven.  Now they are
18   saying they need one more test.
19             I have a bunch of medical records.  But
20   let me play you -- Can we have the video clip Bolton
21   243?
22             "Question:  Is there any questions in your
23   mind Matthew Buonomo had emphysema?
24             "Answer:  No question in my mind.
25             "Question:  Any question in your mind

 1   Matthew Buonomo's death was caused by emphysema?
 2             "Answer:  There is no question that the
 3   patient died from emphysema.

15             "Question:  How was emphysema diagnosed in
16   Mr. Bounomo's case?
17             "Answer:  His COPD was diagnosed through
18   X-rays.
19             "Question:  Do you believe that X-rays are
20   a sufficient or adequate way to diagnose emphysema
21   or COPD?
22             "Answer:  Better than the pulmonary
23   function test.  Yes.  I believe so.
24             Was COPD caused by his addiction?  Really
25   that is kind of the other part of this.  I want to 1834
 1   show you one of the jury instructions on that.
 2             When we are talking about whether the
 3   addiction caused COPD, there is a legal definition
 4   of what that means, cause.  Remember you are going
 5   to have these back there.  But remember there are
 6   two important parts of this deposition.
 7             First of all, an addiction is a legal
 8   cause of an injury if it directly and in the natural
 9   and continuous sequence produces or contributes
10   substantially to producing such injury so that it
11   can reasonably be said that but for the addiction to
12   cigarettes containing nicotine the injury would not
13   have occurred.  But for the addiction, no injury.
14   If he wasn't addicted, he wouldn't have gotten the
15   disease.  That is what cause means.  If he was
16   addicted, he gets the disease.  If he is not
17   addicted, he doesn't.
18             It is important to remember the second
19   paragraph because it is a cause.  You see, there can
20   be a lot of causes that if you take one out it
21   doesn't happen.  Car accident.  Somebody runs a red
22   light and hits somebody.  That other person didn't
23   do anything wrong.  But if they hadn't gotten in
24   their car that morning there wouldn't have been an
25   accident.  That is also a Bolton cause.  There can

 1   be several things if you take them away you don't
 2   have the outcome.
 3             In this case you got addiction.  You take
 4   it away there is no COPD.  And we are going to get
 5   briefly into how addiction drives disease.  They are
 6   going to say failure to quit.  Doesn't matter.  That
 7   isn't your issue whether he failed to quit.  Fault
 8   is for phase two.  How cigarettes are designed.  The
 9   choices RJR made.  There are a lot of reasons that
10   resulted in this disease, a lot of causes.
11             But if the addiction contributed
12   substantially, and if you take it away, you wouldn't
13   have gotten the disease, then it is the cause.  If
14   he wasn't addicted, he wouldn't have been smoking
15   that many cigarettes and he wouldn't have gotten the
16   disease.  So the second paragraph specifically says
17   addiction need not be the only cause.
18             Your Honor, can I take an additional ten
19   minutes out of rebuttal?
20             THE COURT:  Yes.  I didn't know why you
21   didn't reserve more to begin with.
22             MR. UUSTAL:  I thought I was more concise
23   than I am.
24             Sorry.  It doesn't add any total time to
25   what you have to sit through.

 1             So the only issue on this is would he have  2   gotten sick if he wasn't addicted.
 3             First of all, does smoking cause COPD.
 4   And obviously it does.  There was no witness who
 5   denied that.  In fact, I think even Dr. Klotz
 6   admitted that.  Yes.
 7             Cigarette smoke does not cause emphysema.
 8   Actually he took this back.  He said this at first.
 9   Cigarette smoke does not cause emphysema in every
10   case.  It causes emphysema in 99 percent of cases,
11   actually about 99-and-a-half percent.  But he took
12   that back.  And he said -- Talking about Matthew
13   Buonomo now specifically, an expert for the defense.
14   More likely than not, the bullae emphysema you found
15   was caused by his addiction to smoking cigarettes.
16             The lawyers have met with him like he told
17   you for many, many hours, so he was careful to say
18   -- I'm not saying the addiction caused it but it was
19   caused by his smoking cigarettes.  So all the
20   treating doctors and their own expert admits it was
21   caused by smoking.
22             It is so strongly linked that Dr. Klotz
23   initially said 99.5 percent of the cases.  It is so
24   strongly linked that Dr. Marks, their guy who came
25   in who used this book, the DSM, to say he wasn't

 1   addicted had to admit that the DSM said a symptom of
 2   nicotine addiction is COPD.  That is how strong the
 3   language is.  If you see someone with COPD, you can
 4   consider that a sign of nicotine addiction, because
 5   the addiction drives the smoking, the amount of
 6   smoking that is needed to cause the damage in the
 7   lungs that results in COPD.  Someone not addicted
 8   doesn't smoke as much.  That is not enough smoking
 9   to cause the COPD.  The addiction drives the
10   exposure to the things in the cigarettes.
11             He switched to filters.  Remember when
12   people started talking about cigarettes might be
13   bad?  He switched to filters to be safe.  We know
14   now those filters do not filter out the carcinogens
15   and the other bad substances.  And once you get a
16   sufficient level of exposure, you will develop the
17   damage to the lung, and if you're not addicted you
18   just don't smoke enough to get that exposure.
19             Dr. Cummings talked about why it is hard
20   to quit.  This is how the addiction drives the
21   smoking.  It is hard to quit.  The main factor is
22   how it is designed.  Cigarettes engineered that way.
23   Precisely.
24             MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
25             THE COURT:  Overruled.

 1             MR. UUSTAL:  This is testimony in this
 2   case that this witness testified to.  Precisely,
 3   yes, they are.  And who's choice is that.  That is  4   the cigarette company's, Reynolds.  If they chose
 5   to, they could take the nicotine out.  Nicotine
 6   addicts wouldn't smoke because they are smoking to
 7   get the nicotine.  If they took the nicotine out,
 8   kids who smoked couldn't get addicted.  But it is
 9   this addiction that drives the level of smoking.
10             If you look at the parts of the cigarette
11   that are designed to feed the addiction which
12   increases the exposure, you see the chemical -- Dr.
13   Cummings testified about this -- You see the
14   chemical compounds that are added.  They added
15   flavorings to control the burn rate, to control
16   ventilation.
17             MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.  Phase
18   two.
19             THE COURT:  Sustained.  Take that down.
20   Take that down.  Thank you.
21             MR. UUSTAL:  The way the cigarette is
22   designed is to feed the addiction.  This one this
23   morning I cut and pasted from the transcript so I
24   don't have it fancy.  Dr. Cummings was explaining
25   how the addiction feeds the development of the

 1   disease.  It is directly related to the disease we
 2   see from smoking.  It is the people addicted who use
 3   the product repeatedly.  He is talking about what he
 4   has seen in his studies.  It is the people addicted
 5   and use the product repeatedly usually at a high
 6   level for many years that get the disease.  Social
 7   smokers don't get the disease related to cigarette
 8   smoking.  Heavy cigarette smokers are the ones that
 9   get the cancer, the COPD, the heart disease.  It is
10   directly correlated.
11             He is an epidemiologist.  That is what he
12   does.  Those are the people that first discovered
13   that cigarette smoking was harmful and the cigarette
14   companies said it is just epidemiology.  They are
15   the ones who discovered it.  From his
16   epidemiological study, he can tell -- that just
17   means looking at people, groups, over periods of
18   time and see what factors have what outcomes.  Heavy
19   addiction is the factor that causes COPD.
20             This will give you a brief kind of
21   physical example of the different type of exposure
22   you get if you are addicted compared to a social
23   smoker.  This is one or two packs a day compared to
24   a pack a month.  You can see obviously that the
25   exposure to the toxins in nicotine is far, far, far

 1   greater.  So it is the addiction that drives the
 2   disease.
 3             I will be done in a few minutes.
 4             They used to say cigarettes were not
 5   addictive.  Now we hear cigarettes were not  6   addictive to Matthew Buonomo.  It used to be we
 7   don't know if cigarettes cause disease, we need more
 8   tests.
 9             MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
10             THE COURT:  Overruled.
11             MR. UUSTAL:  Now we hear we don't know if
12   cigarettes caused disease for Mr. Bounomo, we need
13   more tests.  Same thing.  But if he is not addicted
14   and his COPD wasn't caused by smoking, then we are
15   right back to the old days, because if someone that
16   smokes like him isn't addicted and someone with this
17   amount of medical records undisputed by every doctor
18   who treated him for 13 years didn't get COPD from
19   his addiction to smoking, then no one does.
20             I'm going to have a chance to talk to you
21   again after RJR is done.  I promise you and so does
22   the judge I'm sure will make sure it will be much
23   shorter than this.  We have a set amount of time but
24   I have split mine.
25             It has been a long road.  I appreciate

 1   some of the things in this case were not as exciting
 2   as they could have been, especially the videos.
 3   Phase two, no videos, I promise.  It will be much
 4   shorter if you answer yes to both questions
 5   regarding the phase two.  It is shorter in total.
 6   And there are no videos.
 7             MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
 8             THE COURT:  Overruled.
 9             MR. UUSTAL:  That is the point where
10   you'll assign fault to Mr. Bounomo for his choices,
11   and you'll hear the evidence which you have not yet
12   heard about the fault of others.
13             MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
14             THE COURT:  Sustained.
15             We will take a stretch break until 2:35.
16   You are excused until 2:35.
17             (Brief recess)
11             THE COURT:  Mr. Uustal.
12             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you, Your Honor.
13             Proof.  How many times did we just hear
14   that word?  There is no proof.  Same thing we have
15   been hearing for 50 years.  How many doctors did
16   they want us to bring in?  Would ten have been
17   enough?  Fifteen?  This is proof.
18             I mean, I don't know what RJR means by the
19   word proof.  But the evidence, evidence is any
20   witness.  Everything Connie said is evidence.  Like
21   any other piece of evidence, you decide to accept it
22   or reject it.  But what she said alone is evidence
23   that can tip the scales that start out even.
24             They spent days interrogating the treating
25   doctors in this case.  They could have called in

 1   anyone.  If any doctor supported what they said, we
 2   would have heard from them.  This is all his
 3   doctors.  They didn't want to come in here.  It is
 4   not fun.  You heard it from Dr. Henningfield.  It is
 5   not fun to testify against RJR.  Think about all the
 6   time away from their practices in those depositions.
 7   It is not fun for them.  But you heard from an RJR
 8   doctor it is fun to testify for a tobacco company.
 9             I felt during Mr. Geise's remarks that I
10   was running around -- Not running around but moving
11   around trying to find things because I have to
12   defend every page in here.  What do you think I
13   could do with $200,000 for doctors and untold
14   lawyers from all over the country picking over those
15   records to come up with something to argue about?
16   I'll show you some of the things.
17             This was just shown to you in RJR's
18   closing.  This is the first CT report, the one done
19   to rule out lung cancer.  We know why they would do
20   a CT scan to look for lung cancer in a patient who
21   has been smoking as long as he has.  The radiologist
22   they brought in didn't know.  Didn't know that
23   smoking causes lung cancer.  But we know.
24             They were looking for lung cancer.  You
25   just heard this report says nothing about COPD.  But

 1   it does underneath that blowup.  The clinical  2   diagnosis was COPD.  The CT scan was to look for
 3   lung cancer.  And it says COPD, but not in this
 4   blowup.  The very next one you were shown says,
 5   well, Dr. Bolton agreed that CT scan didn't show any
 6   signs of emphysema and that the question was after
 7   you read this you were asked you didn't hear from
 8   Dr. Bolton that he read that CT scan and it said
 9   anything different.  You did hear from Dr.
10   Dautenhahn, their radiologist, that agreed.  But
11   guess what is missing?  The film.  Dr. Bolton
12   couldn't have looked at that film at the deposition
13   and agreed because he didn't have it, and Dr.
14   Dautenhahn admitted that he didn't have it.
15             Somebody else we found, his daughter.  His
16   personality, did it change when he quit smoking in
17   1995?  That doesn't mean the day he quit smoking.  I
18   think you all know that.
19             After a long exchange in a long deposition
20   she said once he quit smoking, he was the same
21   person, but not while he was going through
22   withdrawal.
23             You heard that when Dr. Issa said that
24   when you see CHF in these medical records, it means
25   cor pulmonale rightsided heart failure caused by

 1   COPD.  But he is not a cardiologist.  And Dr. Yount
 2   is.  So Dr. Yount knows what it means when it says
 3   congestive heart failure in these records.  But
 4   guess what?  Dr. Issa wrote CHF.  He knew what it
 5   means because he wrote it.  Then he was asked about
 6   it, specifically that.
 7             Can you put up 160?
 8             "Question:  Show me in your record where
 9   you used the word right ventricular strain?
10             "Answer:  We usually don't use that word.
11   We usually put it for simplicity, we call it
12   congestive heart failure.
13             "Question:  So would you agree then in
14   your medical record you never used the term right
15   ventricular strain?
16             "Answer:  I would say that it is
17   highly unlikely that I called it that because it's
18   obvious when I signed a note or sent it to another
19   medical -- somebody else in the medical field,
20   whether it is a cardiologist or a pulmonologist,
21   they understand looking at the records and looking
22   at what we write this is, that's what we are
23   writing.
24             So there are two points there.  The first
25   one is he knows what he meant when he wrote

 1   congestive heart failure, and it is an important
 2   point that was left out that he wrote them.
 3             But the second thing is you'll hear from a  4   guy who has never testified before and has nothing
 5   to do with lawsuits that when he writes CHF, it is
 6   obvious to the other doctors looking at this it is
 7   rightsided heart failure.  Then you'll hear from Dr.
 8   Yount that it is obvious it means leftsided heart
 9   failure.  Something is wrong.
10             Mr. Geise told you it wasn't exactly right
11   how I described the greater weight of the evidence.
12   That is why I showed it to you.  So we would be
13   exactly right, this is no room for imprecision on
14   the burden.  The greater weight of the evidence
15   means the more persuasive and convincing force and
16   effect of the entire evidence in the case.
17             The greater weight, the scale measures
18   weights.  We start out even.  And you look to which
19   side, after you weigh all the evidence, has the
20   greater weight, more than the other side.  Greater,
21   more than.  And everything you heard from all the
22   defense people, it is all evidence, and you assign
23   whatever weight you want.  But when you measure it,
24   it doesn't matter if it is high like this and there
25   is no doubt, or there is plenty of doubts, you look

 1   to which story you heard, which answer is more
 2   likely.
 3             If somebody says there is no proof, like
 4   Connie was embarrassed to admit that Matt told her
 5   about the dangers of smoking -- If somebody, when
 6   you're deliberating, says there is no proof.
 7   Everything you heard is proof.  This is proof.  The
 8   question is what is the greater weight of the
 9   evidence.  All of the treaters, all of the medical
10   records, or four paid opinion witnesses, only one of
11   whom said you need a pulmonary function test to
12   diagnose COPD.
13             You were shown this, the quitting methods
14   not used.  I'm not going to go through this again
15   because I think you remember exactly why each of
16   these wasn't used.  But it doesn't seem right to me
17   to say he didn't quit hard enough, he didn't try
18   hard enough, while the whole time they were
19   whispering in his ear you don't have to quit today.
20   There is no proof, and if there is ever any proof
21   anything is wrong we will take it out.  If you are
22   worried about it, just switch to filters, you don't
23   have to quit today.  Tomorrow see what happens, the
24   jury will be back, the jury will be in.  The jury
25   never came in, not until 2000.  So while they're

 1   whispering in his ear you don't have to quit today,
 2   which to someone who is an addict of any kind
 3   including a nicotine addict, it sounds a little
 4   different.  You don't have to quit today.
 5             Let me show you a couple of those.  6             Can we see 952E, please?
 7             Tens of thousands of doctors in all
 8   branches of medicine in all parts of the country
 9   were asked that question, what cigarette do you
10   smoke, Doctor?  The brand named most was Camel.
11   Yes, survey shows more doctors smoke Camels than any
12   other cigarette.  Smoke Camel, the cigarette so many
13   doctors enjoy.
14             887, please.
15             This is Timothy V. Hartnett, former
16   president of a major tobacco firm and chairman of
17   the Industry Research Committee.  Mr. Mauro, I would
18   like to quote from a statement released at the time
19   The Tobacco Institute Research Committee was formed.
20   At that time we stated, we accept an interest in
21   people's health as a basic responsibility paramount
22   to every other consideration in our business, and
23   that is where we stand today.
24             235.
25             "Question:  Suppose the tremendous amount

 1   of research now going on including that of The
 2   Tobacco Industry Research Committee were to reveal
 3   there is a cancer causing agent in cigarettes.  What
 4   then?
 5             "Answer:  Well, if it was found by
 6   somebody working under The Tobacco Industry Research
 7   Grant, it would be made public immediately, and just
 8   as broadly as we could make it, and then efforts
 9   would be taken to attempt to remove that substance
10   or substances.
11             There are other videos that you'll have
12   the capability if you want to watch any of them.
13   But if you remember the governors coming out and
14   saying the various states when the surgeon general
15   reports came out, if there is anything found wrong
16   with cigarettes, they will just take it out.
17             More importantly, all those things he said
18   he didn't do to quit, they are not on the verdict
19   form.  You see, whether he could have quit or
20   whether he tried hard enough to quit or how much he
21   wanted to quit, that is not on the verdict form.
22   The only question was whether he was addicted.
23             Mr. Geise said he is not big for labels.
24   What does addiction mean?  The real question is
25   whether he could quit.  The real question is on the

 1   verdict form.  That's the one you have to answer.
 2   If somebody is saying I think he could have quit,
 3   that is not an issue for you today.  Just talk very
 4   briefly about Dr. Yount who you heard from today and
 5   Mr. Geise discussed.
 6             He told you the leftsided heart failure he
 7   talked about, there is two parts of leftsided heart  8   failure, systolic and diastolic.
 9             When you look at the systolic
10   measurements, the function systolically of his heart
11   in his entire life, five of the seven
12   echocardiograms done showed no systolic dysfunction.
13   He admitted that.  And in the last year of his life,
14   completely normal.  So that one side of the coin,
15   completely normal.
16             The other side, diastolic, less than one
17   month before he died, yes, there was a problem,
18   which his treating doctors diagnosed and discussed
19   at length in their depositions.  And the
20   cardiologist on the report says early grade one, not
21   grade two, three, four, not endstage fatal like his
22   COPD was, endstage, and Dr. Yount admitted that.
23   Not just that it said early grade one, but he
24   admitted that when he looked at the echo it was
25   grade one.

 1             I didn't realize it until he testified
 2   today.  I thought I was going to tell you that
 3   congestive heart failure, there has got to be a
 4   reason for it, and they don't have one.  They are
 5   just picking congestive heart failure and saying he
 6   had it.  But congestive heart failure has to be
 7   caused by something.  It is a syndrome.  But they do
 8   have an answer for that.
 9             If you remember from opening and then
10   listen to Dr. Yount today, Mr. Geise said in opening
11   that just before he was hospitalized, Matthew
12   Buonomo was hospitalized for the first time and
13   diagnosed with COPD in 1995, had gone to the doctor,
14   he had been feeling ill for a few weeks, maybe
15   months, maybe up to two months, short of breath, he
16   went to the doctor, and was prescribed Verapamil.
17   Verapamil is contraindicated.  He said I didn't know
18   what contraindicated means when I started this case.
19   He said he was prescribed Verapamil.  If you have
20   congestive heart failure, it is going to exacerbate
21   it and the Verapamil sent him into the hospital.
22   Then Dr. Yount said today he was on Verapamil for
23   the rest of his life.
24             So they are not just saying he didn't have
25   COPD.  They are saying he had congestive heart

 1   failure caused by a medication prescribed by his
 2   doctors.  That is the cause, and there has to be a
 3   cause.  So not only did they treat him for the wrong
 4   disease supposedly for 13 years, they gave him the
 5   medication that ended up killing him.
 6             He never called himself addicted.  Mr.
 7   Geise said he never called himself addicted.  I'm
 8   sure if they said no one remembers him saying that,
 9   what does that have to do with anything.  He didn't 10   know what addiction was.  Connie didn't understand
11   it until she saw Dr. Henningfield's deposition.  But
12   more importantly, we can't ask him.  His mother
13   lived to 95, almost two-decade longer than him.  We
14   can't ask him if he thought he was addicted because
15   he died from COPD caused by smoking cigarettes
16   almost two decades before his mother.
17             Mr. Geise said Dr. Cummings combed his
18   archives for the most inflammatory videos he could
19   find.  You have not seen any evidence yet of what
20   they did.
21             MR. GEISE:  Objection, Your Honor.
22             THE COURT:  Overruled.
23             MR. UUSTAL:  There was some suggestion it
24   couldn't have been COPD because there were some
25   findings you were shown in the medical record that

 1   showed that on some occasions he was better than on
 2   other occasions.
 3             Dr. Klotz, who is again their
 4   pulmonologist, not a treating doctor but someone
 5   hired for litigation, was asked do you agree that
 6   COPD is with you all the time even when you don't
 7   have symptoms.
 8             And remember everyone agrees the damage to
 9   the lungs from emphysema is irreversible.  But you
10   get treated.  They have various types of treatment
11   including medication, Spiriva, which is a new
12   medication during one part of his treatment when he
13   came out specifically for COPD, it did wonders for
14   him for awhile.  But, yes, Dr. Klotz agreed, if you
15   have the disease, it is always with you, even if you
16   don't have symptoms.  Sometimes you have them,
17   sometimes you don't.  So, yes, sometimes in there he
18   is better than other times.
19             Dr. Silver was one of the doctors who
20   wrote in there that sometimes no respiratory
21   distress and things like that.
22             Can we see Dr. Silver 225?
23             "Question:  When Matthew Buonomo comes and
24   says he feels better, does he still have emphysema?
25             "Answer:  All the time.

 1             "Question:  Is shortness of breath a
 2   routine for him?
 3             "Answer:  That's just a baseline for him.
 4   A good day for him might be I'm not as short of
 5   breath today, but I'm always short of breath.  Today
 6   might be a good day.  Tomorrow might be a bad day.
 7   Someone sneezes and gets a cold, that might be an
 8   awful day.  To him a good day might be I'm able to
 9   walk across the room and I'm not gasping for air.
10             There apparently was no pulmonary function
11   test.  You remember Dr. Silver said I don't know if 12   there was a pulmonary function test.  You don't need
13   one to diagnose it.  But I don't know, I can't tell
14   from the record we have.  But apparently there was
15   no PFT.
16             Mr. Geise said when Dr. Bolton is not
17   acting as an expert he gives his patients pulmonary
18   function tests.  So I don't understand that.  In
19   1995, a decade, more than a decade before this
20   lawsuit, when he was treating a patient, he didn't
21   give him a pulmonary function test because in this
22   case he is an expert and he is not an expert.  He
23   wasn't paid to fly across the country and come in
24   here and tell you things he knew nothing about.  It
25   was his patient.

 1             But once again, you heard from only one
 2   witness you need a pulmonary function test, and he
 3   said the exact opposite a couple months ago, that
 4   you can diagnose COPD clinically.  He told us what
 5   that was.  Radiologically he said X-rays.  Pulmonary
 6   function test.  And he said well, I was wrong.  That
 7   is what he told you.  Couple months ago I was wrong
 8   when I said you could diagnose it that way.
 9             He was right last time.  Because every
10   single other witness you heard from agrees with
11   that.  And none of their experts other than him said
12   that.
13             The last thing I want to show you, his
14   treating doctors saw him a lot.  A lot.  They would
15   have you believe they didn't know whether he had --
16   They thought he had COPD and he didn't, so I just --
17   I don't know if any of you know what it is like for
18   someone with COPD and how big a mistake, how obvious
19   a mistake that would have to be.  Dr. Silver talked
20   about that.
21             Silver 222, please.
22             "Question:  What can a patient with severe
23   emphysema expect to go through as his or her
24   condition worsens over time?
25             "Answer:  That depends.  If someone has a

 1   mild case, some mild shortness of breath.  Simple
 2   symptoms of maybe a cough or just not feeling
 3   totally normal, fatigued at times to people all the
 4   way up to severe where walking across the room is a
 5   great deal for them.  It is a terrible, terrible
 6   condition because basically you're suffocating.  You
 7   are unable to get enough oxygen into your body.  It
 8   is a very, very terrible condition.
 9             You remember they all said he had severe
10   COPD.  The last thing he talks about is endstage
11   COPD, fatal COPD, which he was diagnosed with.
12             Silver 223.
13             "Question:  Emphysema is a condition 14   covered under the umbrella of COPD?
15             "Answer:  Yes, it is.
16             Was that 223?
17             "Question:  What do those patients go
18   through whose disease progresses to endstage COPD?
19             "Answer:  Unfortunately, it is just a
20   debilitating disease that basically ends up
21   ultimately killing them.  They go through terrible
22   bouts of shortness of breath, exacerbation, fatigue,
23   unable to do their daily living, daily activities,
24   because of severe lung dysfunction.  Basically they
25   are sort of a captive from their illness because

 1   they can't do their regular daily activities because
 2   they are too short of breath.
 3             THE COURT:  You need to conclude.
 4             MR. UUSTAL:  Thank you for your patience.
 5   Please, the questions are on the verdict form, those
 6   are the ones you need to answer.  Thank you.
