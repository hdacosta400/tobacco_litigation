CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE 
13:08:36
MR. BELASIC:  Thank you.  May it please the Court?
13:08:38
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, counsel,
13:08:40
Mrs. Burkhart.
13:08:41
On page 11 of your jury instructions -- and as you
13:08:43
heard Judge Jones say this morning, it was and still is
13:08:48
legal to manufacture cigarettes, to sell cigarettes, and
13:08:51
advertise cigarettes.
13:08:53
Now, as the Judge told you, that doesn't mean the
     4
13:08:56
 1
tobacco companies win.  But what it does mean is that this
13:08:59
 2
verdict in this case will be decided on the facts that are
13:09:02
 3
specific to Mrs. Burkhart.
13:09:03
 4
Now, you've heard their experts, and you've seen
13:09:07
 5
all the testimony about the warnings.  And so you know that
13:09:10
 6
even when Congress decided that cigarettes were dangerous,
13:09:14
 7
that cigarettes would cause premature death, Congress
13:09:18
 8
decided that they would be able to be sold.
13:09:20
 9
MR. HEIMANN:  I object.  This is the subject of
13:09:22
the order, Your Honor.  This kind of argument on the
13:09:24
legality --
13:09:24
THE COURT:  Overruled.  And I just remind the
13:09:26
jury, this is counsel's argument.
13:09:28
MR. BELASIC:  As their own experts admitted,
13:09:30
Congress decided that cigarettes could be sold even if they
13:09:34
were dangerous, even if they were addictive, as long as
13:09:36
they had the warning.  And we know that for 50 years that
13:09:41
warning's been on the pack.  And we know -- we know that
13:09:45
Mrs. Burkhart saw that warning.
13:09:46
Now, let's talk about the facts of this case.
13:09:50
When Mrs. Burkhart took the stand, one of the first very
13:09:55
direct questions I asked her is why she started smoking.
13:09:58
And she said two words:  Her mother.  And then I asked her,
13:10:02
so it wasn't anything that a tobacco company did?  And she
13:10:05
said her mother smoked.  The cigarettes were there.  And I
     5
13:10:09
 1
asked her, was it any advertising, you know, any
13:10:13
 2
advertising, let alone the false advertising that the
13:10:16
 3
plaintiff's claim?  Did that cause you to smoke?  And she
13:10:19
 4
said, no, the cigarettes were there.
13:10:21
 5
So there is no dispute here that in 1958 when a
13:10:25
 6
smart senior in high school picked up her mother's
13:10:27
 7
cigarettes, it was not because of something that a tobacco
13:10:30
 8
company had did or had done or had said.
13:10:34
 9
She chose to smoke, and her mother made the
13:10:37
cigarettes available.
13:10:40
Now, Mrs. Burkhart enjoyed smoking.  She told you
13:10:42
from the stand that she enjoyed smoking.  Later she gave
13:10:46
some different testimony.  But the eyewitness in this case,
13:10:50
the man that I told you would be the most important witness
13:10:52
in this case, the man that you didn't hear about from
13:10:56
plaintiff's counsel in opening, the man who was not called
13:10:59
in plaintiff's case, was Mr. Burkhart.
13:11:03
And you saw that Mr. Burkhart listed when
13:11:08
Mr. Isasi questioned him that his wife enjoyed smoking,
13:11:12
that it relaxed her, that she liked it in social settings,
13:11:15
that it helped relieve stress.
13:11:18
So when you were asked, why would someone smoke
13:11:20
all of these years if she knew?  Plaintiffs say, well, it's
13:11:23
a simple act.  It's a simple answer.  It's addiction.  We
13:11:27
know that she enjoyed smoking.
     6
13:11:29
 1
Now, you see on the screen in front of you that
13:11:32
 2
Mrs. Burkhart did not try to quit smoking for decades, even
13:11:34
 3
when she knew the risk.  And I'll talk about some of that
13:11:37
 4
evidence.  But it is not disputed that she saw the warning
13:11:42
 5
at a minimum in 1966.  She admitted it when I asked her.
13:11:46
 6
She made no effort to quit in 1966 or 1967 or 1968 or 1969
13:11:53
 7
or the '70s.
13:11:55
 8
So when Mr. Heimann says that she was desperately
13:11:59
 9
trying to quit, that's not what the evidence in this case
13:12:01
shows.  The evidence showed that for decades she knew the
13:12:04
risks before she made any effort.  The evidence shows that
13:12:09
she stopped briefly in the 1980s.
13:12:11
We all heard the SmokEnders evidence.  Now, her
13:12:14
husband says it was only a few days, and now he remembers
13:12:17
that, well, maybe he was in Orlando, so it could have been
13:12:20
three weeks.
13:12:20
But whether, ladies and gentlemen, whether it was
13:12:23
three days or three weeks, that is the only time she
13:12:27
stopped smoking in 36 years until 1994 when, in her own
13:12:35
words -- and you've seen their own experts agree.  You
13:12:38
heard Mrs. Burkhart say it, and you saw the videotape where
13:12:41
Mrs. Burkhart says it -- the first time she got it in her
13:12:45
head that she was going to quit, she did.
13:12:48
And whether you call it addiction or habit or
13:12:51
dependency, in her own words, when she really made up her
     7
13:12:55
 1
mind to quit, she did.  And her success rate at quitting
13:12:59
 2
was 100 percent, one attempt when she really made up her
13:13:04
 3
mind.  And then she quit.
13:13:05
 4
Now, based on that, was Mrs. Burkhart's smoking
13:13:12
 5
involuntary?  The evidence is clear that she made a huge
13:13:15
 6
variety of choices, but the evidence from plaintiff's
13:13:19
 7
experts, they admit smoking is not involuntary.
13:13:22
 8
You saw the Surgeon General reports, and I'll show
13:13:25
 9
you some of those.  Smoking is not involuntary.
13:13:28
And, of course, it isn't.  Because Mrs. Burkhart
13:13:31
had smoked for 36 years, their expert who says that she's
13:13:35
addicted under some definition says that she was at the
13:13:38
peak of her addiction.  Mrs. Burkhart says that she was at
13:13:41
the peak of her smoking, three packs a day.
13:13:44
But the first time she put her mind to it, and,
13:13:47
again, in her own words, that first time she was able to
13:13:50
quit.  It wasn't involuntary.  If she could quit a
13:13:54
36-year-old, 3-pack-a-day habit in 1994, she could have
13:13:59
quit in 1966 when she saw the warning or 1964 when she
13:14:04
heard the Surgeon General's report or 1974 when her own
13:14:07
husband said that's going to kill you.
13:14:11
There's no dispute that she had the capacity and
13:14:14
the ability to quit, because she did.
13:14:22
Now, let's look at some of the key facts.
13:14:25
Mr. Heimann said that he's not going to marshal the facts,
     8
13:14:27
 1
but he certainly talked about some of them.  I am going to
13:14:29
 2
marshal the facts.  And the reason is we've had eight days
13:14:33
 3
of facts.  You've seen many of them have been disputed.
13:14:36
 4
Many of them have been contradicted by witnesses, and many
13:14:40
 5
of them have been contradicted by the same witness.  So
13:14:43
 6
let's look at the facts that we've heard about
13:14:46
 7
Mrs. Burkhart's smoking.
13:14:48
 8
We know she started because her mother smoked.  We
13:14:52
 9
know that nothing the company said caused her to start
13:14:55
smoking.  That's admitted on the stand just two days ago.
13:14:59
We know that when she was a regular smoker, she
13:15:04
was in college.  When she started smoking as a senior in
13:15:06
high school, she didn't even inhale.  Do you remember the
13:15:10
testimony that for the six months she didn't even inhale
13:15:13
her cigarettes?
13:15:15
And I asked her, well, it was your friends who
13:15:17
taught you to inhale, right?  Not a tobacco company?  And
13:15:21
again, she agrees.  So by the time she was actually a
13:15:24
smoker, let alone a regular smoker, she was an adult.
13:15:28
She saw in the '60s from the very beginning her
13:15:32
father telling her mother that smoking was bad for her,
13:15:36
that she should quit because smoking wasn't good for her.
13:15:39
So she witnessed her own parents arguing and
13:15:45
warning about the risks of smoking.  That was in 1968.  She
13:15:50
made no effort to quit.  She smoked for another 16 years
     9
13:15:53
 1
before she even thought of quitting.
13:15:55
 2
She didn't try to quit in the 1950s.  We know
13:15:59
 3
that.  In the 1950s, we saw that the media reported the
13:16:02
 4
risks.  And I don't know what you thought of the battle of
13:16:07
 5
the sticky notes, but you know that in the 1950s, there was
13:16:11
 6
a tremendous amount of publicity, "Reader's Digest,"
13:16:14
 7
"Time," "Life" magazine, et cetera.  She made no effort to
13:16:21
 8
quit smoking in response to any of that information.
13:16:24
 9
We know she read the newspapers, and you all saw
13:16:27
those reports.  She made no effort to quit when she saw
13:16:30
them.
13:16:31
We've heard that they liked TV news, the
13:16:34
Burkharts.  We've heard that they liked to see Walter
13:16:36
Cronkite.  We've seen some of reports that were on
13:16:39
television news.  Most of those were in the '60s, some in
13:16:42
the '70s.
13:16:43
But, again, during that period, not once did
13:16:46
Mrs. Burkhart make any effort to quit.  According to her,
13:16:50
she went from 1958 all the way to 1984, 26 years, ladies
13:16:58
and gentlemen.  Despite all the warnings, despite her
13:17:01
husband saying it would kill her, despite the warning on
13:17:04
the pack for 20 years, she made no effort to quit.  She
13:17:07
stopped briefly in the '80s.  And then ten years later,
13:17:09
she made up her mind.
13:17:11
This is not the story of a desperate smoker who's
    10
13:17:15
 1
making attempt after attempt, quit effort after quit
13:17:19
 2
effort.  This is the story of a woman who quit the first
13:17:22
 3
time.  And, again, it's her own words.  We didn't need to
13:17:26
 4
have some expert witness hired by a tobacco company to come
13:17:30
 5
in and tell you why she quit and when she quit.  She did.
13:17:34
 6
She told you that from the stand.
13:17:36
 7
We know the '64 Surgeon General's report was one
13:17:42
 8
of the most widely reported public health stories of the
13:17:46
 9
century.  You saw on video when Dr. Burns admitted that.
13:17:50
1964, she made no effort to quit.  She would not even think
13:17:53
of quitting for 20 years later despite a warning that it
13:17:57
could cause a deadly disease, lung cancer.
13:17:59
And then in '66, the first pack warning came on.
13:18:06
I asked her, you saw that warning?  She said she did.  Made
13:18:09
no effort.  It didn't change her ability.  Now, Mr. Heimann
13:18:13
asserted, well, if she had only known that it could cause
13:18:18
disease, if she had only known that it was addictive, she
13:18:21
wouldn't have smoked or she wouldn't have quit.
13:18:23
But we know what she did when she was given direct
13:18:27
and explicit information.  We know what she did.  And when
13:18:31
the warning was on every single pack, she made no effort to
13:18:35
quit.  That was her right.  No one's blaming her.  But that
13:18:40
was her right.  And you'll assess her responsibility for
13:18:44
making that decision.
13:18:46
She told me that in the 1960s, 1960s -- this
    11
13:18:50
 1
is 20 years before she makes any effort to quit -- that she
13:18:54
 2
was calling her smoking a nicotine fit.  She knew what
13:18:57
 3
nicotine was.  She knew it was in her cigarettes.  She was
13:19:01
 4
expressing the fact that she thought she was smoking for
13:19:04
 5
nicotine.
13:19:04
 6
I asked her if she believed she was addicted at
13:19:10
 7
the time in the mid to late 1960s.  And she agreed.  Now,
13:19:15
 8
Mr. Heimann says, well, there was a concealment.  No one
13:19:17
 9
knew that smoking was addictive.  The tobacco companies had
13:19:20
a sentence in a document.  Out of 60 million pages, they
13:19:25
had a sentence in a document that said the word addiction.
13:19:28
How could she have known?
13:19:31
She told you from the stand.  I didn't need to pay
13:19:33
$4 million for an expert to come in or a man who has
13:19:38
been -- or a man who testifies for a living.  She told you
13:19:41
that.  In the 1960s, she thought she smoked for nicotine.
13:19:45
She described herself as addicted.
13:19:47
So what did she do in the 1960s when she knew and
13:19:51
believed that?  She chose to smoke.  She made no effort to
13:19:55
quit in the 1960s, made no effort to quit in the 1970s.
13:20:00
Now, all of us look back on decisions in our lives
13:20:03
with hindsight.  And obviously, most of the events that
13:20:06
have occurred that we've discussed in this case are in the
13:20:10
past.  So it's only natural to look back and say, well,
13:20:13
what should I have done or what would I have done?
    12
13:20:17
 1
But we know when she heard about addiction, when
13:20:22
 2
she heard about lung cancer, when she heard her own husband
13:20:25
 3
say it's going to kill you, she didn't try to quit.
13:20:28
 4
And so the idea that if R.J. Reynolds had put up a
13:20:32
 5
paragraph in the "New York Times" and said all of that
13:20:39
 6
statistical evidence we've been disputing, we now think
13:20:43
 7
it's true, the idea that she would have quit the next day,
13:20:46
 8
ladies and gentlemen, that's not borne out by her own
13:20:49
 9
testimony.
13:20:49
You know, they brought in a witness who's almost
13:20:52
made $4 million, Dr. Burns.  And, you know, he put on his
13:20:58
thinking cap.  He said, I think she was influenced.  I
13:21:02
think she relied.
13:21:03
He didn't even talk to her.  He doesn't even know
13:21:05
her.  He didn't even have all of the depositions.
13:21:07
We know what she said from the stand.  And for
13:21:09
those 20 years, she was being warned over and over again.
13:21:13
She didn't try to quit.  So the idea that a little more
13:21:17
information or a sentence out of a document from a tobacco
13:21:21
company would have caused her to quit, even her own
13:21:26
testimony didn't support that, ladies and gentlemen.
13:21:27
We just saw the 1970 warning.  She said she saw
13:21:36
that warning.  She made no effort to quit in the 1970s.
13:21:40
But what we heard from Mr. Burkhart is that they
13:21:42
would have conversations.  And on this conversation,
    13
13:21:46
 1
Mr. Isasi specifically asked him -- and he specifically
13:21:49
 2
agreed -- that these kind of conversations started around
13:21:53
 3
the very first time they met in that first year, 1974 and
13:21:58
 4
1975.
13:22:01
 5
Now, when the man you love most and trust most
13:22:05
 6
says you're doing something that will kill you, that is a
13:22:07
 7
warning that is more direct, ladies and gentlemen, than a
13:22:11
 8
"Time" magazine or the warning on the pack.  And it is not
13:22:14
 9
disputed in this case.
13:22:16
And her response was not to try to quit.  It was
13:22:20
not to ask a doctor for help.  Her response was to say,
13:22:23
it's my life.  And she was right because she gets to make
13:22:27
the decisions.
13:22:30
But in hindsight, she now looks back and says, I
13:22:33
made the wrong decision.  I could quit, but I quit later.
13:22:39
And now we know that she wants 10 to $15 million for that
13:22:43
decision.
13:22:49
I asked Mrs. Burkhart if she had seen the 1985
13:22:54
warning.  And that's important because it says emphysema
13:22:56
right on it.  And she continued to smoke.  Even though the
13:22:59
packs of cigarettes that were in her hand, the packs of
13:23:02
cigarettes that were in her purse, the packs of cigarettes
13:23:06
that were on her table said, smoking causes emphysema.
13:23:10
Now, she told me that she had seen the warnings
13:23:13
all the way back to 1966.  But when it came to the
    14
13:23:16
 1
emphysema warning, she said, I had bifocals.  I didn't read
13:23:21
 2
the warning.
13:23:22
 3
And I asked her, you weren't even looking for the
13:23:24
 4
warning?
13:23:25
 5
No.
13:23:25
 6
So her story is that because she wears bifocals,
13:23:30
 7
even though she read the newspaper every day with those
13:23:33
 8
same bifocals, the print much smaller in the newspaper, she
13:23:38
 9
said she never saw the warning.
13:23:39
You have to judge the credibility, the financial
13:23:42
interest, and all the other factors that Judge Jones has
13:23:45
told you about when you evaluate every witness; and not
13:23:48
just evaluating a tobacco company witness, but you have to
13:23:52
evaluate the credibility of Mr. and Mrs. Burkhart and what
13:23:56
they said under oath.
13:23:58
So she admits she was warned on the pack it could
13:24:01
cause emphysema, but she didn't see it.  You'll hear later,
13:24:07
her husband said she did, and they talked about it.
13:24:10
Well, her husband says when he would tell her it
13:24:15
would kill her, she said, yeah, I know that.  She herself
13:24:18
said, one of these days, these things are probably going to
13:24:21
kill us.
13:24:22
Her husband says in the first year he met her, '74
13:24:25
and '75, she'd light up and he would call it a coffin nail.
13:24:30
She'd light up and he'd call it a cancer stick.  Did she
    15
13:24:34
 1
try to quit in '74 and '75?  No.  Did she try to quit at
13:24:39
 2
all in the 1970s?
13:24:40
 3
Now, those warnings coming from the man you love
13:24:43
 4
most are far more direct than a pack warning.  And so we
13:24:47
 5
know what she would do.  We know that if she got a little
13:24:51
 6
more information she wasn't going to quit.
13:24:54
 7
And Mrs. Burkhart said, frankly, it's a personal
13:24:57
 8
decision.  We heard she wouldn't warn her own sister to
13:25:00
 9
stop smoking because she said it's a personal thing.  The
13:25:04
smoker has to make the decision.  And she did.
13:25:10
We know she saw public service announcements.  One
13:25:14
ran in 1985.  The ashtray ad ran in 1967.
13:25:20
And finally, we know what Mr. Burkhart said that
13:25:23
he had -- they had verbal fights about smoking.  And when
13:25:26
they'd get mad, they'd be blunt and direct:
13:25:29
You're going to kill yourself.
13:25:30
It's my life.
13:25:31
You're going to kill yourself.
13:25:33
It's my decision.
13:25:34
No warning.  No warning could be more explicit and
13:25:38
more personal and more direct than that.  But she decided
13:25:42
to not try to quit.  She quit once in the '80s for a few
13:25:47
days or a few weeks.
13:25:52
We heard from her husband that when she talked to
13:25:55
her cousins, in her own words, she would say, I've got to
    16
13:25:58
 1
quit these damn things or they're going to kill me.
13:26:11
 2
Ladies and gentlemen, that is an incredible amount
13:26:12
 3
of evidence of the sheer amount of information and warning,
13:26:18
 4
not something in a dry, scientific textbook.  But she knew.
13:26:22
 5
She was warned about the risks.  She chose to continue.
13:26:25
 6
It's a decision we all make when we decide whether
13:26:28
 7
to exercise, eat, drink, et cetera.  Things affect our
13:26:33
 8
health.
13:26:34
 9
She made that decision, and she did it knowing
13:26:38
"it's going to kill you."  Nothing could be more direct.
13:26:42
Now, we asked her -- and I asked her directly
13:26:47
right in the last five minutes of the cross-examination,
13:26:52
and I asked her specifically -- isn't it true that the only
13:26:56
time you heard the tobacco companies -- she didn't know who
13:27:00
they were -- but some tobacco source say it wasn't proven
13:27:05
was after 1984?  And she said she wasn't certain and that
13:27:09
she said she didn't think so.
13:27:11
And you saw I played the video.  Couldn't have
13:27:13
been more direct.  Isn't it true that the only time you
13:27:17
heard a tobacco company say it wasn't proven was after
13:27:22
1984?  And on the videotape, under sworn oath, she said,
13:27:26
that's true.  And then she explained why she knows that.
13:27:30
She says she went to SmokEnders in 1984.  And you
13:27:34
saw on the videotape that she said under oath that she
13:27:37
never heard a tobacco company or some unidentified tobacco
    17
13:27:41
 1
source say it's not proven until after 1984.
13:27:46
 2
And we know what her response was.  She told me,
13:27:50
 3
who do they think they're kidding?  Who do they think
13:27:53
 4
they're kidding?
13:27:55
 5
She didn't believe the very statements that the
13:27:59
 6
plaintiff's lawyer has relied upon to build this case.  I
13:28:05
 7
didn't need to bring in a doctor who's never met
13:28:09
 8
Mrs. Burkhart to guess what she might have thought 20 or 30
13:28:12
 9
years ago.
13:28:13
Our witness, the defense witness, is
13:28:17
Mrs. Burkhart.  And literally, our witness, the defense
13:28:20
witness, is Mr. Burkhart.  You saw what they said.
13:28:27
The last thing that Mrs. Burkhart told me when I
13:28:31
decided to stop was, I didn't believe them at all.  And she
13:28:35
talked about she didn't believe that it wasn't proven, but
13:28:39
she also said the idea that there was going to be benefits
13:28:43
from filters, the idea that there was going to be benefits
13:28:46
from lights.  And she said, I don't believe them all.  Who
13:28:50
are they kidding?
13:28:52
Now, Mr. Heimann says, oh, no, no.  That's not
13:28:54
what she meant.  You've heard the testimony.  It was just
13:28:57
two days ago.  She was on the stand for only 45 minutes on
13:29:03
cross-examination.  And you saw that testimony.
13:29:05
That's why I stopped, because the woman who is
13:29:08
suing for $15 million says that by the '80s, she didn't
    18
13:29:12
 1
believe any claim.  She had never heard it said not proven
13:29:18
 2
before that.  And she didn't believe any claim that lights
13:29:21
 3
or filters were better.
13:29:22
 4
That's why I stopped, because that's her
13:29:24
 5
testimony.
13:29:24
 6
Now, we're not retrying the Engle lawsuit, ladies
13:29:30
 7
and gentlemen.  But you wouldn't know it.  Because
13:29:32
 8
Mr. Heimann constantly is talking about issues that were
13:29:35
 9
already decided.
13:29:37
You're not going to decide if the tobacco
13:29:40
companies did something wrong or if they concealed
13:29:42
information.  We're not retrying that.
13:29:45
And when you see the verdict form, every question
13:29:46
on the verdict form is about Mrs. Burkhart.  It's not about
13:29:52
R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris or Lorillard.  It's about
13:29:55
Mrs. Burkhart.
13:29:56
We presented the key witnesses.  Mrs. Burkhart's
13:30:00
cross-examination, Mr. Burkhart.  That's what we know.  And
13:30:04
that's why this case is about Mrs. Burkhart.
13:30:12
Miss Gallagher is going to talk a little about
13:30:14
this issue later, but I want to highlight for you that
13:30:16
obviously Mr. and Mrs. Burkhart contradicted each other.
13:30:20
There were a whole variety of issues where their testimony
13:30:23
simply didn't sync up.
13:30:26
But what I want to also note, and I'm sure you
    19
13:30:28
 1
remember a whole variety of incidents, is that they
13:30:31
 2
contradicted themselves.  Repeatedly, over and over again,
13:30:36
 3
a direct and simple question produced an answer that, now
13:30:41
 4
you know, was different than what they said under oath
13:30:44
 5
before trial.
13:30:47
 6
You saw us play videotape after videotape of what
13:30:50
 7
they said under oath.  They contradicted each other.
13:30:53
 8
Plaintiff has the burden of proof.  And you'll
13:30:59
 9
have to decide what the credibility of witnesses who
13:31:02
disagree with each other and who contradict themselves mean
13:31:07
as far as whether Mrs. Burkhart has established her burden
13:31:11
of proof.
13:31:12
Now, the plaintiff's experts we know are paid
13:31:15
millions.  Millions.  I think the one that was paid the
13:31:19
least might have been Dr. Cummings, who said he's only made
13:31:23
1.3 or only $1.5 million doing this, he admits, for a
13:31:29
living.
13:31:30
They never talked to Mrs. Burkhart, even though
13:31:32
they said she was addicted.  They never picked up the phone
13:31:36
and talked to her.  And you saw when I cross-examined them,
13:31:40
and you saw on the videotape, that they would ignore her
13:31:44
own testimony.
13:31:45
When I had asked Dr. Cummings, isn't this what she
13:31:49
said under oath?  He would say, I don't remember that.
13:31:52
Dr. Burns told me on the video, well, that's not
    20
13:31:55
 1
in my notes.
13:31:55
 2
And then we learned that it was the plaintiff's
13:31:58
 3
lawyers who gave only part of the deposition to Dr. Burns.
13:32:01
 4
He didn't even have the whole facts, ladies and gentlemen.
13:32:04
 5
Didn't even have the whole facts.  And he laughed when I
13:32:07
 6
asked him, he said, well, obviously, Mr. Belasic, I don't
13:32:11
 7
know what I don't know.  I don't know what I didn't read.
13:32:14
 8
But that's the whole point, ladies and gentlemen.
13:32:16
 9
Don't bring in someone who has made millions of dollars,
13:32:19
who's never even talked to the plaintiff, who's never even
13:32:23
read the full testimony of the person who now wants $15
13:32:26
million.  That's not fair.  You'll decide what the
13:32:30
credibility of witnesses who ignore the testimony of the
13:32:33
people who actually were there.
13:32:36
Dr. Cummings talked about advertising.  I asked
13:32:42
him one simple question:  Did you actually show the jury a
13:32:46
single advertisement for a brand that Mrs. Burkhart smoked?
13:32:49
And he said no.
13:32:52
He's made a million dollars testifying.  He's
13:32:54
testified at 20 trials.  But he couldn't put in the time to
13:32:58
even find a single advertisement that Mrs. Burkhart ever
13:33:01
saw.  We're not retrying Engle.  His testimony had nothing
13:33:06
to do with Mrs. Burkhart or her response to advertising.
13:33:09
And when I asked him, well, wait a second, didn't
13:33:12
her husband tell her it was going to kill her?  And she
    21
13:33:16
 1
said, it's my life and I'm going to smoke any way?
13:33:19
 2
He said he doesn't remember that.  Doesn't
13:33:22
 3
remember that.  Not in his notes.
13:33:26
 4
Someone that's been paid $1.5 million and doesn't
13:33:29
 5
remember the sworn testimony that you saw, that you know
13:33:33
 6
exists, you decide why someone would do that.  Why would an
13:33:37
 7
expert not know the basic facts, and at the same time be
13:33:41
 8
picking up 10 or $20,000 a case for the last four years.
13:33:45
 9
Now, Dr. Proctor has obviously been paid a lot of
13:33:51
money, the historian.  He admitted right off the bat, he
13:33:55
was very open about it, he didn't know anything about the
13:33:58
Burkharts.  He was just there to talk about history.
13:34:01
He didn't say that there was anything that was
13:34:02
done to a cigarette that Mrs. Burkhart actually smoked.  He
13:34:07
didn't show any advertisement that she actually saw.  He
13:34:12
doesn't know what she smoked.  He barely even said the name
13:34:16
Mrs. Burkhart.
13:34:19
Now, we presume that he knew this was a case
13:34:22
called Burkhart, but he presented no testimony that would
13:34:24
be relevant to her.
13:34:26
And you have to ask yourself why he was even
13:34:29
there.  Because the issues of what the tobacco companies
13:34:33
did or the questions that Judge Jones talked about, those
13:34:36
were decided.  This was the case, this was the chance, this
13:34:41
was the obligation of the plaintiffs to present the proof
    22
13:34:45
 1
from Mrs. Burkhart.
13:34:47
 2
And Dr. Proctor didn't know a darn thing about
13:34:49
 3
her.
13:34:53
 4
Now, Dr. Burns, obviously very distinguished in
13:34:56
 5
terms of writing articles, writing portions of Surgeon
13:34:59
 6
General's reports.  He's been paid almost $4 million.  Made
13:35:03
 7
almost half a million last year.
13:35:07
 8
But he never met her.  He never talked to her.
13:35:10
 9
And he admitted the lawyers picked out parts of the
13:35:13
depositions.  Parts.
13:35:16
And so you saw -- and it got a little testy
13:35:19
between me and Dr. Burns, because he would tell me, well, I
13:35:22
don't have it.  Why don't you show it to me?
13:35:24
Well, that was a trial testimony, ladies and
13:35:26
gentlemen.  The time for homework was over.  Dr. Burns
13:35:30
admits he didn't have all the information.  You do.  You
13:35:33
actually know more than their expert.  You know more than a
13:35:37
man who writes articles for a living.
13:35:41
And I say that because he told us that from 1990
13:35:45
on, from 1990 through 2007, he spent 95 percent of his time
13:35:52
researching, writing, and testifying in litigation for
13:35:56
lawyers who sue tobacco companies.
13:35:59
He spent 5 percent of his time on patients.  Think
13:36:03
about what that means.  The man that they brought in to
13:36:06
talk about when Mrs. Burkhart had COPD, or when she had her
    23
13:36:12
 1
symptoms -- he's been retired for the last seven or eight
13:36:17
 2
years -- and going all the way back to '90, a quarter of a
13:36:20
 3
century, he spent only a tiny fraction of his time actually
13:36:24
 4
seeing doctors (sic.)
13:36:27
 5
That's why we brought in Dr. Cosmo, somebody who
13:36:30
 6
sees 800 patients a month, somebody who has been practicing
13:36:34
 7
in the real world of real pulmonology, with thousands of
13:36:37
 8
patients over and over again for the last 28 years.
13:36:40
 9
They brought you somebody that writes articles.
13:36:48
One of the things that Mr. Heimann said -- and
13:36:53
you'll have to decide if there's any evidence in the
13:36:56
record -- is, again, this speculation, wow, if they had
13:37:01
opened their files, she wouldn't have smoked.
13:37:03
And we talked about what she knew, but let's just
13:37:06
quickly review.  These types of warnings -- and you have to
13:37:10
decide, is a warning of death enough to motivate someone?
13:37:14
Because if it is, then we know that Mrs. Burkhart was
13:37:21
warned.  Then we know that Mrs. Burkhart did not rely on a
13:37:25
tobacco company saying or not saying something.
13:37:27
She wasn't fooled.  Bottom line, she wasn't
13:37:29
fooled.
13:37:30
Her husband tells her, here's another nail in your
13:37:34
coffin.  Here's a cancer stick.  He says it could kill you.
13:37:37
And she says, I know.  These conversations all
13:37:41
happen in the 1970s.  She says, it's my life.  She says, I
    24
13:37:45
 1
know that.
13:37:48
 2
Mr. Burkhart, he said they got mad at each other.
13:37:51
 3
She was mad at his drinking.  He was mad at her smoking.
13:37:55
 4
And you heard Mr. Burkhart say, in his own words, it was
13:37:59
 5
tit for tat.  So he'd say, you're killing yourself.  And
13:38:02
 6
she'd say, it's my life.
13:38:04
 7
Well, now, 40 years later -- was the mid-'70s.
13:38:13
 8
Forty years later, Mrs. Burkhart is saying that she knew
13:38:16
 9
but she made the wrong decision.  And now her lawyer says
13:38:20
that she should be paid $15 million for that decision.
13:38:24
What we did hear is that in 1994, Mr. Burkhart
13:38:30
quit drinking.  And then a few months later, Mrs. Burkhart
13:38:36
quit smoking.  Tit for tat.
13:38:39
During the time that Mrs. Burkhart knew the risks
13:38:46
and made no effort to quit, the 1960s, millions of people
13:38:50
across the country, people that were smoking as much as
13:38:55
her, smoking more than her, smoking the same type of
13:38:57
cigarettes, people who would be considered addicted under
13:38:59
the plaintiff's own definitions -- Dr. Cummings agreed,
13:39:03
Dr. Burns agreed, Dr. Proctor agreed -- millions were
13:39:08
quitting.
13:39:09
Ten years after the Surgeon General's report, 30
13:39:11
million Americans quit.  Mrs. Burkhart did not try to quit.
13:39:16
And, again, this isn't a question of blame.  She's
13:39:19
in here suing, saying that her decisions were somehow
    25
13:39:23
 1
influenced, that she was somehow tricked.  This isn't
13:39:26
 2
blame.  It's an assessment of responsibility.
13:39:32
 3
No one, no one could decide for her when to try to
13:39:35
 4
quit, when to quit.  She says herself she wouldn't even
13:39:38
 5
warn her sister.  Didn't warn her husband.  It's a personal
13:39:41
 6
thing, she said.
13:39:42
 7
No one else could control her smoking.
13:39:44
 8
So 30 million people were quitting around her, of
13:39:47
 9
every shape, size, and stripe of smoker.  She did not even
13:39:51
try.  Now she wants $15 million for smoking a legal product
13:39:56
with the knowledge that it could kill her.
13:40:00
We heard that in the first four years of the
13:40:03
warnings, 13 million people quit.  She did not even try.
13:40:11
When Mr. Heimann talks about her -- that she's a
13:40:14
desperate smoker, we all know and we've heard the evidence
13:40:18
of Mrs. Burkhart's situation.  But what Mr. Heimann was
13:40:23
arguing was different.  He said that when she was smoking,
13:40:27
and even during the times she was perfectly healthy, that
13:40:30
she was a desperate smoker.
13:40:31
Well, is that really true?  Putting aside
13:40:35
everyone's natural sympathy for the situation that
13:40:39
Mrs. Burkhart is in now, think about the objective
13:40:42
evidence, even from Mrs. Burkhart herself, of what it was
13:40:46
like in the '60s, '70s, and '80s.
13:40:49
If you give her credit for quitting for three
    26
13:40:51
 1
weeks in 1984 -- her husband says it's a few days.  He
13:40:55
 2
says, well, I was on construction duty, so I couldn't see
13:40:58
 3
it.
13:41:00
 4
Okay.  Let's say she quit for three weeks in 1984.
13:41:03
 5
By her own testimony, she never ever, ever stopped smoking
13:41:07
 6
again until '94.  And then she quit for good.
13:41:11
 7
She said, well, Great American Smokeout, but she
13:41:14
 8
didn't stop.  She said her doctor gave her patches.  She
13:41:17
 9
kept on smoking.  So we know she wasn't smoking for
13:41:20
nicotine.  She was getting nicotine through the patch.  She
13:41:22
smoked anyway.
13:41:24
So the only time that she stopped smoking between
13:41:27
1958 and 1994 was for those three weeks.
13:41:33
Now, Mr. Heimann liked to talk about analogies to
13:41:37
car accidents.  Well, let's talk about real life people who
13:41:40
try to change their health.
13:41:43
If you hear a friend say, I've been seriously
13:41:47
trying to exercise.  I've made a real commitment to change
13:41:50
my life.
13:41:51
And we then find out that that person exercised --
13:41:54
let's say they went on a treadmill -- for three weeks out
13:41:58
of 36 years.  No rational person would say, that's right.
13:42:03
You really were making a commitment.  You were really
13:42:06
trying.
13:42:07
But that's what Mrs. Burkhart told us, that for
    27
13:42:12
 1
three weeks she stopped.  For three weeks she made an
13:42:16
 2
effort.
13:42:17
 3
And she says in her own mind that wasn't really
13:42:20
 4
the time that she made up her mind she was going to quit.
13:42:24
 5
No one, no one would say that a person that goes on a diet
13:42:28
 6
for a day and then takes the next decade off, or someone
13:42:33
 7
that goes to look for a job for a day and then doesn't look
13:42:36
 8
for a job for ten years, no one would say that those are
13:42:39
 9
desperate or serious attempts to change their life.
13:42:43
But the facts for Mrs. Burkhart herself are that
13:42:47
from 1958 to 1984, a quarter of a century, she made no
13:42:52
effort to quit.
13:42:54
So this isn't a case of a desperate smoker.  It's
13:42:58
the case of a smoker who quit for three weeks in the 1980s
13:43:03
and then continued to smoke.  And then quit the first time
13:43:06
she was going to put her mind to it.
13:43:08
That's not a $15 million case, ladies and
13:43:12
gentlemen.
13:43:12
Her own words, she says until you get it into your
13:43:18
head that you're going to quit, you're just not going to
13:43:20
quit.
13:43:22
And then we asked her bluntly --
13:43:28
I think the -- testing.  All right.
13:43:30
THE COURT:  Very good.
13:44:10
Appreciate your patience for just a moment,
    28
13:44:12
 1
please.
13:44:19
 2
MR. BELASIC:  All right.  We know that she said
13:44:23
 3
she quit the first time that she got it in her head that
13:44:27
 4
she was going to quit.  And so I asked her directly, and
13:44:31
 5
she said, well, she thought, on the stand, no, she thought
13:44:35
 6
she did think it before.
13:44:37
 7
And so you saw that I had to play the videotape of
13:44:39
 8
her sworn testimony just five months ago in December.  And
13:44:44
 9
what she said was, it was the first time that she got it in
13:44:47
her head she was going to quit, was 1994.
13:44:50
And then she said something extremely important.
13:44:53
She said in her own words, I wish I had done that in 1984,
13:44:58
but I didn't.
13:45:03
It's absolutely understandable that she wishes
13:45:06
that.  We all have sympathy for the situation that
13:45:10
Mrs. Burkhart is in now.
13:45:11
But by her own testimony, in 1984, she didn't do
13:45:15
that.  In 1984, she didn't make up her mind to quit
13:45:20
smoking.
13:45:22
Now, if there's any evidence that had she quit
13:45:26
then, she would have avoided her injury -- and apparently
13:45:33
Mr. Heimann agrees that there is such evidence -- that's
13:45:36
very important.
13:45:36
But what it means, ladies and gentlemen, is that
13:45:38
she had the ability to quit and that she herself
    29
13:45:40
 1
acknowledges she hadn't made the kind of effort ever before
13:45:44
 2
until 1994.
13:45:45
 3
And what it means is that she's asking for 
13:45:48
 4
$15 million, maybe only $10 million according to
13:45:53
 5
Mr. Heimann, for that decision.
13:45:54
 6
Regret and hindsight is absolutely understandable.
13:45:58
 7
But it's not the substitute for proof that Judge Jones has
13:46:02
 8
told you he requires.
13:46:04
 9
Now, their own experts agreed.  Dr. Cummings, I
13:46:11
had to play the video, said anyone can quit if they make up
13:46:14
their mind to do it.
13:46:16
Shook his head, oh, no, no, no, Mr. Belasic.  We
13:46:19
had to roll the video where he said exactly that.
13:46:22
Dr. Cummings, the success rate for people who
13:46:23
really want to quit and stick to it is 100 percent.  Again,
13:46:27
he denied he said it.  He denied he meant it.  I had to
13:46:32
roll the video.  He said, plain as day, in his own
13:46:34
literature, he says the success rate for the truly
13:46:37
motivated is 100 percent.
13:46:38
And that's what it was for Mrs. Burkhart.  First
13:46:42
time she got it in her head, first time she made her mind
13:46:45
up, she quit.  And she never, ever relapsed.
13:46:51
Now, we know that 60 million people have quit.
13:46:55
What's important about that is that all of this argument
13:46:59
and all of the evidence, all of the claims that, well,
    30
13:47:03
 1
cigarettes change your brain, they trigger dopamine, which
13:47:08
 2
Dr. Cummings admitted is triggered by any number of things,
13:47:12
 3
anything from watching an exciting game, to kissing and
13:47:15
 4
hugging, to food, to water, to sunshine.
13:47:17
 5
All of those 60 million people had brains.  They
13:47:21
 6
had dopamine.  They had serotonin.  All of them had
13:47:25
 7
receptors in their brains, just like all of us have the
13:47:28
 8
same receptors.
13:47:29
 9
And they all quit.  And there was no evidence that
13:47:32
this -- the fact that you get some extra receptors when you
13:47:37
smoke, that that is what stops you from smoking.
13:47:40
The evidence is it's the most common health
13:47:44
behavior change that people make.  60 million people have
13:47:48
done it.  And their brains, the cigarette design, the
13:47:54
filters, none of that stopped them.
13:47:57
And we know for a fact that it didn't stop
13:48:00
Mrs. Burkhart.  Because when she made up her mind for the
13:48:02
first time, it wasn't nicotine or anything else.  She quit.
13:48:06
Now, this is Dr. Cummings' own guide.  This was
13:48:12
their expert.  And he says, there's no magic cure that can
13:48:15
help you to stop.  But if you answer yes to these three
13:48:18
things, you can quit.
13:48:19
Do you want to stop?
13:48:20
Are you willing to make some changes?
13:48:22
And are you willing to put up with some uneasy
    31
13:48:25
 1
moments?
13:48:26
 2
And that's their expert, ladies and gentlemen.
13:48:29
 3
That's not a tobacco company.  That's the American Cancer
13:48:31
 4
Society and their witness.
13:48:33
 5
Now, let's talk about the verdict form and some of
13:48:35
 6
the things you're going to decide.  We know that
13:48:39
 7
Mrs. Burkhart has the burden of proof on each of her
13:48:40
 8
claims.  As Judge Jones instructed you on the defenses, we
13:48:46
 9
have the burden of proof.
13:48:46
You're going to be asked whether addiction --
13:48:50
addiction, not smoking -- but whether addiction was a cause
13:48:53
of her injury.  And this is the actual instruction that
13:48:58
you're going to get.
13:49:00
And the instruction is, in order to answer yes,
13:49:03
addiction has to directly -- so that's the first thing,
13:49:06
directly -- and in a natural and continuous sequence --
13:49:10
that's the second thing, continuous -- produced or
13:49:14
contributed substantially to producing such injuries.
13:49:17
So there's three major issues I want you to think
13:49:20
about the evidence on:  Whether it was a direct cause,
13:49:24
whether it was a continuous cause, and whether it was a
13:49:27
substantial cause.
13:49:29
You saw a lot of evidence.  Let's review it.  This
13:49:34
will be the first two questions.  I think they're question
13:49:37
1-A and 1-B on the verdict form.
    32
13:49:40
 1
Right off the bat, Dr. Burns, who wrote this
13:49:44
 2
report, admitted to me on the video there is no
13:49:48
 3
consensus -- meaning there is no argument -- on the
13:49:50
 4
criteria for diagnosing nicotine addiction in an
13:49:54
 5
individual.
13:49:54
 6
It's a little different to say, here's the
13:49:57
 7
definition of whether a drug is addictive and actually
13:50:00
 8
applying it to an individual person.  What are the
13:50:03
 9
criteria?
13:50:04
The Surgeon General himself says no agreement on
13:50:07
the criteria for diagnosing nicotine addiction.  And
13:50:11
Dr. Burns agreed, in a person.
13:50:13
So plaintiff's, you've seen their definition.
13:50:17
Their definition is, it's a brain disease and it causes
13:50:20
chronic relapse.  A brain disease they call it that causes
13:50:25
chronic relapse.
13:50:26
Well, let's see if their definition --
13:50:28
MR. HEIMANN:  Excuse me.  This is
13:50:29
misrepresentation.  It was about nicotine, diagnosing
13:50:33
nicotine addiction.  Now he's --
13:50:40
MR. BELASIC:  That's the whole point, Your Honor.
13:50:41
THE COURT:  We'll note the difference.  I remind
13:50:43
you that this is -- overruled.
13:50:44
I'll remind you that this is counsel's argument.
13:50:48
Your memory of the facts is what prevails.  Counsel are not
    33
13:50:52
 1
witnesses.
13:50:53
 2
MR. BELASIC:  Counsel is absolutely correct.  And,
13:50:54
 3
ladies and gentlemen, that's my point.
13:50:56
 4
They produced a definition of what makes a
13:50:59
 5
substance addictive.  They produced no definition, they
13:51:03
 6
didn't produce the criteria to diagnose an individual.
13:51:06
 7
The Surgeon General says there is no agreement.
13:51:08
 8
Now, their definition is from NIDA, the National
13:51:12
 9
Institute of Drug Abuse.  And they admit it just applies to
13:51:16
any drug.  Could apply to heroin, cocaine, barbiturates.
13:51:20
It's not a specific definition of nicotine addiction.
13:51:22
It wasn't meant to apply to an individual.  That's
13:51:26
what Dr. Burns said when I asked him.
13:51:28
And, in fact, if you look at their definition, it
13:51:31
doesn't have individual criteria at all.  But let's think,
13:51:35
does Mrs. Burkhart meet their definition?  But more
13:51:39
importantly, did they meet their burden of proof?  Because
13:51:43
they have to meet their burden of proof.
13:51:46
The first thing is the NIDA definition talks about
13:51:49
chronic relapse.
13:51:51
MR. HEIMANN:  I object to this, Your Honor.
13:51:53
There's no proof of any brain injury.  You can't have proof
13:51:55
of brain injury in this sense unless she's dead and you do
13:51:58
an autopsy.
13:51:59
MR. BELASIC:  Objection to the argument.
    34
13:52:02
 1
THE COURT:  I don't understand the objection.
13:52:03
 2
MR. HEIMANN:  See the fourth bullet point here, no
13:52:05
 3
proof of any brain injury.  It would be impossible to have
13:52:08
 4
proof of any brain injury, because she's alive.  The only
13:52:10
 5
way --
13:52:11
 6
THE COURT:  You may note that for the jury.  I'm
13:52:13
 7
overruling the objection.
13:52:14
 8
But, again, counsel is not a witness.  Your memory
13:52:18
 9
controls.  And counsel, of course, can point out any
13:52:23
inconsistencies in his reargument.
13:52:25
MR. BELASIC:  So let's talk about the first part
13:52:27
of their definition, or one part where they say chronic
13:52:30
relapse.  And chronic means more than temporary.  It means
13:52:33
continuous or over a long period of time.
13:52:35
How many times did Mrs. Burkhart quit smoking and
13:52:39
then relapse?  And the answer is once.  Once in 36 years.
13:52:44
The only time she quit smoking for even a day,
13:52:46
even any length of time, was 1984, SmokEnders.
13:52:51
And she went back to it.  So if you count that as
13:52:54
a relapse, that is one time in 36 years.  Never stopped,
13:53:02
again, until 1994.
13:53:03
And then in her own mind, the first time she
13:53:06
really made up her mind, she quit.
13:53:08
So whether we speculate as to what was going on in
13:53:12
her brain, whether her brain was somehow different than the
    35
13:53:16
 1
60 million Americans who quit smoking -- with the same
13:53:19
 2
nicotine and the same cigarettes and the same type of
13:53:22
 3
brain -- no matter what we speculate, we know that she
13:53:26
 4
doesn't meet the definition of chronic relapse.
13:53:29
 5
One time in 36 years.
13:53:32
 6
And 100 percent success when she made up her mind.
13:53:36
 7
Just like Dr. Cummings said in his own testimony.  There
13:53:40
 8
was no relapse once she quit in 1994.
13:53:44
 9
Now, did they present evidence that her brain was
13:53:48
somehow different than every other smoker who quit?  Of
13:53:53
course not.
13:53:54
One last thing to think about, ladies and
13:53:57
gentlemen.  Was she really smoking for nicotine?  Well, her
13:54:00
own medical records suggest otherwise.
13:54:02
We know that in 1993, she got nicotine patches.
13:54:05
And I asked her, obviously she was getting nicotine during
13:54:07
that period.  She was getting nicotine from the patches.
13:54:10
She didn't stop smoking at all.  She wasn't
13:54:13
smoking for nicotine.
13:54:16
And in 1994, when she changed her mind, she wasn't
13:54:19
smoking for any reason at all.
13:54:22
This is what her husband said, all of the reasons
13:54:25
she enjoyed smoking:  Smoking, taste, relaxation,
13:54:29
responding to stress, the social benefits.  She even liked
13:54:33
the feel in her hand.
    36
13:54:34
 1
And you saw me ask her repeatedly about each brand
13:54:37
 2
that she smoked, whether she liked the taste, and for each
13:54:41
 3
brand whether she was even thinking of quitting.
13:54:45
 4
And each time she said, no, she wasn't thinking of
13:54:47
 5
quitting, she was looking for a different brand.  And for
13:54:50
 6
each brand, she said she liked the taste.  For different
13:54:54
 7
reasons.  Sometimes she liked menthols and then ended up
13:54:57
 8
hating it.  So Virginia Slims tasted better.  Sometimes she
13:55:01
 9
said the next brand.
13:55:02
But for each brand, she testified that she liked
13:55:04
the taste.
13:55:08
Now, however the plaintiffs define addiction, did
13:55:11
it control Mrs. Burkhart?  Did it remove her ability, her
13:55:16
free will, her ability to make her own decision?
13:55:20
We know from the evidence it did not.  She stopped
13:55:23
smoking and tried to stop smoking only once, in 1984,
13:55:27
before she quit for good.
13:55:29
And she says, under oath, looking back on that
13:55:32
day, looking back on that time, that that wasn't the type
13:55:36
of effort that she made in '94.
13:55:40
And she says, I wish I had done that, then she
13:55:42
could have quit.  And she could have quit earlier.
13:55:45
And Dr. Burns admits that she didn't lose the
13:55:48
capacity to quit at any time earlier.  After all, she was
13:55:52
smoking more than she ever had in '94.  And addiction
    37
13:55:56
 1
didn't stop her from putting it down when she made her mind
13:55:59
 2
up.
13:55:59
 3
Now, Dr. Burns did admit that Mrs. Burkhart would
13:56:05
 4
not have gotten COPD if she had quit when the '64 Surgeon
13:56:09
 5
General's report was published.  30 million people quit in
13:56:12
 6
the next ten years.  She didn't try.
13:56:14
 7
He admits that if she had quit when the warnings
13:56:18
 8
went on the pack, she wouldn't have got COPD.  13 million
13:56:22
 9
people quit in just the next four years.  She did not try.
13:56:25
And this is what Dr. Burns said, if you can quit
13:56:29
before age 45.  He said, if before age 45 you don't already
13:56:34
have abnormal lung function and you quit, then you don't
13:56:38
get COPD.
13:56:39
Now, Mrs. Burkhart was born in 1941.  I guess 45
13:56:46
would be 1986.  But at a minimum that means that if she had
13:56:51
quit in the 1970s, when warnings has been on the packs for
13:56:55
years, if she had quit in the 1970s when her own husband
13:57:00
said, they're going to kill you; if instead of saying, it's
13:57:04
my life and I know that and it's my decision, if she had
13:57:07
quit then, her own expert admits she would have avoided her
13:57:10
injury.
13:57:11
She said herself, it's an individual thing.  But
13:57:17
even more important, the Surgeon General agrees.
13:57:22
One of the issues -- and Mr. Heimann emphasized
13:57:24
it -- is substantial.  And he went into a lot of detail.
    38
13:57:27
 1
He gave various definitions for the word substantial.  So I
13:57:31
 2
think it's fair to say that that's an important issue here.
13:57:35
 3
If addiction really was a cause, if you decide she
13:57:37
 4
was addicted under some definition, was addiction really a
13:57:41
 5
substantial cause?
13:57:55
 6
Their definition is, you have this chronic
13:57:55
 7
relapse.  Well, what does the Surgeon General say?  Does
13:57:55
 8
the Surgeon General say that nicotine addiction or nicotine
13:57:55
 9
dependency is the -- is a substantial reason in why people
13:57:55
relapse?
13:57:58
Here's what the Surgeon General says.  Even in the
13:57:59
best circumstances, tobacco -- the measures of tobacco
13:58:04
dependence account for only a modest amount of variation.
13:58:07
Now, I didn't pull out as many definitions of the
13:58:12
word substantial as Mr. Heimann did.
13:58:14
But modest, a modest amount, a modest effect,
13:58:18
that's not substantial.  That's a Surgeon General's report.
13:58:22
That's the consensus.  That's the state of the art,
13:58:25
according to their experts.  
13:58:27
Nicotine addiction has only a modest effect on
13:58:29
relapse, so she doesn't even meet her own definition.  And
13:58:34
we know she only relapsed once in 36 years and has only a
13:58:38
modest effect.  It's not substantial.
13:58:41
And if you need one issue to decide on whether she
13:58:43
was addicted, it's this:  The Surgeon General doesn't say
    39
13:58:48
 1
that nicotine addiction has a substantial effect on whether
13:58:52
 2
you relapse.
13:58:53
 3
Look what the reason is.  That is important.
13:58:58
 4
Surgeon General says, this finding is consistent with the
13:59:01
 5
notion that relapse is a function of multiple person
13:59:05
 6
factors.  Surgeon General says it's person factors.
13:59:10
 7
Mrs. Burkhart says it's a personal thing.  They're on the
13:59:15
 8
same page.
13:59:16
 9
Now, you've heard the evidence about choice,
13:59:19
control, and responsibility.  I don't have to repeat that
13:59:22
it was her choice in '94, the first time she made up her
13:59:26
mind.  We know she was able to control.  We know their own
13:59:29
experts say that smokers are responsible for making that
13:59:32
decision.
13:59:33
But think about all of the evidence you've seen
13:59:35
about her ability to quit when you answer this question.
13:59:40
If addiction was really the cause of her disease, if
13:59:44
addiction was really forcing her to smoke, okay, then what
13:59:47
happened between August 9, the last day she smoked three
13:59:51
packs a day, three packs a day, and August 10, the day she
13:59:56
quit and never smoked again?
13:59:57
And we know her cigarettes didn't change.  We know
14:00:00
the cigarette design didn't change.  We know her nicotine
14:00:03
didn't change.  Nobody suggests her brain changed.
14:00:08
And what changed was her mind.  And her mind
    40
14:00:11
 1
changed because she made a decision, and she made a
14:00:14
 2
decision that this time she was going to make a serious
14:00:17
 3
commitment to quitting.
14:00:19
 4
As I said in opening, ladies and gentlemen, when
14:00:20
 5
she changed her mind and made that decision, she changed
14:00:24
 6
her life.  She went from, it's my life, I'm going to smoke;
14:00:28
 7
to, it's my life, I'm going to quit.
14:00:31
 8
And in her own words, she quit the first time she
14:00:34
 9
made that decision.  Now, what happened to addiction on
14:00:40
August 10?  What happened to the substantial effect that
14:00:44
Mr. Heimann talks about?
14:00:46
The truth for Mrs. Burkhart and from what we know
14:00:50
is that when she made that decision, suddenly addiction not
14:00:54
only did not have a substantial effect, it didn't have any
14:00:59
effect.
14:00:59
Now, does that mean that I'm claiming it was easy
14:01:01
for her to quit?  Are we saying it wasn't hard?  No, of
14:01:06
course, not.
14:01:07
Changing your life, going to work, going to
14:01:10
school, losing weight, starting an exercise program, giving
14:01:13
up smoking, life is hard.  But there's no line on your
14:01:18
verdict form that says, was it hard?
14:01:23
The verdict form says, was addiction a legal cause
14:01:26
of her injury?  And it wasn't.  Because she stopped when
14:01:30
she changed her mind.  And once she changed her mind,
    41
14:01:33
 1
addiction didn't have a substantial effect.  It had no
14:01:36
 2
effect.
14:01:36
 3
And for that reason, let's look one more time
14:01:43
 4
about whether this choice issue is made up.  We know the
14:01:47
 5
Surgeon General has called cigarette smoking personal
14:01:49
 6
choice.  You see it right there.
14:01:51
 7
Look what the Surgeon General says about the
14:01:53
 8
individual smoker.  Even though it's addictive, it's up to
14:01:56
 9
the individual smoker to decide whether or not to continue
14:02:00
that behavior.
14:02:02
And their expert, Dr. Burns, says smokers are
14:02:05
responsible for those choices.
14:02:07
This is the most recent Surgeon General.  And you
14:02:10
saw me ask Dr. Burns about this.  And it compares
14:02:13
secondhand smoke exposure.  It says secondhand smoke, if
14:02:17
you're around someone that's smoking, that's not your
14:02:20
choice.  That's involuntary.
14:02:21
But look what they talk about for regular smoking.
14:02:25
Individual choice.  It's secondhand smoke that's
14:02:28
involuntary.   
14:02:29
After all the discussions with Dr. Burns, the
14:02:35
bottom line is he says even an addicted smoker is
14:02:37
responsible for their smoking behavior, and it's up to the
14:02:40
individual smoker to continue smoking or quit.
14:02:44
Now, based on all of that evidence, their own
    42
14:02:46
 1
definition, their own lack of proof, the fact that
14:02:49
 2
addiction didn't stop her from quitting, that she made only
14:02:52
 3
one effort, that she herself says, looking back on, was not
14:02:56
 4
serious, you should answer no to the question of addiction
14:03:06
 5
and you should answer no to the question of whether
14:03:08
 6
addiction was a legal cause, a legal cause of her injury.
14:03:11
 7
Now, the next part of the verdict form, you're
14:03:13
 8
going to see a series of questions on whether Mrs. Burkhart
14:03:17
 9
relied on things that tobacco companies said.  There's a
14:03:21
whole series of questions.  But they're all the same
14:03:24
question over and over.
14:03:25
Did she rely on a statement or an omission from a
14:03:28
tobacco company?  Did she rely on a statement or an
14:03:31
omission that was the result of an agreement?  Well, the
14:03:34
evidence here is she didn't rely on those statements, and
14:03:37
it comes directly from Mr. and Mrs. Burkhart.
14:03:39
So what you'll be doing is looking at questions 2,
14:03:44
has three parts -- or four parts -- and question 3 that has
14:03:48
four parts.  All of them are on whether or not she relied
14:03:51
on a statement.
14:03:54
And we had some discussion this morning.  One of
14:03:56
the things you'll be asked is to decide, did she rely at
14:04:00
all?  And if she did, was it a statement that was made
14:04:03
before May 5, 1982, or after?
14:04:06
Well, we asked her that.  I asked her that on the
    43
14:04:11
 1
stand.  And you saw the videotaped testimony that she
14:04:14
 2
didn't hear any statement that it wasn't proven until
14:04:19
 3
after -- until after she went to SmokEnders in 1984.
14:04:23
 4
So she hadn't even heard a statement to rely on
14:04:26
 5
until after May 5, 1982.  And we know what her response
14:04:32
 6
was.  Who do they think they're kidding?  Of course it's
14:04:35
 7
harmful.  I didn't believe them at all.
14:04:37
 8
Now, I mentioned a little while ago that at the
14:04:43
 9
very end, Mrs. Burkhart -- you remember Mrs. Burkhart
14:04:47
became -- talked a little louder.  She was a little more
14:04:53
direct in her answers.  And you saw what her very last
14:04:57
answers were.  And she said, I didn't believe them at all.
14:05:00
And at that point in the cross-examination, we
14:05:03
were talking specifically about the improvements that she
14:05:05
says the tobacco companies promised.
14:05:08
And you saw the testimony.  You saw the videotaped
14:05:11
testimony that by the time it was the 1980s she not only
14:05:16
had never even heard a statement that it wasn't proven --
14:05:19
she didn't believe it when she later heard it -- but by the
14:05:23
time she got to the 1980s, she said she wasn't believing
14:05:26
that any cigarette was better for her, whether it was
14:05:28
filters or lights.
14:05:30
We're going to talk about the brands she smoked.
14:05:32
But that was her testimony.  There's no evidence in this
14:05:37
record that after May 5, 1982, Mrs. Burkhart heard a
    44
14:05:42
 1
statement and that she relied on it.
14:05:44
 2
And more importantly, as Mr. Heimann even showed
14:05:47
 3
you the instruction, she has to prove -- its her burden to
14:05:53
 4
prove that she relied on a statement and that's what caused
14:05:56
 5
her injury.
14:05:57
 6
Well, where's the evidence of that, ladies and
14:05:59
 7
gentlemen?  What is the statement she relied on after 1983
14:06:03
 8
that caused her to get COPD?
14:06:06
 9
Did any expert say, well, if she hadn't heard a
14:06:09
statement, she would have quit smoking?
14:06:13
Even though Mrs. Burkhart didn't say that.  I
14:06:14
asked her every time, when you switched brands whether it
14:06:16
was to lights or to filters, were you even thinking of
14:06:20
quitting at that time?  She said she wasn't.  And we know
14:06:25
she wasn't from the evidence.
14:06:26
So Mrs. Burkhart, there's no evidence that she
14:06:29
relied on a statement by R.J. Reynolds, American, Brown &
14:06:34
Williamson, no evidence she relied on a statement by
14:06:36
Lorillard or Philip Morris.  In fact, there's no evidence
14:06:41
she even heard of the industry organizations TIRC, the CTR,
14:06:47
the Tobacco Institute.
14:06:48
They didn't even present evidence that she had
14:06:51
ever heard of those organizations before she filed her
14:06:55
lawsuit.  And those 1950s blurry videos of, you know, some
14:07:01
of the men or scientists talking about it, there's no
    45
14:07:03
 1
connection to Mrs. Burkhart.  She says she didn't hear
14:07:07
 2
anything about it not being proven until 1984.  And then
14:07:11
 3
she said, who do they think they're kidding?  So she didn't
14:07:14
 4
rely.
14:07:18
 5
You know, we've had a lot of talk about
14:07:19
 6
advertising.  But what's ironic in this case is how many
14:07:23
 7
ads, how many ads were you folks shown that she actually
14:07:26
 8
saw?  Is it surprising that in a case where they claim
14:07:30
 9
false advertising, they didn't present evidence through
14:07:33
their experts of an ad that the plaintiffs actually saw?
14:07:37
You decide that.  I asked Dr. Cummings -- it was
14:07:41
one of my last questions -- Dr. Cummings, did you show a
14:07:46
single ad for a single brand that Mrs. Burkhart actually
14:07:49
smoked?
14:07:50
And he said, you know, I didn't, like it wasn't a
14:07:52
big deal.  Well, it is a big deal, ladies and gentlemen,
14:07:56
because Mrs. Burkhart has the burden of proof.  And so what
14:07:59
they did is show every other ad under the sun for every
14:08:02
other brand.
14:08:02
Let's talk about the only advertisement that she
14:08:05
said was appealing to her.  And she admitted that two days
14:08:09
ago.  The only advertisement that appealed to her was a
14:08:12
Virginia Slims lady in a business suit.  And we know the
14:08:17
slogan, "you've come a long way, baby."  She said that
14:08:20
appealed to her.
    46
14:08:21
 1
Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's not fraud.
14:08:23
 2
That's not fraud to show an attractive woman in a business
14:08:26
 3
suit, in a swimsuit, or anything else.  It's not fraud to
14:08:30
 4
have a slogan.
14:08:32
 5
Judge Jones told you in the middle of the trial,
14:08:35
 6
capitalism is not on trial.  Advertising is not on trial.
14:08:38
 7
And they don't identify anything in that ad that was false
14:08:41
 8
or that she believed.
14:08:43
 9
We'll talk a little more about her brand choices
14:08:45
now.  But this was the Virginia Slims ad.  Remember,
14:08:50
Dr. Proctor came in.  And we don't dispute this.  He sort
14:08:54
of bragged.  He said, I have the biggest database of
14:08:57
advertising or cigarette advertising in the world. 
14:09:00
Well, good for Dr. Proctor.  That is probably
14:09:03
true.  And out of the biggest database in the world, from a
14:09:06
man that's been paid $1.5 million to do this over and over
14:09:11
again, how many ads did he pull out that Mrs. Burkhart even
14:09:15
saw?  None.  Zero.
14:09:21
This is the ad he showed you.  And you'll remember
14:09:23
that the question was, from Miss London, what does the body
14:09:29
language of the woman tell you?
14:09:31
I objected.  He's not an expert on women's bodies.
14:09:34
Of course he's not.
14:09:35
But there's nothing in this ad, this ad that
14:09:39
Mrs. Burkhart didn't see, that anyone showed was false.
    47
14:09:42
 1
And remember what they left out?  I actually had
14:09:45
 2
to request the Judge to order them to read it.  They left
14:09:50
 3
out the box.  And the box is pretty important because that
14:09:53
 4
advertisement says, the Surgeon General has determined that
14:09:57
 5
cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.
14:09:59
 6
Now, it's not fraud to have an attractive woman.
14:10:04
 7
We wouldn't expect someone to advertise their products with
14:10:07
 8
unattractive models.  It's not the American way.  It's not
14:10:11
 9
fraud to have a brightly colored dress on.  And it's not
14:10:14
fraud to have a slogan of "you've come a long way, baby."
14:10:19
So the only ad that their expert actually showed
14:10:21
is something she didn't see that has the warning on it that
14:10:24
Congress determined is appropriate, that Congress
14:10:27
determined is legal to put in the ad.
14:10:31
Well, when she started, we know it wasn't ads.
14:10:36
She told me she never even saw a Pall Mall ad.  She smoked
14:10:40
because of her mom.
14:10:40
She told us when she switched to filters that it
14:10:43
was to keep tobacco out of her teeth.  Now, it was back in
14:10:46
the early '60s, ladies and gentlemen.  She couldn't have
14:10:49
been more direct.  It wasn't ladylike.  You didn't want to
14:10:52
have tobacco in your teeth, and that's why she switched to
14:10:56
Pall Mall filters.
14:10:57
It had nothing to do with health.  Now, I know she
14:11:00
claims later and her lawyer claims later it had to do with
    48
14:11:02
 1
health.  But we'll get there.
14:11:04
 2
Then she switched to Raleighs.  Raleighs had
14:11:07
 3
coupons.  Legal to have coupons.  Capitalism is not on
14:11:11
 4
trial.  No one is claiming that having a coupon is fraud.
14:11:14
 5
So she switched to Kents.  Mr. Heimann says, well,
14:11:20
 6
Kents was fraudulent.  We asked her very specifically, you
14:11:24
 7
didn't switch for health reasons.  She denied it.  I played
14:11:27
 8
the videotape.
14:11:29
 9
You saw the one-sentence question, one-sentence
14:11:31
answer.  And on videotape, just two days ago, she said she
14:11:34
didn't switch for health reasons.
14:11:37
Then she talked about the filter.  She was asked
14:11:39
specifically, you did not think Kents were safer?  We
14:11:43
rolled the videotape.  She said she didn't think Kents were
14:11:48
safer.  That's her direct testimony.  It's not a tobacco
14:11:52
company document or an executive.  Her direct testimony,
14:11:55
she did not think Kents were safer.
14:11:58
That's why we brought the videotape, because
14:12:01
sometimes witnesses change their stories at trial.  And in
14:12:04
this case, unfortunately, that's what happened with Mr. and
14:12:09
Mrs. Burkhart.
14:12:09
So you saw the videotape.  Now, she agreed with me
14:12:13
right off the bat.  She wasn't trying to quit.  This wasn't
14:12:15
a question, as Mr. Heimann suggested, I'm desperate to
14:12:21
quit.  Throw me a lifeline of a filter.  She said she
    49
14:12:24
 1
wasn't interested in quitting.  She said she was looking to
14:12:27
 2
a filter for taste.
14:12:28
 3
And when we asked her, when you say you thought
14:12:31
 4
the filter was better, isn't it true that the most you
14:12:33
 5
thought the filter would be better at would make it better
14:12:36
 6
tasting?
14:12:38
 7
She agreed.  And I had to play the videotape again
14:12:41
 8
that said just that, the most she thought the filter would
14:12:44
 9
do was make it taste better.
14:12:47
And then we asked her, well, did Kents taste
14:12:51
better?  And she said they did.  Now, there's no evidence
14:12:54
that any Kent ad caused her to develop COPD.  There's no
14:13:01
evidence that if Kent went off the market, she would have
14:13:03
quit smoking.
14:13:04
There's no evidence that anything that you would
14:13:06
have said to her at that point would have caused her to
14:13:08
quit.  She had the Surgeon General's warning in her hand,
14:13:13
and she never quit.
14:13:14
Virginia Slims, she told us she switched for taste
14:13:18
because she was sick of menthols, hated menthols at that
14:13:22
point.  Said that the very first brand -- she didn't shop
14:13:25
around.  The very first brand she went to was Virginia
14:13:29
Slims.  And she agreed, they tasted heavenly.  That's her
14:13:32
words, not mine.  They tasted heavenly.  And we heard what
14:13:36
she said about the slogan and the woman in a business suit.
    50
14:13:39
 1
That's not fraud.
14:13:40
 2
What we did ask her is, did you switch for lower
14:13:43
 3
tar?  She said she did not.  What we did ask her is that
14:13:47
 4
the warning, at the time she switched, whether it was the
14:13:49
 5
'80s, early '80s, late '80s, whatever it was, every
14:13:54
 6
single advertisement in America had to have the Surgeon
14:13:58
 7
General's warning.  That's not fraud.
14:14:01
 8
Congress determined it was legal to advertise with
14:14:03
 9
that warning.  And she saw those warnings.  So there wasn't
14:14:09
any fraud.
14:14:14
Now, I put up this instruction because the same
14:14:16
definition of legal cause that applies to addiction has to
14:14:19
apply here to reliance.
14:14:21
They have to show that not only did a tobacco
14:14:24
company say something that was false, that not only did
14:14:29
Mrs. Burkhart actually see it, that not only did she
14:14:33
actually change her behavior, meaning decide to continue
14:14:36
rather than quitting, but then prove that that would have
14:14:40
caused her injury.
14:14:41
And they don't have any of that proof.  It's just
14:14:45
speculation.  Mr. Heimann says, well, she would have quit.
14:14:48
But we know what she did when she got direct warnings.
14:14:53
Forget whether she thought a filter was safer.
14:14:55
Her husband said, the cigarettes you're smoking right there
14:14:58
that had filters and were lights, they will kill you.  That
    51
14:15:02
 1
didn't have an effect on her.  That didn't cause her to
14:15:04
 2
change her mind.
14:15:05
 3
There's no evidence that some sort of concealment
14:15:08
 4
or statement caused her injury.  And her own words, the
14:15:13
 5
very last part of her deposition when I said, we don't need
14:15:17
 6
any more questions or answers, she said I didn't believe
14:15:19
 7
them at all.
14:15:23
 8
So when you go to question 2-A and 2-B and 2-C,
14:15:30
 9
the answer is they haven't met their burden of proof.
14:15:34
There isn't any proof.  The answer is, no, she did not
14:15:37
rely.  The answer is, no, reliance wasn't a legal cause
14:15:41
because there's no reliance.
14:15:42
Question 2-D, did she rely on anything before or
14:15:50
after May 5, 1982?  There's no evidence she relied on
14:15:53
anything.
14:15:55
The evidence is that she said the first time she
14:15:57
heard someone say it isn't proven was after 1984 she didn't
14:16:01
believe it.  She said, who are they kidding?
14:16:04
And so based on the evidence, you should answer no
14:16:11
for all of those questions.
14:16:12
And I think here the Judge instructs you to select
14:16:16
all that apply.  Well, none of them apply.  There's no
14:16:18
evidence that she relied on concealment, either before '82
14:16:22
and certainly no evidence, ladies and gentlemen, after 1982
14:16:26
when she says in her own words, I didn't believe them at
    52
14:16:29
 1
all.  Who were they kidding?
14:16:31
 2
Question 3-A, did she rely to her detriment?  We
14:16:37
 3
know she didn't.  Same question.  You should answer no
14:16:41
 4
based on the evidence.  3-B, was reliance a legal cause?
14:16:45
 5
It doesn't exist.  The answer is no.  And the same for 3-C
14:16:49
 6
and 3-D.
14:16:55
 7
There's no evidence she relied.  And what the
14:16:57
 8
evidence is we don't have to speculate because what
14:16:59
 9
Mr. Heimann is suggesting, imagine if she heard something
14:17:03
else.  We don't have to speculate because we know what she
14:17:06
heard.  And what she heard was a warning that it could kill
14:17:10
her from the man she loved most.  And we know that didn't
14:17:12
change her behavior.  There's no evidence anything a
14:17:18
tobacco company could have said that would have changed it.
14:17:20
She told us herself, you can't tell a smoker to
14:17:24
quit, she said, because it's a personal thing.
14:17:27
Now, there's a question here of comparative fault.
14:17:30
What I want to remind you is that right off the bat,
14:17:33
Mr. Heimann said, well, we do agree, partially at fault,
14:17:37
partial cause of her own injury.  He emphasizes that it's
14:17:41
partial.
14:17:42
But let's think about what that means, that the
14:17:44
plaintiff admits that her own actions are a partial cause
14:17:47
of her injury.  Well, that has to admit -- that has to mean
14:17:53
that she had the ability to quit smoking.  Well, we know
    53
14:17:55
 1
she did.  But that has to mean, how could she cause her own
14:17:59
 2
injury, even partially, if she didn't have the ability?
14:18:01
 3
It wouldn't be admitting that, ladies and
14:18:03
 4
gentlemen.  They wouldn't be admitting any fault at all if
14:18:06
 5
she couldn't quit.  So they're admitting that she had the
14:18:09
 6
ability to quit.
14:18:10
 7
And they have to be admitting that she had the
14:18:14
 8
ability to quit at a time that she could have avoided her
14:18:19
 9
injury because if it was too late to quit, well, it
14:18:21
wouldn't be a cause of her injury, and they wouldn't admit
14:18:24
that.  So they are very upfront.  She doused her own
14:18:27
injury.  They say it's only in part.  But the evidence is,
14:18:31
based on their own admission, that she did cause her own
14:18:34
injury.
14:18:34
Now, you've seen the form.  And you've been given
14:18:40
the instructions.  What I want to talk about is the
14:18:43
evidence that goes to the issue of whether her choices were
14:18:46
the causes.
14:18:48
Well, she started because her mother smoked.  That
14:18:51
had nothing to do with the tobacco company.  We know
14:18:53
nothing the company said caused her to start.  We know she
14:18:56
was a regular smoker as an adult.  She wasn't a little kid.
14:19:00
All of these things about youth advertising, she smoked her
14:19:04
senior year of high school.  And she says it wasn't because
14:19:06
of advertising.  She didn't even start inhaling and become
    54
14:19:09
 1
a regular smoker until she was an adult.
14:19:12
 2
So this claim that youth advertising are in, it
14:19:17
 3
doesn't apply to this case.  I mean, they didn't present a
14:19:20
 4
shred of evidence that in 1958 there was an ad directed to
14:19:24
 5
youth that she even saw it.  She was very, very candid.
14:19:28
 6
Advertising didn't cause her to smoke.
14:19:30
 7
Well, we know that she saw her father and mother
14:19:34
 8
have the same type of discussions that she had with her own
14:19:37
 9
husband.  She saw the warnings to her mom.  We know in the
14:19:40
'50s she made no effort to quit even though the media was
14:19:43
reporting risks.
14:19:45
We know she read the papers.  She saw this
14:19:47
information.  Her own husband says that.  We know they
14:19:50
watched the TV news.  We know -- heard about the Surgeon
14:19:56
General's report.  According to Dr. Burns, basically,
14:19:58
everyone did.  It was front-page news.  It was the top
14:20:02
story.
14:20:02
We know she saw the warning.  And we know that she
14:20:05
made no response.  1966, her own expert admits she could
14:20:09
have quit smoking then.  She was warned.  We know even in
14:20:14
the '60s she was aware of nicotine.  Those are her words.
14:20:17
They're not mine.
14:20:18
We know that she believed that she was addicted,
14:20:21
so addiction wasn't concealed from her.  We know she
14:20:25
believed that 50 years ago in the 1960s.
    55
14:20:28
 1
We know she made no effort to quit in the '60s,
14:20:31
 2
despite her knowledge, despite the warning that was on
14:20:33
 3
every pack that she held in her hand.  We know in the '70s
14:20:37
 4
she saw the warning.  She admitted that.
14:20:40
 5
We know in the '70s, '74 to '75, her husband
14:20:45
 6
basically told her, smoking is dangerous, harm your
14:20:48
 7
breathing, and it could kill you.  Did she try to quit in
14:20:53
 8
the 1970s?  No, she did not.  Not at all.
14:20:56
 9
We know that this warning was on the pack.  She
14:21:01
says that she just didn't see it.  And I asked her because
14:21:06
I have a legal obligation.  I have to ask some hard
14:21:10
questions, no matter how sick Mrs. Burkhart is.  She
14:21:14
understood that I had to have her answer a question.  You
14:21:17
know that both she and her husband are experienced
14:21:20
witnesses in litigation.  They've both testified in five or
14:21:22
ten lawsuits before, at depositions.
14:21:25
You know, when I asked her, you know, how is it
14:21:27
that you could see the warning for the last 20 years, the
14:21:31
'66 warning, the '70 warning, all through the '70s, and
14:21:36
then when the warning says emphysema, suddenly she didn't
14:21:40
see it.  And we heard about, well, the type is small.  She
14:21:42
didn't look at it.  And you'll have to decide whether that
14:21:45
was credible.  And Miss Gallagher will talk a little more
14:21:48
about that.
14:21:48
But we know her answer to the risks of smoking
    56
14:21:52
 1
far, far back was that she knew it.  We knew that in her
14:21:56
 2
own words she said that it could kill her.  We know that
14:21:59
 3
her husband in the '70s used these terms to say she was
14:22:02
 4
killing herself.  We know she saw these public service
14:22:05
 5
announcements.
14:22:08
 6
We know when they had their verbal fights about
14:22:12
 7
smoking, that her response was, even though it could kill
14:22:14
 8
her, it's my life and I'll make my own decisions.  And we
14:22:17
 9
know, according to her husband in her own words, she said
14:22:21
that cigarettes could kill her.  We know for decades she
14:22:24
had a smoker's cough.
14:22:28
We know that even though she went to SmokEnders,
14:22:30
she smoked one day after three weeks.  Did she smoke a pack
14:22:37
that day and then go back to quitting?  Did she smoke two
14:22:41
packs that day and go back to an effort to quit?
14:22:43
No.  She never went back to SmokeEnders.  She
14:22:46
never stopped again until 1980 -- until 1994, and then she
14:22:50
quit for good because she said when she really made her
14:22:54
mind up, when she really got it into her head.
14:22:57
And so the response of the plaintiffs is, blame it
14:23:03
on the issues that were decided in Engle.  Blame it on the
14:23:07
statements that she didn't hear.  Blame it on the
14:23:09
statements that she didn't believe.  She didn't believe
14:23:12
them at all when she heard them.
14:23:14
And, ladies and gentlemen, you'll decide.  But
    57
14:23:19
 1
based on that evidence, based on that evidence,
14:23:22
 2
Mrs. Burkhart chose to smoke.  And we know from her own
14:23:25
 3
expert that smokers are responsible for their decisions,
14:23:28
 4
and we know from the facts that she was the only person who
14:23:31
 5
could decide.  She said you don't even tell a smoker not to
14:23:36
 6
smoke.  It's a personal decision.
14:23:38
 7
There wasn't someone in an office at a tobacco
14:23:41
 8
company that could take the cigarette out of her mouth.
14:23:44
 9
There wasn't someone at a tobacco company that could make
14:23:47
the decision for her.  And when she did make up her mind,
14:23:50
she quit, and she was responsible.
14:23:56
Now, I want to talk briefly about the issue of
14:23:59
May 5, 1990.  You know that one of the things the law
14:24:03
requires you to decide is whether or not Mrs. Burkhart knew
14:24:06
or should have known of her injuries before May 5, 1990.
14:24:11
I'm going to go through the evidence pretty
14:24:13
specifically.  But I want to emphasize what Judge Jones
14:24:16
instructed you -- and you'll have it in writing.  The
14:24:21
question isn't whether Mrs. Burkhart knew she had COPD.
14:24:25
It's knew or should have known.  And it will say that
14:24:29
should have known means exercising reasonable care.  And
14:24:33
you'll use your own common sense.  But the question isn't,
14:24:35
you don't get to say, well, I didn't know the name of the
14:24:38
disease or I didn't actually know I had it.  The
14:24:41
instruction on the verdict form, knew or should have known.
    58
14:24:46
 1
Now, let's look what you saw, and you'll decide.
14:24:49
 2
I think this is question -- this is going to be question 5.
14:24:55
 3
I want to say one other thing on the verdict form
14:24:57
 4
before you.  You know that question 4 is going to ask
14:25:03
 5
whether each -- plaintiff's smoking of each defendant's
14:25:05
 6
cigarette was a legal cause of her injury.  And that's
14:25:08
 7
their burden of proof.  You'll decide that issue.
14:25:10
 8
When we get to question 5, the statute of
14:25:13
 9
limitations, this is the type of evidence that we know is
14:25:15
true because all the experts agree.  Everyone agrees that
14:25:19
COPD is progressive.  It takes time.  It takes a lot of
14:25:23
time to reach a severe stage.  It takes years.
14:25:27
Dr. Burns agreed to that when I asked him on
14:25:30
video, and certainly Dr. Cosmo agreed.
14:25:33
We know that she had COPD symptoms.  And one of
14:25:36
the things I want to emphasize is that both sides' experts
14:25:40
agreed.  Dr. Burns agreed that there are symptoms of COPD
14:25:45
that include chronic cough and that include shortness of
14:25:49
breath.  He agreed she had those symptoms.  He agreed it
14:25:53
was reasonable to assume.  He said, well, we don't know for
14:25:56
sure, but he said it was reasonable to assume.
14:25:58
Well, since Dr. Burns hasn't spent much time
14:26:01
seeing patients at all for the last 25 years, we brought in
14:26:05
the expert who sees thousands of patients a year.  And that
14:26:08
was Dr. Cosmo, who's been a board-certified pulmonologist
    59
14:26:13
 1
for 28 years.  He sees, he said, about 800 patients a
14:26:18
 2
month.
14:26:18
 3
We know she was aware of the symptoms.  The
14:26:23
 4
symptoms, they weren't secret.  It wasn't like tumors in
14:26:26
 5
your symptom.  None of us would know.
14:26:28
 6
The symptoms that she knew about were open and
14:26:31
 7
obvious.  They were complaints that she had.  She woke up
14:26:36
 8
in the morning in the early '80s unable to breathe because
14:26:39
 9
her coughing was so severe.  She had tightness of the
14:26:42
chest.  She had shortness of breath in the early '80s.
14:26:45
Remember her husband says when they're living in Houston,
14:26:48
she starts exhibiting shortness of breath, especially when
14:26:51
they travel.  And he says that she attributed it to
14:26:55
smoking.
14:26:56
So these symptoms are things she knew.  We don't
14:26:58
even have to guess, should she have known?  We know she
14:27:01
knew them, and we know she had these symptoms before May 5,
14:27:05
1990, because that's what she says and that's what her own
14:27:08
husband says, and that's what the experts say who looked at
14:27:13
the testimony.  No question she blamed those symptoms on
14:27:16
her smoking.
14:27:18
Now, Mrs. Burkhart, on the stand, agreed she had a
14:27:21
smoker's cough in the '70s when she met her husband.  She
14:27:24
said by the late '70s or the early '80s she linked it to
14:27:29
her smoking.  She thought smoking was causing a cough that
    60
14:27:32
 1
Dr. Cosmo says was progressively getting worse and was not
14:27:36
 2
just a simple smoker's cough but was the kind of cough that
14:27:39
 3
was a symptom of COPD.
14:27:42
 4
And by the early '80s, there were times she
14:27:45
 5
couldn't even breathe in the morning.  And that's the
14:27:56
 6
reason I asked Dr. Burns, weren't these symptoms of COPD?
14:27:56
 7
Now, you might expect well, he's on the plaintiff's side,
14:27:56
 8
that he'd say, heck, no.  No way.  But what he did say is
14:27:59
 9
the opposite.  He said, well, it's reasonable to assume
14:28:02
that they were symptoms of COPD.
14:28:04
So there's not a lot of daylight between the
14:28:07
experts on these issues, between Dr. Burns and between
14:28:11
Dr. Cosmo.  Those are symptoms of COPD.  She knew she had
14:28:15
them.  And there's no question she had them before 1990.
14:28:20
Well, did she know she was addicted?  Well,
14:28:23
Mr. Heimann admitted that she was.  She told me that she
14:28:26
believed then that she was addicted in the '60s.  There's
14:28:30
not going to be any question about whether she was aware or
14:28:32
believed that.
14:28:33
Now, no one questions Dr. Cosmo's credentials.  I
14:28:38
mean, I guess Miss London said, well, you don't write
14:28:42
Surgeon General's reports.  Well, you know, in this case,
14:28:44
that's a good thing because we want a doctor who has seen
14:28:48
thousands of patients and not a man who writes articles.
14:28:50
Dr. Cosmo, you heard, in 14 years of reviewing
    61
14:28:54
 1
medical records, he's made about $80,000.  14 years,
14:28:57
 2
$80,000.  That's about $5,000 a year.
14:29:00
 3
Dr. Burns has pulled down almost $4 million.  And
14:29:05
 4
you heard he's worked for 25 cases with these lawyers with
14:29:08
 5
the law firm.  Every time he takes the stand for these
14:29:12
 6
lawyers, he says the smoker was addicted.  Every time he
14:29:15
 7
takes the stand for these lawyers, he says addiction was
14:29:18
 8
the cause.
14:29:18
 9
Dr. Cosmo never, ever, ever testified for a
14:29:25
tobacco company before.  He's not someone whose opinions,
14:29:29
you know, are the result of millions of dollars.
14:29:32
No one disputes his credentials.  And no one
14:29:38
disputes this piece of evidence.  And the reason no one
14:29:40
disputes this is because this is objective.  It's a
14:29:42
scientific medical test that measures a person's lung
14:29:46
function.
14:29:46
And then they take what your lung function is,
14:29:50
what you measure, against what the predicted value is
14:29:53
supposed to be for a person your age.
14:29:56
And I'd like to direct your attention to the 34.
14:30:01
And Dr. Cosmo explained that that means at that point that
14:30:06
her lung function, Mrs. Burkhart's lung function in 1993,
14:30:10
was only 34 percent of the predicted value.
14:30:14
And he said that's very severe.  Very severe.  80
14:30:19
percent is mild COPD.  80 percent.
    62
14:30:23
 1
He then explained that to get from 80 percent,
14:30:26
 2
mild COPD, all the way down to 34 percent, severe COPD, it
14:30:32
 3
takes a long time.  Because you only lose 3 percent a year,
14:30:36
 4
4 percent a year.  He said maximum, 5 percent a year.
14:30:40
 5
So if COPD is at 80 percent, that's mild COPD, and
14:30:47
 6
she was all the way down to 34 -- you lose 3, 4, 5 percent
14:30:51
 7
a year as he explained -- that's over a decade that she had
14:30:54
 8
COPD.
14:30:55
 9
So there's no question that her COPD, it didn't
14:30:59
start in 1993.  And it didn't start in 1990.  As Dr. Cosmo
14:31:04
said, it could have started as early as the mid-1980s.  And
14:31:09
that's just simple math.
14:31:10
No one disputed the pulmonary function test.  I'm
14:31:14
not sure that Dr. Burns even talked about this issue.  No
14:31:17
one disputed that you only lose a certain amount of lung
14:31:20
volume a year.
14:31:22
And that's why it was so important when Dr. Burns
14:31:25
told me, yeah, it's reasonable to assume she had those
14:31:28
symptoms.
14:31:29
Dr. Cosmo was asked, look, is there any way, is
14:31:34
there some unusual circumstance, anything in her background
14:31:37
where she could have not had COPD by May 5, 1990, and it
14:31:43
just developed in only a couple of years?
14:31:46
And he said no.  It's impossible.  It's
14:31:47
impossible.  And he wasn't challenged on that.
    63
14:31:51
 1
Miss London didn't challenge that when she
14:31:54
 2
cross-examined him.  That's undisputed.
14:31:56
 3
So when you answer the question on statute of
14:32:03
 4
limitations, did she know or should she have known of her
14:32:07
 5
symptoms, did she know or should she have known that she
14:32:11
 6
was addicted and that it was linked?  Well, in her own
14:32:15
 7
words she did know.  She believed she was addicted.  She
14:32:17
 8
knew she had all of these symptoms.  She knew she did.
14:32:20
 9
And there's no question, this isn't something
14:32:22
where you have to -- where anyone has to make up the
14:32:25
evidence.  She believed she was addicted in the '60s.
14:32:29
She believed that -- she knew she had these symptoms in the
14:32:32
'70s and '80s.  She said she believed they were related to
14:32:36
smoking.  And as Dr. Cosmo says, it's impossible that she
14:32:39
didn't have COPD.
14:32:41
That's the burden of proof, ladies and gentlemen.
14:32:42
And we submit, we've met it.  And maybe that's why
14:32:48
Dr. Burns told me, well, it's reasonable to assume that I'm
14:32:51
right, that she had those symptoms of COPD.
14:32:53
I'm not sure what to say about what Mr. Heimann
14:32:58
said about damages.  He didn't give you a single basis, a
14:33:03
single basis for his number.  He didn't tell you why he
14:33:07
came up with it.  He didn't tell you how he calculated it.
14:33:11
What he said was, he thinks if you have a broken
14:33:14
ankle, you get $10,000.  I don't know, ladies and
    64
14:33:16
 1
gentlemen.  That's not this case.
14:33:18
 2
He said if you have a crushed leg, maybe you get a
14:33:21
 3
couple hundred thousand.  I don't know where he's getting
14:33:23
 4
that.
14:33:24
 5
But the bottom line is, there isn't any specific
14:33:27
 6
evidence that suggests that the number that he got was
14:33:31
 7
anything other than a plaintiffs's lawyer who pulled that
14:33:36
 8
number out of the air.
14:33:37
 9
He didn't give you any rationale for that.  He
14:33:42
said -- you know, at first he started saying, well, I can't
14:33:44
come up with a number.  And I thought, oh, he's going to
14:33:47
leave it up to the jurors.  But sure enough, he came up
14:33:50
with a number.  What he didn't do was provide any basis and
14:33:53
any rationale for it.
14:33:55
Now, I think under the evidence -- and we've
14:33:57
talked about that -- that you shouldn't be even reaching
14:34:01
that portion of the verdict form.  Because the evidence is
14:34:05
clear that addiction wasn't the cause of her injury, that
14:34:09
her choice to smoke was.  And that we know her choice to
14:34:12
smoke was something she exercised, despite and regardless
14:34:16
of addiction.
14:34:17
And that when she stopped, she could quit, even if
14:34:20
you call her addicted.  So I don't think you're getting
14:34:23
there.  But he didn't provide any rationale for that
14:34:26
number.
    65
14:34:27
 1
I think they knew it was shocking, right?
14:34:29
 2
Remember when Miss London said, we're going to give you a
14:34:34
 3
number and you're going to find it shocking.  They didn't
14:34:36
 4
give any explanation of why that number, $15 million, is
14:34:40
 5
justified.
14:34:41
 6
And I'll ask you to think that there's 60 million
14:34:45
 7
people who quit smoking.  One of them is Mrs. Burkhart.  We
14:34:47
 8
know that tens of millions of people were quitting smoking
14:34:50
 9
in the '60s and '70s, when her own expert says she could
14:34:54
have avoided her injury.
14:34:55
And they don't prevent -- or present any evidence
14:34:58
that she was different than the 60 million people who quit.
14:35:01
But what they say is because she chose to smoke until '94,
14:35:08
that when she gets a disease, they say now she gets $15
14:35:12
million, even though 60 million people quit and tens of
14:35:18
millions quit when she was being warned.
14:35:20
You decide if that makes sense under the facts of
14:35:22
this case, not what some Engle jury who never even heard of
14:35:27
Mrs. Burkhart thought.
14:35:28
Now, finally, he argues they're entitled to
14:35:33
punitive damages.  The judge's instructions say punitive
14:35:36
damages are for the purposes of punishment and deterrence.
14:35:39
And I'm going to talk a little about those.
14:35:40
That's going to be the final question on the
14:35:44
verdict form.  You have to find by clear and convincing
    66
14:35:47
 1
evidence that punitive damages are warranted against each
14:35:50
 2
defendant.
14:35:53
 3
Now, Mr. Heimann himself said that the issue of
14:35:56
 4
compensatory damages means that once -- if you reach it,
14:35:59
 5
and I don't think -- I don't think you should be reaching
14:36:02
 6
it.  But if you reach, with all respect, ladies and
14:36:04
 7
gentlemen, this question, compensatory damages are designed
14:36:08
 8
to fully compensate the person.
14:36:10
 9
And Mr. Heimann read the instructions, full and
14:36:13
just compensation.
14:36:16
So once you get to punitives, you would have
14:36:18
already decided that she is fully compensated.  Punitives
14:36:21
are extra money.  And it's extra money that's going to go,
14:36:25
if awarded, only to Mrs. Burkhart.  Not to a charity or for
14:36:30
people who quit smoking.  This is her claim for additional
14:36:32
money.
14:36:38
You have to find that the defendants actually had
14:36:40
actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of their conduct.  And
14:36:43
they intentionally pursued that conduct and that resulted
14:36:47
in the plaintiff's injuries.
14:36:48
Now, Mr. Heimann suggested that one of the reasons
14:36:51
that you should award punitives is because they sold
14:36:53
cigarettes even though cigarettes were dangerous.  And
14:36:57
that's why I reminded you that Congress decided you can
14:37:01
sell cigarettes, even if they're dangerous, with the
    67
14:37:03
 1
warning on the pack.
14:37:05
 2
MR. HEIMANN:  Again, I object to this.
14:37:06
 3
THE COURT:  I'm going to have to sustain that one.
14:37:08
 4
I just remind the jury, I told you that the sale
14:37:11
 5
and/or advertising was legal.  But that does not absolve
14:37:17
 6
the tobacco companies from potential liabilities under the
14:37:20
 7
standards I've given you.
14:37:21
 8
This is not a claim, I'll repeat again, under
14:37:26
 9
mislabeling.  They've not made that claim.  This is a claim
14:37:29
on the fraudulent issues for withholding information,
14:37:33
concealing information that they were aware of, and on
14:37:37
negligence for selling a defective and dangerous product.
14:37:42
That's the claim.  It has nothing to do with mislabeling.
14:37:47
Go ahead.  I'm sorry.
14:37:49
MR. BELASIC:  Now, Mr. Heimann says, well, you
14:37:51
know, they kept the dangers secret so she gets extra money.
14:37:55
You know, he didn't mention any figure, and so we
14:37:59
don't know, but what we do know is that the information on
14:38:02
the dangers of smoking weren't a secret.  What they're
14:38:05
actually saying is the tobacco companies didn't agree at a
14:38:09
certain moment in time.  We know they weren't secret.
14:38:12
I mean, we had this battle, who could put up the
14:38:15
most evidence of historical knowledge and information?  And
14:38:18
I won't belabor this.  But one of the things is we ran out
14:38:22
of room on the board because it only went back to the
    68
14:38:25
 1
1940s.
14:38:26
 2
And the Florida Department of Health was saying
14:38:28
 3
100 years ago that you could call nicotine addictive.  As
14:38:34
 4
far back as the 1920s -- 
14:38:35
 5
MR. HEIMANN:  I'm going to object.  This is
14:38:37
 6
challenging the Engle findings.  The Engle findings are
14:38:39
 7
they concealed information that wasn't known or knowable.
14:38:42
 8
That's the finding.  He can't challenge that now.
14:38:44
 9
THE COURT:  He can.  I'll just simply partially
14:38:47
sustain.  But I'll have to overrule the objection as to his
14:38:52
argument.
14:38:52
He has the right to argue that punitive damages
14:38:54
are not warranted because there's no need to deter or
14:39:02
punish the conduct.
14:39:03
MR. BELASIC:  And, ladies and gentlemen, if you
14:39:04
look in your instructions, you will see a specific written
14:39:06
instruction from Judge Jones that says punitive damages
14:39:09
cannot be based on the Engle findings.
14:39:12
This is a question of Mrs. Burkhart.
14:39:13
THE COURT:  Solely on the Engle findings.  It's
14:39:16
not enough to find warranted damages, punitive damages
14:39:22
solely based upon application of the Engle finding.
14:39:25
MR. BELASIC:  All right.  So there's no dispute
14:39:27
that as far back as the 1920s they were talking about
14:39:31
smoking causing cancer.
    69
14:39:32
 1
I'll just give you a few examples.  Just click
14:39:34
 2
through.  100 years ago, our state government was saying it
14:39:37
 3
was addictive.  It's not a secret.
14:39:40
 4
Dr. Proctor admitted 70 years ago, the year she
14:39:43
 5
was -- the year Mrs. Burkhart was born, a "Reader's Digest"
14:39:46
 6
was saying that nicotine was the reason people smoked.
14:39:48
 7
They compared it to other drugs.
14:39:51
 8
We know that -- you saw this Claude Teague
14:39:57
 9
document from the '50s from Reynolds.
14:39:59
"Reader's Digest" was saying the same thing in
14:40:00
1924.  We know in the 1950s they were talking about cancer
14:40:04
by the carton.  Dr. Proctor himself said this magazine that
14:40:09
came out years before Mrs. Burkhart smoked talked about
14:40:12
cancer.
14:40:13
We know that the first document, the very first
14:40:15
document they used with their experts from 1935, not only
14:40:20
was it a secret, but, ladies and gentlemen, I had to wait
14:40:24
five or six hours to finally get up there and say, hey,
14:40:28
that was something that was sent to doctors.  It wasn't a
14:40:30
secret at all.
14:40:31
We know in 1942 they were publishing that if you
14:40:33
looked at it one way, a cigarette could be a means of
14:40:37
administering nicotine.  That wasn't a secret.
14:40:39
Even "Reader's Digest" was saying nicotine is the
14:40:41
essential ingredient.  And remember --
    70
14:40:44
 1
THE COURT:  I think I have to re-emphasize, he
14:40:46
 2
cannot challenge the Engle findings.  He cannot do that,
14:40:49
 3
say the Engle findings are not true in this case.  Can't do
14:40:53
 4
that.  The Engle findings were to the effect that there was
14:40:59
 5
fraud and that there was negligence.
14:41:03
 6
What he can do, however, is to say that in this
14:41:07
 7
case, punitive damages are not warranted under the standard
14:41:11
 8
I've given you in the legal instructions.
14:41:14
 9
So just that caution.  I'm not going to stop his
14:41:17
argument here.  I just remind you, as a matter of law, he
14:41:20
cannot challenge the Engle findings.
14:41:22
MR. BELASIC:  And so there's no question, ladies
14:41:24
and gentlemen, that's exactly what I am arguing.
14:41:28
Mrs. Burkhart, her lawyer says she wants 10 or $15 million
14:41:32
for choosing to smoke, and choosing to quit in 1994,
14:41:36
because she got sick.
14:41:37
Now she says, and he says, that she wants
14:41:40
additional money.  Punitive damages are not warranted under
14:41:44
these facts.
14:41:46
So let's talk about whether or not it was
14:41:50
concealed and what the experts said.
14:41:52
We know this is the evidence.
14:41:55
MR. HEIMANN:  Objection.
14:41:55
THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain the objection,
14:41:57
sir.  You cannot challenge the Engle findings that there
    71
14:42:00
 1
was misstatement or not misstatement.
14:42:03
 2
MR. BELASIC:  All right.  May I present the
14:42:04
 3
evidence that Dr. Burns presented?
14:42:07
 4
THE COURT:  No.
14:42:07
 5
MR. BELASIC:  All right.
14:42:08
 6
Now, one of the things we know is that
14:42:16
 7
Mrs. Burkhart said that when she saw the statements, she
14:42:21
 8
didn't rely.  That she said she saw them in the '80s, and
14:42:26
 9
she said, who are they kidding?  And we know from
14:42:28
Dr. Proctor that wasn't unusual.  The question of reliance
14:42:31
here is an individual question.
14:42:33
And Dr. Proctor says for the last 50 years, only 3
14:42:37
to 5 percent of people ever said the tobacco companies were
14:42:40
reliable.
14:42:40
And Mrs. Burkhart wasn't one of them.  Because
14:42:43
we've reviewed the evidence.  She didn't believe -- when
14:42:46
she finally heard some statements in the '80s, she said,
14:42:49
who are they kidding?
14:42:50
And she didn't think her cigarettes were safer.
14:42:53
And she certainly didn't refuse to quit because of some
14:42:56
advertisement.
14:42:56
Now, they brought up Dr. Cummings to show some
14:43:02
research documents.  And I emphasize research, because the
14:43:05
documents that he showed you about cigarette design weren't
14:43:09
about actual cigarettes for the actual brands that
    72
14:43:13
 1
Mrs. Burkhart smoked.
14:43:14
 2
He was very careful to show research documents
14:43:18
 3
about what researchers were looking at.
14:43:21
 4
And he said, well, the pH of cigarettes can effect
14:43:25
 5
it.
14:43:25
 6
What he didn't tell you was that the Reynolds'
14:43:31
 7
document, one of the 60 million documents, and one
14:43:33
 8
apparently he didn't review, says there is no evidence from
14:43:36
 9
the historical data, going all the way out to 1996 after
14:43:41
Mrs. Burkhart quit, there's no evidence from this data that
14:43:42
smoke pH was purposefully increased to enhance sales.  If
14:43:47
you look at the sentence before, what happened is, there's
14:43:50
no correlation between sales and pH.
14:43:54
And when I asked Dr. Cummings, do you even know
14:43:57
the pH level of any brand that Mrs. Burkhart smoked?  He
14:44:02
said no.
14:44:03
He hadn't looked at this data.  Look at this.
14:44:07
R.J. Reynolds comparing sales and pH values.  Well, the pH
14:44:10
is the top line.  It goes up.  It goes down.  It goes up.
14:44:13
It goes down.
14:44:15
Dr. Cummings said, it varies from year to year,
14:44:17
that even agriculture variations -- hot year, dry year --
14:44:21
pH is going to change.
14:44:23
But look at the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen,
14:44:26
every year, down, down, down, down, down.
    73
14:44:28
 1
Dr. Cummings' assertion, based on a handful of
14:44:33
 2
cherrypicked documents from the '70s, that there was some
14:44:36
 3
connection between pH and sales, he didn't look at the
14:44:38
 4
data.  And he didn't -- he admitted he didn't look at
14:44:41
 5
anything for an actual cigarette that Mrs. Burkhart smoked.
14:44:45
 6
Now, did the cigarette companies design cigarettes
14:44:51
 7
to be more addictive?  Were Mrs. Burkhart's cigarettes more
14:44:55
 8
addictive than they were in the old days?
14:44:58
 9
Dr. Cummings said, and his conclusion, his own
14:45:00
studies, roll-your-own cigarettes -- you buy tobacco and
14:45:04
you roll your own -- those are more addictive.
14:45:06
The people who smoke roll-your-owns are more
14:45:08
addicted than the people who smoke the Kents and the
14:45:12
Marlboros and the Winstons and the Virginia Slims and the
14:45:15
Kools.  He says that the people who smoke roll-your-owns
14:45:18
are less interested in quitting.
14:45:20
And that's their expert, ladies and gentlemen.
14:45:24
I asked Dr. Cummings, isn't it true that the
14:45:27
Surgeon General knew about all of these design changes and
14:45:30
reviewed them in a report.  So the 1979 Surgeon General's
14:45:35
report is in evidence.  The 1979 Surgeon General's
14:45:38
report -- look, if you would, ladies and gentlemen, along
14:45:41
the left side, under tobacco processing.
14:45:44
You see reconstituted tobacco sheet.  He talked
14:45:47
about that.  Look what the effect on tar and nicotine is.
    74
14:45:51
 1
It's a plus.
14:45:52
 2
Well, in this case, plus is good.  At the bottom,
14:45:56
 3
where I've highlighted, it tells you what plus means.  It
14:46:00
 4
says reductions.  Not increases.  Reductions.
14:46:03
 5
Two pluses means a 50 percent or greater
14:46:07
 6
reduction.  A one plus means a significant reduction.
14:46:11
 7
Surgeon General knew about this, researched it,
14:46:14
 8
published it.  It wasn't secret.  And the Surgeon General's
14:46:18
 9
conclusion was that reconstituted tobacco sheet gets a
14:46:22
star, they get a plus, because it reduces nicotine, it
14:46:26
reduces tar.
14:46:27
And look what the other column I highlighted says.
14:46:32
Carcinogenicity.  Means cancer producing ability.
14:46:37
Reconstituted tobacco sheet, a plus, meaning significant
14:46:42
reduction.
14:46:42
The Surgeon General goes down the line.  Look
14:46:44
under cigarette production.  Paper porosity, it reduces tar
14:46:51
and nicotine, because a plus means a significant reduction.
14:46:54
Perforated filters.  Dr. Cummings spent a lot of
14:46:57
time on that.  He didn't tell you that the Surgeon General
14:46:59
knew about it and had studied it.  And the Surgeon
14:47:02
General's report card here, perforated filters are a plus.
14:47:06
That means a significant reduction.
14:47:08
The same thing for the cellulose acetate filter, a
14:47:12
plus, a significant reduction.
    75
14:47:14
 1
Now, under those facts and under the admissions of
14:47:19
 2
their expert, there's no evidence there was anything done
14:47:22
 3
to one of Mrs. Burkhart's cigarettes that stopped her from
14:47:25
 4
quitting.  She quit smoking when she was smoking lights.
14:47:29
 5
There's no evidence she was smoking -- that there was some
14:47:32
 6
effect on her.
14:47:33
 7
There's no evidence that there was deliberate
14:47:36
 8
wrongdoing.  And remember, when the companies were making
14:47:39
 9
these design changes, the Surgeon General knew about it
14:47:43
back in the '70s.
14:47:44
And the Surgeon General did his own research, not
14:47:47
biased or tobacco company research.  He did his own
14:47:50
research.  And the Surgeon General said those are positive
14:47:52
changes.
14:47:54
Because, as Dr. Cummings says, it's a good thing
14:47:57
to reduce carcinogenicity.  It's a good thing to reduce tar
14:48:02
and nicotine.  That's a Surgeon General's report card,
14:48:05
ladies and gentlemen.
14:48:05
The company shouldn't be punished for doing
14:48:07
something that the Surgeon General at the time researched
14:48:10
and said was beneficial for health.
14:48:12
Now, we know that this didn't happen by accident,
14:48:16
because we heard that the companies worked with the
14:48:20
government to make safer cigarettes.  That was
14:48:23
Dr. Cummings.  I cross-examined him.  It was called the
    76
14:48:26
 1
National Cancer Institute Tobacco Working Group.  And the
14:48:29
 2
title of the program was "less hazardous cigarette
14:48:32
 3
program."
14:48:32
 4
It was voluntary.  The tobacco company top
14:48:35
 5
scientists agreed to participate.  They participated for
14:48:38
 6
ten years.
14:48:40
 7
Dr. Cummings says they researched for years.  They
14:48:42
 8
came up with all kinds of alternative cigarettes.  And the
14:48:46
 9
research was published.
14:48:48
And he admitted the top scientist at Lorillard,
14:48:50
the top scientist at Philip Morris, the top scientist at
14:48:56
R.J. Reynolds took their time.  The tobacco companies spent
14:48:58
their money.  The tobacco companies did the lab research.
14:49:01
They shared that research in publications with the
14:49:05
government from 1968 to '78.
14:49:08
And he admitted it was the government that shut it
14:49:11
down.
14:49:13
Now, they voluntarily worked with the government
14:49:15
to make safer cigarettes.  And here's one of the things we
14:49:18
saw from an internal government record that shows the
14:49:22
meeting.
14:49:23
That was the National Cancer Institute meeting of
14:49:29
1976.  We went through that at length.  The National Cancer
14:49:32
Institute was there.  The Department of Agriculture was
14:49:35
there.
    77
14:49:36
 1
And Dr. Cummings admitted that the government told
14:49:38
 2
the tobacco companies as part of this program to figure out
14:49:41
 3
ways to make a cigarette that would have a small level of
14:49:46
 4
tar but an extra level of nicotine.
14:49:48
 5
And Dr. Cummings admitted at that time there was a
14:49:51
 6
theory that would be a safer cigarette.  Because if you're
14:49:54
 7
smoking for nicotine, if you could have a cigarette that
14:49:57
 8
had more nicotine and less tar, that could be safer.
14:50:00
 9
This is not a secret tobacco company document.  If
14:50:04
anything, it was a secret government document at the time.
14:50:08
But it was the government that was supervising a program
14:50:12
that he admits was designed to make cigarettes safer.
14:50:16
And we went through it.  It talks about pH in
14:50:18
there.  It talks about reconstituted tobacco sheet.
14:50:21
And when they shut down the program, the
14:50:24
government thanked the tobacco scientists.  All right?
14:50:27
Now, 40 years later, a man that's been paid $1.5
14:50:33
million comes in and pulls out some 1970s research
14:50:36
documents and attacks the company.
14:50:37
Now, there's a phrase, "damned if you do and
14:50:40
damned if you don't."
14:50:42
When the tobacco companies take out nicotine, like
14:50:44
Philip Morris did when they made an extensive effort to
14:50:46
make the nicotine-free cigarette next, it wasn't welcomed
14:50:51
by the public health community.  It was attacked.
    78
14:50:54
 1
When the tobacco companies are told by the
14:50:57
 2
government it could be safer to have a low tar, medium
14:51:01
 3
nicotine cigarette, when we see in the own secret
14:51:03
 4
government documents that that program was being directed
14:51:05
 5
by the government, Dr. Cummings comes in and says, well,
14:51:10
 6
you shouldn't have done that either.
14:51:12
 7
The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that there
14:51:14
 8
isn't any evidence that the design of a cigarette that the
14:51:18
 9
only smoker in this case, Mrs. Burkhart, smoked made her
14:51:22
get COPD or made her addicted or stopped her from quitting,
14:51:26
because we know she can quit.
14:51:29
We know that the companies cooperated.  Lorillard
14:51:33
and Philip Morris did.  We've got an internal memo from the
14:51:36
'60s where Reynolds says let's work on the safer
14:51:41
cigarette program, push the cooperation with the
14:51:43
government.
14:51:44
And one last thing on design.  Dr. Cummings
14:51:46
admitted that the companies were trying to make safer
14:51:50
cigarettes.  And after the government safer cigarette
14:51:54
program disbanded, that continued.  And look what Reynolds
14:51:57
did.  They made a cigarette called Premier that only heated
14:52:00
tobacco and didn't burn it.
14:52:01
And this is not a secret tobacco company document.
14:52:05
It's a secret government document that came out of
14:52:07
litigation.  Preliminary research conducted by the
    79
14:52:10
 1
developer showed there were fewer carcinogens in Premier.
14:52:15
 2
Right off the bat, Dr. Cummings said it was a
14:52:17
 3
safer cigarette and that it did have less carcinogens
14:52:20
 4
because it didn't burn tobacco at all.
14:52:23
 5
Look at what the government said about this
14:52:25
 6
cigarette that was developed by a tobacco company to be
14:52:28
 7
safer.  Look what they were concerned about.
14:52:33
 8
The panel was concerned about the ramifications of
14:52:35
 9
a cigarette that is actually safer.  Actually safer.  The
14:52:42
government was worried that R.J. Reynolds had developed a
14:52:47
cigarette that was actually safer.
14:52:49
Was Reynolds engaged in deliberate wrongdoing when
14:52:55
they made a cigarette that was actually safer, a cigarette
14:52:57
that the government attacked?  Was Lorillard and Philip
14:53:00
Morris engaged in deliberate wrongdoing when they sent
14:53:02
their top scientists for ten years to work hand in hand
14:53:06
with the government to design cigarettes, only to have them
14:53:09
pull out a '76 document from Lorillard or a '73 document
14:53:13
from Reynolds and say, oh, you were researching the wrong
14:53:16
things?
14:53:16
When we know, and Dr. Cummings admitted, that the
14:53:20
government's National Cancer Institute less hazardous
14:53:24
cigarette program was behind in endorsing that kind of
14:53:27
research.
14:53:30
Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Burkhart hasn't proved
    80
14:53:31
 1
that she is entitled to get the bonus award of punitive
14:53:38
 2
damages.
14:53:39
 3
Look what the government did when they found out
14:53:41
 4
that there was a safer cigarette that cut the risk of
14:53:43
 5
cancer.  They said, shouldn't wait for the scientists to
14:53:46
 6
complete research.  Research should continue.
14:53:47
 7
But look at that last sentence.  There's no need
14:53:50
 8
to wait to initiate a war, a war against new tobacco
14:53:55
 9
products.
14:53:56
This is the government's record.  This isn't a
14:54:00
tobacco company spokesman.  The government thought they
14:54:05
were making safer cigarettes.
14:54:07
Dr. Cummings had absolutely no explanation of why
14:54:09
the government shut down the program where the companies
14:54:13
worked with them to design.  He had no explanation why the
14:54:15
government would be more scared about a cigarette that's
14:54:18
safer.  He didn't say a thing about that.
14:54:21
So they say that filters are fraudulent.  They say
14:54:26
that the companies deliberately and wrongfully sold
14:54:30
filters.  There wasn't any evidence.  But, ladies and
14:54:34
gentlemen, what Dr. -- I believe it was Dr. Proctor,
14:54:36
admitted is that the Surgeon General actually was looking
14:54:40
at the effect on actual people.
14:54:42
They looked at the people who smoked filters.  And
14:54:45
they looked at the people who smoked what they called low
    81
14:54:48
 1
yield, low tar, low nicotine.  And they tracked their
14:54:51
 2
cancer dates or their cancer rates.
14:54:55
 3
And so they could figure out, wait a second, are
14:54:57
 4
filters actually working?  Are the people who smoked
14:54:59
 5
filters getting lower rates of disease?
14:55:01
 6
I don't have to go into the tobacco company files.
14:55:04
 7
Let's just look at what the Surgeon General said when the
14:55:08
 8
companies like the companies here were making filters.
14:55:11
 9
'79.  She's smoking filters, Mrs. Burkhart.  The
14:55:16
Surgeon General's report says the people who use -- use of
14:55:19
filter cigarettes and smoking of cigarettes with lower
14:55:22
amounts of tar decrease lung cancer mortality rates.
14:55:27
That's real people, real death rates, and a real
14:55:30
benefit.  How is that fraud?  How is that fraud?
14:55:38
In '81, again, today's filter-tipped, lower tar
14:55:42
and nicotine cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer.
14:55:45
It's not a trick.  It's what the Surgeon General
14:55:46
found when he actually measured the lung cancer rates.
14:55:50
So, you know, Mr. Heimann can pull out a document
14:55:53
that says, oh, the illusion of filtration.  Or he can pull
14:55:57
out a document that Dr. Proctor showed you that said let's
14:55:59
change the color of a filter.  And then Dr. Proctor had to
14:56:02
admit it never even happened.
14:56:03
But if you want to know if filters are really
14:56:06
safer and you want to know whether the companies were doing
    82
14:56:09
 1
something wrong at the time, look at what the Surgeon
14:56:11
 2
General said.
14:56:12
 3
Filters, they believed, based on real data for
14:56:16
 4
real smokers, were decreasing death rates.
14:56:19
 5
That's not fraud, ladies and gentlemen.  That's
14:56:21
 6
not wrongdoing.  And none of it had anything to do with
14:56:26
 7
Mrs. Burkhart.
14:56:26
 8
1989, the same thing.  Reduces the risk of lung
14:56:30
 9
cancer.
14:56:30
1990, when they observed smokers of filtered
14:56:35
cigarettes, they find a lower risk of lung cancer.
14:56:38
How is that fraud?  How did they show -- does this
14:56:42
make any sense?  Would the companies want to kill their own
14:56:45
customers?  Would the companies engage in wrongdoing if
14:56:49
they're going to spend all this money to make a safer
14:56:51
cigarette that the government tries to shut down?  Would
14:56:56
the companies be engaged in wrongdoing if they're working
14:56:59
for ten years on published safer cigarette research, and
14:57:01
the tobacco companies are the ones that are doing it, and
14:57:04
the government shuts it down?
14:57:06
MR. HEIMANN:  Not really.  There's no evidence of
14:57:07
this.  This is -- he is coming up with --
14:57:10
THE COURT:  I have to sustain it.  I'm sorry.
14:57:13
The standard I've given you under the legal
14:57:15
instructions, which I think counsel is trying to change, is
    83
14:57:19
 1
punitive damages.  This is on instruction number 17.
14:57:23
 2
Punitive damages are warranted if you find the
14:57:26
 3
plaintiff has proved by clear and convincing evidence that
14:57:28
 4
the defendant had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of
14:57:31
 5
its conduct.
14:57:33
 6
I remind you here that wrongfulness of its conduct
14:57:36
 7
has already been determined by the Engle jury.  After
14:57:40
 8
listening to more than a year's worth of evidence, I'm not
14:57:44
 9
putting you through that burden.
14:57:56
        The Engle jury has already decided that, including 
14:57:56
the withholding of information about the effectiveness, 
14:57:56
according to their own research, of filters and/or  
14:57:55
perforated filters and/or menthol. 
14:57:59
The Engle jury already decided the wrongfulness.
14:58:05
To the extent he's arguing that it was not wrongful
14:58:08
conduct, he can't do that.  I'm sorry.
14:58:12
The burden here on the plaintiff and the issue
14:58:15
here for you to decide on punitive damages is whether
14:58:18
they've proved by clear and convincing evidence that the
14:58:20
defendant had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness, the
14:58:26
defendant had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness.  The
14:58:29
Engle jury has already said it was wrongful.
14:58:32
The question is whether they had actual knowledge
14:58:34
of the wrongfulness and that there was a high probability
14:58:39
of injury or damage and despite that knowledge
    84
14:58:43
 1
intentionally pursued that course of conduct resulting in
14:58:47
 2
the plaintiff's injuries.  That's the issue.
14:58:50
 3
Were they aware of the wrongfulness, not whether
14:58:53
 4
the wrongfulness occurred and, therefore, I have to strike
14:58:57
 5
those portions where he's simply arguing there was no
14:59:00
 6
wrongful conduct.  The Engle jury has already decided that
14:59:03
 7
for us.
14:59:03
 8
But the plaintiff's burden is actual knowledge of
14:59:06
 9
the wrongfulness and despite high probability of injury and
14:59:13
despite that knowledge pursued the course resulting in the
14:59:16
plaintiff's injuries.  That's the standard.  I have to
14:59:19
remind the jury of that.
14:59:21
MR. HEIMANN:  And Your Honor, he's almost two
14:59:22
hours now.  I would ask --
14:59:25
MR. BELASIC:  I'm finishing up, Your Honor.
14:59:27
THE COURT:  No.  I'm not going to limit him, nor
14:59:29
will I limit you.
14:59:30
MR. BELASIC:  As Judge Jones read to you -- and
14:59:31
you can read in black and white -- the instruction says
14:59:34
that Mrs. Burkhart has to prove actual knowledge of
14:59:36
wrongdoing.  We've reviewed the evidence of what the
14:59:39
companies knew and what the companies did.  You'll
14:59:42
determine whether it was actual knowledge of wrongdoing
14:59:44
under these circumstances.
14:59:46
But also as Judge Jones said, you have to
    85
14:59:48
 1
determine whether the companies then intentionally followed
14:59:51
 2
a course of conduct that they knew was wrongful and that it
14:59:56
 3
caused an injury to Mrs. Burkhart.  That's why I'm
15:00:00
 4
reviewing that evidence.  You will decide.
15:00:05
 5
And what I suggest to you is that based on the
15:00:07
 6
evidence from Dr. Proctor and from Dr. Cummings, the
15:00:09
 7
evidence admitting cooperation with the government and the
15:00:12
 8
evidence that did not link any of this conduct to
15:00:16
 9
Mrs. Burkhart -- and after all, that's why we're here.
15:00:18
That's the only reason we're here -- that she is not
15:00:22
entitled to punitive damages.  And so you should vote no on
15:00:25
that final question.  
15:00:26
Now, I'll leave you with this.  At the end of the
15:00:32
day Mrs. Burkhart was a heavy smoker.  And at the end of
15:00:35
the day Mrs. Burkhart chose once to stop in the 1980s.  And
15:00:40
at the end of the day she chose once to quit for good in
15:00:43
1994.
15:00:43
And if it wasn't for a lawsuit, we would say that
15:00:47
that was a smoker who could control her behavior and who
15:00:50
quit for good by her own words.  But because this is a
15:00:55
lawsuit, plaintiffs argue, well, they have somehow proven
15:00:59
that addiction was the substantial cause.  We know that the
15:01:03
only time she put her mind to it, she could quit.  And
15:01:08
addiction didn't stop her.
15:01:09
It's not something that a company made up.  She is
    86
15:01:12
 1
not a desperate smoker who tried to quit in the '50s or
15:01:16
 2
'60s.  She did not; made no effort.  She isn't a
15:01:21
 3
desperate smoker who was being warned every day by her
15:01:24
 4
husband that it would kill her.  She's not somebody like
15:01:27
 5
that.  She's someone who is being warned by her husband it
15:01:29
 6
could kill her but wasn't doing anything at all to quit in
15:01:32
 7
the '70s.
15:01:33
 8
She says she only -- the first time she ever tried
15:01:37
 9
to quit was the '80s, quit for three weeks.  By the
15:01:40
'90s, smoking the same brand, same nicotine.  She was
15:01:43
smoking more than before.  If she was addicted, Dr. Burns
15:01:47
says she was at her peak of addiction.
15:01:50
And when she changed her mind, she changed her
15:01:52
life.  And when she made the decision, she no longer
15:01:55
smoked.
15:01:57
Ladies and gentlemen, under those circumstances,
15:01:59
even if smoking is the medical cause, addiction cannot be a
15:02:03
legal cause of a person who knows the risk of smoking and
15:02:07
who chooses to smoke and then chooses to quit successfully
15:02:12
the very first time they put their mind to it.
15:02:15
It's been a long trial.  And I think this is the
15:02:17
last time I'll get a chance to talk to you.  One thing that
15:02:21
I wanted to tell you is, I know by now, I said for some of
15:02:27
you, it was an inconvenience; for others, it would be a
15:02:31
sacrifice.  I know by now it's a sacrifice for every one of
    87
15:02:34
 1
you.  You don't take nine days out of your life to decide a
15:02:37
 2
civil dispute without it being a sacrifice.  And, again, I
15:02:40
 3
know you were drafted.  Everybody else volunteered.
15:02:43
 4
So I thank you for your tremendous attention, and
15:02:45
 5
I thank you for your service.


CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE 
15:22:16
 7
MR. ROWLEY:  Good afternoon, everybody.
15:22:18
 8
Mr. Belasic just covered a whole lot of ground.
15:22:20
 9
I'm not going to repeat the things that he told you.  I
15:22:22
will tell you that I agreed with all of them.
15:22:24
But today, I want to focus with my limited time,
15:22:27
as Judge Jones said, on issues that are a little bit more
15:22:31
specific to Lorillard, and I will be brief.
15:22:33
So I want to start by reminding you of some of the
15:22:40
facts that are related to Mrs. Burkhart's smoking history
15:22:43
in relation specifically to Lorillard.
15:22:45
The only Lorillard product that Mrs. Burkhart
15:22:47
smoked was Kent, Kent cigarettes.  She started smoking
15:22:51
them, she says, in 1965, and she says she stopped smoking
15:22:55
them in 1974.  After 1974, she never did smoke any other
15:23:05
Lorillard brand.  That's the entire span of her Lorillard
15:23:07
smoking.
15:23:08
In 1965, when she started smoking Kent,
15:23:13
Mrs. Burkhart was 24 years old.  She was married to her
15:23:19
first husband.  She had already moved from home.  They
    91
15:23:21
 1
moved out of town and then back to Kentucky.
15:23:23
 2
And she was certainly old enough at that time, at
15:23:29
 3
the time she started smoking Kent, to make an adult
15:23:32
 4
decision to smoke.  Mrs. Burkhart was already smoking
15:23:38
 5
filtered cigarettes at the time she switched to Kent
15:23:42
 6
cigarettes.
15:23:42
 7
And you heard her testimony -- and Mr. Belasic
15:23:47
 8
referred to it briefly -- that the reason that she switched
15:23:51
 9
was that she believed that Kents tasted better.  That was
15:23:55
her motivation for switching.  And when she tried them, she
15:24:00
found that they actually did taste better.  And her sworn
15:24:03
testimony -- you saw it on video -- was that she wasn't
15:24:06
even thinking about Kent as being safer at the time that
15:24:11
she switched to Kent.  Now, that was in her deposition.  
15:24:15
When she came in and you saw her testify live here
15:24:18
at trial, she said something about the companies not
15:24:22
working to improve their products or take stuff, I think
15:24:26
she said, out of the cigarettes.
15:24:28
But you folks saw the testimony of Dr. Proctor.
15:24:32
Remember, he was the second witness who you saw.  And he
15:24:35
described all of the efforts, many of the efforts that
15:24:39
Lorillard made during this precise time period to improve
15:24:43
its products, to identify potentially harmful components in
15:24:48
the smoke.
15:24:49
Lorillard's work with some of the leading
    92
15:24:52
 1
scientists of the day, remember, these folks were described
15:24:56
 2
as giants in American public health.  During my
15:25:00
 3
cross-examination, he said that they were the leading
15:25:03
 4
figures in public health.  Towering figures, in fact, is
15:25:08
 5
what he called them.
15:25:09
 6
So some of the things that Dr. Proctor described
15:25:12
 7
were that Lorillard identified what he called then phenolic
15:25:17
 8
compounds.  Remember the discussion of ciliostasis, the
15:25:20
 9
hair cells in the lung.  That was the predominant theory of
15:25:24
lung disease at the time.
15:25:25
So Lorillard collaborated with scientists,
15:25:29
Dr. Dietrich Hoffmann, who was at Sloan-Kettering Medical
15:25:33
Center, to try to identify and isolate these then phenolic
15:25:37
compounds, and then Lorillard developed for Kent the filter
15:25:44
that filtered out phenols.
15:25:46
So when Mrs. Burkhart said that she thought
15:25:49
Lorillard and the other companies were working on this, she
15:25:52
was right.  They were working on it.  And you heard this
15:25:55
testimony directly from Dr. Proctor during his
15:25:57
cross-examination.  That's not the only thing that he told
15:26:01
you about.
15:26:03
Can you pull up --
15:26:09
Okay.  If you'll remember, this is one of the
15:26:12
first exhibits that the plaintiff's lawyers used in the
15:26:15
case.  This is the "Life" magazine article relating to the
    93
15:26:18
 1
mouse skin painting studies.  And remember, Dr. Proctor
15:26:21
 2
told you that it was Lorillard who sought out Dr. Graham
15:26:26
 3
and Dr. Wynder after their publication of the first
15:26:29
 4
epidemiologic study that showed a relationship between
15:26:32
 5
smoking and lung cancer and offered to help them.
15:26:34
 6
Now, that is not reprehensible conduct.  It's not
15:26:40
 7
punishable conduct.  And it doesn't show an intent to harm
15:26:44
 8
or an intent to harm consumers.  He reached out to them,
15:26:46
 9
provided them with hundreds of cigarettes for these
15:26:49
studies.  And Dr. Proctor told you that this help lasted
15:26:54
for decades.  In fact, Lorillard provided these scientists
15:26:57
with cigarettes, both before and after this "Life" magazine
15:27:02
article.
15:27:02
And he told you about all the other efforts, many
15:27:04
of the other efforts that Lorillard made during this time
15:27:09
period before the Kent cigarette was introduced, these
15:27:12
efforts to make the Kent filter, like PMO.  You may have
15:27:17
made a note about PMO during the trial when Dr. Proctor
15:27:21
testified, trying to reduce ciliostasis, trying to remove
15:27:27
phenols, trying to remove potentially harmful constituents
15:27:31
in cigarette smoke.
15:27:32
I want to talk just for a minute about this
15:27:36
allegation that the companies did things to try to make
15:27:40
cigarettes more addictive.  And Mr. Belasic covered aspects
15:27:45
of it.
    94
15:27:47
 1
And remember, he said that these -- these efforts
15:27:50
 2
were in response to public health recommendations,
15:27:54
 3
including recommendations from the National Cancer
15:27:55
 4
Institute.  But it was also recommended by the Surgeon
15:27:59
 5
General of the United States.
15:28:01
 6
Remember the plaintiff's lawyer showed you
15:28:03
 7
documents that talked about nicotine addiction and changing
15:28:08
 8
smoke pH and filter ventilation, things like that.
15:28:13
 9
I wanted to show you one Lorillard document,
15:28:16
because Lorillard's program, as I think Dr. Cummings
15:28:21
mentioned, Lorillard's program to follow these public
15:28:24
health recommendations was called the nicotine augmentation
15:28:26
project.
15:28:27
The document I'm going to show you was admitted by
15:28:30
the plaintiff's lawyers.  It's the first document, the
15:28:33
seminal document in the program.  And it explains exactly
15:28:37
why they were pursuing this research and who recommended
15:28:41
this research.
15:28:41
Can we put that up, please?
15:28:46
This is from May of 1976.  So it's within days of
15:28:53
the NCI Tobacco Working Group recommendation that
15:28:56
Mr. Belasic showed you.
15:28:57
The very first sentence of the very first
15:29:02
paragraph that established this program -- and the snippets
15:29:07
that the plaintiff's lawyer read to you came from this
    95
15:29:10
 1
document and other documents that were part of this
15:29:12
 2
program.
15:29:12
 3
The first sentence says, recommendations from
15:29:15
 4
health-oriented agencies and pressures from competitive
15:29:19
 5
companies make it imperative that Lorillard develop a
15:29:23
 6
flavorful cigarette delivering lower tar, while at the same
15:29:27
 7
time delivering a level of nicotine higher than could be
15:29:30
 8
obtained by normal conventional cigarette construction.
15:29:35
 9
That's the very first sentence.
15:29:37
The contemporaneous documents say that this work
15:29:41
was an attempt to make a safer cigarette.  That's the
15:29:46
purpose of the work.  And Lorillard's documents at the time
15:29:50
reflect it.
15:29:59
All right.  Mr. Belasic talked with you a little
15:30:02
bit about damages.  And I agree with him that you should
15:30:05
not reach the issue of damages in this case.
15:30:07
But the Court's instruction was that damages must
15:30:13
be fair and just.  There's nothing in the instructions
15:30:20
about giving an award that's shocking.  The award, if you
15:30:25
reach that question and if you were to award damages, must
15:30:29
be fair and just.
15:30:30
The number that Mr. Heimann gave you, $10 million,
15:30:33
is shocking.  A fair and just award, if Mrs. Burkhart could
15:30:40
meet her burden in showing that she was addicted to
15:30:45
nicotine, and in showing that nicotine was a cause of her
    96
15:30:49
 1
injuries, and meet all of her other burdens, a fair and
15:30:53
 2
just award would be one where you would take a zero off the
15:30:57
 3
number that Mr. Heimann suggested.
15:31:00
 4
Only if Mrs. Burkhart could meet her burdens.  And
15:31:06
 5
we don't believe that she can for the reasons that
15:31:08
 6
Mr. Belasic explained.
15:31:10
 7
So one other topic regarding Lorillard that I want
15:31:15
 8
to talk with you about.
15:31:16
 9
Mr. Heimann talked with you a little bit about
15:31:19
marketing.  You heard testimony about Lorillard's
15:31:23
marketing, in particular, from both Dr. Cummings, one of
15:31:27
the plaintiff's experts, and Dr. Proctor, one of the
15:31:29
plaintiff's experts.
15:31:30
And both of those folks told you that Lorillard
15:31:34
Tobacco Company had a policy that dated back decades, more
15:31:38
than 40 years, against placing products in movies and
15:31:44
films.
15:31:44
It was the first thing, in fact, that I asked
15:31:47
Dr. Proctor about.
15:31:48
And they not only had that policy, when they were
15:31:51
solicited by agencies and producers, they rejected those
15:31:58
solicitations.
15:31:59
Many of the things that Mr. Heimann talked about
15:32:11
as being reprehensible or evidence of bad intent were
15:32:16
actually efforts to make a safer cigarette.  And
    97
15:32:22
 1
Lorillard's nicotine augmentation program is just one
15:32:25
 2
example.
15:32:27
 3
So I am out of time.  I want to thank you for your
15:32:29
 4
service in this case.  I appreciate it very much.  And
15:32:33
 5
Lorillard also appreciates it.  Thank you.


CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE 
15:32:51
 8
MS. GALLAGHER:  Good afternoon, ladies and
15:32:51
 9
gentlemen.  
15:32:52
As the judge has instructed you, the plaintiff has
15:32:54
to prove every essential element of her claims in this
15:32:57
case, and she's got to do that by a preponderance of the
15:32:59
evidence.
15:33:00
And you have an instruction on that.  But it's not
15:33:04
just that it has to be a preponderance of the evidence, it
15:33:07
has to be the credible and believable evidence.
15:33:11
As you will see when you look through your
15:33:13
instructions, you actually have three different
15:33:15
instructions on credibility of the witnesses.  That's how
15:33:19
important it is.
15:33:21
And that's what I want to spend my brief time with
15:33:23
you today talking about.
15:33:26
One of the instructions you have goes to the
15:33:30
credibility of experts.
15:33:40
Can you get it?
    98
15:33:42
 1
There we go.
15:33:53
 2
And you'll see these.  You've got these.
15:33:55
 3
When a witness is being paid for reviewing and
15:33:57
 4
testifying concerning the evidence, you may consider the
15:34:01
 5
possibility of bias, and you may view with caution the
15:34:05
 6
testimony of such witness where court testimony is given
15:34:08
 7
with regularity and represents a significant portion of the
15:34:12
 8
witness' income.
15:34:13

Well, you know that the plaintiff's experts,
15:34:18
Drs. Cummings, Burns, and Proctor, have testified with
15:34:24
great regularity.  Dr. Cummings has testified in 60 to 70
15:34:29
trials, Dr. Proctor in over 30 trials, Dr. Burns in 40 to
15:34:36
50 trials.
15:34:37
Between them, these three experts, in the last
15:34:39
five years, have testified in over 150 trials like this.
15:34:45
And that doesn't count the amount of time they spend
15:34:48
reviewing records, giving depositions, and writing reports.
15:34:52
The other thing that you can consider is whether
15:34:56
these experts make a significant portion of their income
15:34:59
from testifying.  And you know from listening to the
15:35:03
cross-examinations of these witnesses that each one of them
15:35:06
have become millionaires by testifying in this litigation.
15:35:10
And, in fact, they are actually making more and
15:35:15
more money as the years go by.
15:35:20
Dr. Cummings made well over half of his income
    99
15:35:23
 1
last year testifying in tobacco cases.
15:35:28
 2
Dr. Proctor said last year that he earned almost
15:35:31
 3
half a million dollars.  And this year he will earn more
15:35:34
 4
than that.
15:35:36
 5
And Dr. Burns makes 90 percent of his income
15:35:40
 6
testifying in cases just like this.
15:35:43
 7
So should you view their testimony with an eye as
15:35:49
 8
to whether they are biased?  Well, you don't even have to
15:35:53
 9
wonder about that because they've told you they are.
15:35:57
Dr. Cummings is the general in the war against
15:35:59
tobacco.  And you have Dr. Proctor, who thinks that
15:36:03
shocking, large verdicts act as a tax on cigarettes,
15:36:09
cigarettes that he wants banned.
15:36:12
These experts have an agenda.  And it really
15:36:15
doesn't have anything to do with the specific plaintiff, a
15:36:21
plaintiff like Mrs. Burkhart.  They're here for other
15:36:24
reasons.
15:36:24
And they didn't tell you much about Mrs. Burkhart.
15:36:31
You heard very, very little about Mrs. Burkhart from those
15:36:33
experts, the very person that this case is about.
15:36:39
So what other evidence did the plaintiff bring
15:36:41
you?  The plaintiff brought you Mrs. Burkhart, the smoker
15:36:44
in this case, to tell you about the decisions she made,
15:36:48
what she heard, and the decisions she made about her own
15:36:51
smoking.
   100
15:36:53
 1
And then we brought you her husband, the man who
15:36:58
 2
has known her for 40 years.
15:37:01
 3
And you have another instruction on the
15:37:03
 4
credibility of other witnesses.  And it says, when I say
15:37:12
 5
you must consider all the evidence, I don't mean that you
15:37:15
 6
must accept all the evidence as true or accurate.  You
15:37:19
 7
should decide whether you believe what each witness had to
15:37:24
 8
say and how important that testimony was.  In making that
15:37:28
 9
decision, you may believe or disbelieve any witness in
15:37:33
whole or in part.
15:37:37
So let's review what you have heard about some of
15:37:40
the key issues in this case.
15:37:45
The plaintiffs want you to believe that
15:37:48
Mrs. Burkhart smoked filtered cigarettes because she
15:37:50
thought they were safer.  The evidence that you heard from
15:37:56
Mrs. Burkhart was that when she went to Kent filtered
15:38:00
cigarettes, she chose a filtered cigarette because it kept
15:38:03
the tobacco out of her mouth.
15:38:05
She specifically said that she did not switch to
15:38:10
Kent cigarettes because she thought they were safer, that
15:38:13
she thought they were better for her health.
15:38:15
But then she said she switched to filters because
15:38:20
filters reduced nicotine and tar, because they were better
15:38:25
for her.
15:38:26
So you had every bit of testimony from, no, I
   101
15:38:29
 1
switched to them because they kept tobacco out of my teeth,
15:38:33
 2
to I switched to them because I thought they were better
15:38:36
 3
for me.
15:38:36
 4
Well, keep in mind when Mrs. Burkhart switched to
15:38:40
 5
filtered cigarettes, because that was in 1960.  And if you
15:38:46
 6
think that she switched to filtered cigarettes in the 1960s
15:38:49
 7
because she thought they were safer, then she had to know
15:38:54
 8
that smoking was dangerous in the 1960s.
15:38:59
 9
And what did she tell you about that?  When she
15:39:01
was on the witness stand here in this courtroom, she told
15:39:04
you that she did not know that there were any health risks
15:39:07
associated with smoking until the 1980s.
15:39:10
And then she also told you that if she had known
15:39:15
in the 1960s or the 1970s that cigarettes caused disease or
15:39:21
were addictive, that she would have tried to quit sooner.
15:39:27
But then she also told you that she knew she was
15:39:30
addicted in the 1960s, that she used the term "nicotine
15:39:35
fit" to refer to her own smoking in the 1960s.
15:39:38
And you heard from Mr. Burkhart.  Mr. Burkhart
15:39:42
said that he and Mrs. Burkhart had conversations about
15:39:46
smoking, about the health risks of smoking, that smoking
15:39:50
could be dangerous for you, that smoking could be bad for
15:39:52
your lungs, that smoking could kill you, back in the 1970s
15:39:57
when they first met, in 1974.
15:40:02
But then Mr. Burkhart said, no, no.  Those
   102
15:40:05
 1
conversations were actually later that I had with my wife,
15:40:10
 2
that smoking could kill you.
15:40:12
 3
So if you believe the testimony of the Burkharts,
15:40:16
 4
then you have to believe that Mrs. Burkhart was first aware
15:40:19
 5
of the health risks of smoking in the 1960s, that she was
15:40:25
 6
first aware of the health risks of smoking in the 1970s,
15:40:29
 7
and that she was first aware of the health risks of smoking
15:40:32
 8
in the 1980s.
15:40:33
 9
Mr. Heimann has also said that Mrs. Burkhart
15:40:40
smoked light cigarettes or low tar cigarettes because she
15:40:46
thought that they were safer for her, that she thought that
15:40:50
they were better for her.
15:40:51
But when Mrs. Burkhart was asked about her switch
15:40:55
to Kools, which would have been the first light cigarette
15:40:59
that she smoked, she said she switched to them because they
15:41:03
were menthol; that she had a cold and her friend said, try
15:41:07
a menthol cigarette, and that's when she picked up her
15:41:10
first light cigarette.
15:41:11
She told you that she smoked her second light
15:41:14
cigarette, the second brand, Virginia Slims Lights, because
15:41:19
she was trying to get off the menthol from the Kools
15:41:22
lights.
15:41:23
She also told you that she never compared tar
15:41:27
amounts between cigarettes.  And she told you that she
15:41:33
never chose a brand based on the tar levels.
   103
15:41:37
 1
So Mrs. Burkhart told you that she chose low tar
15:41:41
 2
cigarettes because of the low tar; she thought they were
15:41:46
 3
better for her.  And yet at the same time she told you that
15:41:50
 4
she never chose a brand of cigarettes based on the level of
15:41:53
 5
tar.
15:41:53
 6
I add, Mrs. Burkhart told you that she picked
15:42:03
 7
Virginia Slims because of the ad campaign, you've come a
15:42:05
 8
long way, baby.  She started smoking Virginia Slims in
15:42:09
 9
1980 -- 1980s, somewhere around the mid 1980s.
15:42:14
And as you've heard from Dr. Cummings, you've come
15:42:16
a long way, baby, that ad campaign started in the late
15:42:20
1960s, some 15 years before she ever tried a Virginia Slims
15:42:25
cigarette.
15:42:25
Mr. Burkhart also talked to you about ads.  He
15:42:28
said that the reason he and Mrs. Burkhart switched to light
15:42:33
cigarettes was because of TV ads they saw in the 1980s and
15:42:36
the 1990s.
15:42:38
And you know that's impossible, because there
15:42:41
haven't been TV ads for cigarettes since 1971.
15:42:45
The last one I'll give you -- and I know a lot of
15:42:52
you have been taking notes and you've probably got notes of
15:42:55
your own on some of these topics.
15:42:58
Let's talk about the 1985 warning.  Mrs. Burkhart
15:43:00
told you that she never saw the 1985 warning on emphysema,
15:43:05
that she couldn't read it because the print was too little.
   104
15:43:08
 1
But then she also told you if she had seen that
15:43:11
 2
emphysema warning, she would have stopped and thought about
15:43:16
 3
it.
15:43:16
 4
And then you heard from Mr. Burkhart who said they
15:43:20
 5
had very specific conversations about the 1985 warnings.
15:43:25
 6
And he told you that Mrs. Burkhart believed the 1985
15:43:32
 7
warnings.  And then Mr. Burkhart told you Mrs. Burkhart did
15:43:37
 8
not believe the 1985 warnings.
15:43:40
 9
So if you believe the Burkharts, Mrs. Burkhart
15:43:45
never saw the warning about emphysema, or she had a very
15:43:53
specific conversation with her husband about it and she
15:43:56
either believed or didn't believe that warning.
15:44:00
You decide whether you believe what each witness
15:44:14
had to say.  Those are in the judge's instructions.  And
15:44:16
you may believe or disbelieve any witness in whole or in
15:44:19
part.
15:44:19
And if you decide to believe the Burkharts, you've
15:44:22
got to believe absolutely contradictory evidence.
15:44:26
And a third instruction you have from Judge Jones
15:44:31
about the credibility of witnesses is whether those
15:44:34
witnesses have changed their testimony on important
15:44:38
matters.  And that is something that you need to consider.
15:44:43
Because if you go by the evidence that the
15:44:46
plaintiffs brought you on important issues, like, did
15:44:50
Mrs. Burkhart know about the health risks of smoking in the
   105
15:44:54
 1
1960s, the answer is yes and the answer is no.
15:45:00
 2
If you go by the evidence the plaintiffs brought
15:45:03
 3
you about whether Mrs. Burkhart saw warnings and paid
15:45:05
 4
attention to them, the answer is yes and the answer is no.
15:45:11
 5
If Mrs. Burkhart relied on ads in choosing a brand
15:45:15
 6
of cigarettes, the answer is yes and the answer is no.
15:45:19
 7
All of these important issues have both yeses and
15:45:25
 8
noes as the answer.  And that is not clear, credible,
15:45:30
 9
preponderance of the evidence proving the elements,
15:45:32
essential elements of the plaintiff's claims.
15:45:37
What facts are clear, that Mrs. Burkhart believes
15:45:39
that smoking is an individual choice, that Mrs. Burkhart
15:45:44
believes the cure for smoking addiction is to quit.  And
15:45:51
that when Mrs. Burkhart made up her mind to quit, she did
15:45:55
so.  There are no yeses or noes, no maybes on those facts.
15:45:59
Those facts are undisputed.
15:46:00
Mrs. Burkhart's smoking decisions were her own.
15:46:05
And that's why addiction was not the legal cause of her
15:46:12
COPD.
15:46:13
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your
15:46:15
attention over the last week and today.  And thank you for
15:46:19
your jury service.
