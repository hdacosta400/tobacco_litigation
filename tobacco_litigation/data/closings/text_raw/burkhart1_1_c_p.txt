MR. HEIMANN: May it please the Court.
Good morning once again, ladies and gentlemen. In
a little while, probably in the middle of the afternoon or so
when we've all got done talking to you, you will go back into
your room and you will begin your deliberations; and when you
do that, you will have three jobs to do. The first will be
to answer the questions on the Verdict Form that His Honor
will give you.
The second will be to follow the instructions on
the law that His Honor gives you with respect to the
questions on that Verdict Form.
And third will be to explain to each other why you
believe the answers should be what you think they are.
And that last point is important, because you're a
jury of eight persons; and in order to return a verdict in
this case, you all have to agree as to each of the questions
on the Verdict Form and as to the ultimate verdict.
10:13:35
10:13:40
10:13:42
10:13:42
10:13:45
10:14:02
10:14:04
10:14:04
10:14:05
10:14:08
10:14:11
10:14:14
10:14:19
10:14:23
10:14:31
10:14:36
10:14:38
10:14:42
10:14:46
10:14:48
10:14:55
10:14:59
10:15:03
10:15:08
10:15:12
55 So it will be necessary for you to explain to each
other why you think the answer should be one way or the other
for each of those questions and why you think the verdict in
the end should be what you think it is.
So what I'm about here this morning is to try and
give you some ways to go about thinking about the issues in
this case. I'm not, by the way, going to try and marshal the
evidence. Sometimes we see that on television or in the
movies about trials. That's not something I will do here.
I will make reference to the evidence, but I'm not
going to try and put it all back. You've heard all the
testimony and so forth. I'm not going to go back into all
that testimony, but I am going to try and explain to you why
we believe your answers to those Verdict Form questions
should be in favor of Mrs. Burkhart and why your verdict in
the end in this case should be in favor of Mrs. Burkhart.
So at the heart of this case is the following
question, really: When large corporations, powerful
corporations abuse their power, use their money and resources
to lie about the safety of the products they make and sell,
to conceal the dangers in those products from the people who
use them, all for the greed for money and all the while
knowing that doing that is going to cost millions to suffer,
do they bear some responsibility for the harm that they
inflict on people like Mrs. Burkhart, some responsibility for
10:15:15
10:15:19
10:15:24
10:15:26
10:15:28
10:15:33
10:15:39
10:15:42
10:15:45
10:15:49
10:15:51
10:15:54
10:15:56
10:16:00
10:16:04
10:16:07
10:16:09
10:16:15
10:16:21
10:16:25
10:16:30
10:16:35
10:16:41
10:16:53
10:16:58
56 that harm?
Now, we accept -- Ms. London told you at the
opening statement we accept that Mrs. Burkhart bears some
responsibility, even though -- and I'll come to this in a
minute -- she was addicted to the cigarettes manufactured by
these defendants, but she still bears some responsibility for
her own actions. We don't deny that.
Defendants, on the other hand, deny any and all
responsibility for the consequences of their action. So
that's the real question at the heart of this case for you to
decide. Do they bear some responsibility for the injuries
and suffering that Mrs. Burkhart has as a result of cigarette
smoking?
Let me start -- burden of proof. His Honor has
already talked with you about this, but I'd like to start out
a little bit more with this. This is the burden of proof
that we bear on most of the questions that will be put to you
on the Verdict Form; and that is to establish our claims, we
need to prove those claims by a preponderance of the
evidence, which really means simply that it's more likely
true than not, more likely right than wrong. Even if only by
a little bit, that's the burden that we bear on most of the
claims in this case.
You may in the end have some doubt about the
evidence in the case. You may have doubt both ways about the
10:17:05
10:17:06
10:17:10
10:17:13
10:17:18
10:17:20
10:17:24
10:17:30
10:17:33
10:17:37
10:17:40
10:17:45
10:17:53
10:17:53
10:18:04
10:18:06
10:18:10
10:18:13
10:18:19
10:18:21
10:18:24
10:18:30
10:18:34
10:18:34
10:18:46
57 evidence in the case, but your responsibility is to weigh the
evidence; and if you find even by a little bit that the
evidence favors Mrs. Burkhart's claims, then your verdict
should be in favor of Mrs. Burkhart.
So if in the course of your deliberations one of
you says, "Look, I've got some doubts about this. I'm not
absolutely sure about how the evidence is," you've got to
tell that juror, "No, you don't have to be certain." This is
not a case where you have to be certain. This is where you
simply have to believe and conclude that the evidence, more
likely than not, is in favor of Mrs. Burkhart.
The first issue -- and we've heard this from the
judge now on numerous occasions. The first issue for you to
decide this case is whether or not Mrs. Burkhart is a member
of the Engle class.
Now, to be clear about this, the Engle class
doesn't include all smokers in Florida who suffered injuries.
The Engle class is quite narrow, actually. For the most
part, it only includes folks who began smoking in the 1940s
and the 1950s, people who typically were born in the 1930s
and the 1940s, like Mrs. Burkhart.
So we're not talking about people who took up
smoking in the 1970s or the 1980s. We're talking about
people who took up smoking originally when there were no
warnings on the cigarette packages, when there were no
10:18:51
10:18:55
10:18:59
10:19:04
10:19:05
10:19:10
10:19:13
10:19:20
10:19:22
10:19:25
10:19:30
10:19:33
10:19:43
10:19:46
10:19:48
10:19:51
10:19:55
10:19:58
10:20:02
10:20:07
10:20:13
10:20:17
10:20:19
10:20:24
10:20:27
58 warnings of danger, and when, for the most part, people had
no clue that cigarette smoking could cause things like lung
cancer or COPD, and at a time when the culture in this
country was a culture of smoking, where most of the adult men
smoked cigarettes, where smoking was literally everywhere.
And that culture, by the way, didn't come about by
accident. Oh, no. That culture came about after the
extraordinary efforts on the part of the tobacco companies to
make that culture in the first half of the 20th century,
through advertising after advertising after advertising.
You saw -- I think Dr. Burns showed you and other
witnesses showed you, too, that scale, how the amount of
smoking, per capita smoking, in this country began at almost
nothing in the early part of the 20th century, and then after
the first World War, when the modern cigarette really came
into vogue and manufactured -- that was Camel, actually, back
then -- it skyrocketed over the years to the point where it
reached its peak in the '60s or '70s or '80s. I've forgotten
the exact date, but there were some different measurements on
that. That culture was created by these defendants
deliberately to make smoking okay, to make it culturally
acceptable. In fact, to make it popular.
I should also say that the plaintiffs, who are
members of this class, for the most part, were smoking during
the early part of the campaign of doubt and deception that we
10:20:31
10:20:34
10:20:38
10:20:43
10:20:48
10:20:54
10:20:56
10:21:01
10:21:04
10:21:10
10:21:11
10:21:15
10:21:19
10:21:22
10:21:25
10:21:28
10:21:32
10:21:34
10:21:39
10:21:41
10:21:43
10:21:49
10:21:53
10:22:02
10:22:07
59 know from the evidence began in the early '50s, when the
first credible scientific reports came out and got widely
circulated in the United States, and most -- this is -- Mrs.
Burkhart is one -- began smoking in the heart of that
campaign, 1959, when she was -- '58 or '59, when she was a
teenager.
Here's what's required for class membership, two
things and two things only: Was Mrs. Burkhart addicted to
cigarettes containing nicotine? And did that addiction lead
to her COPD caused by smoking?
That's it. There's no question of fault here.
Fault may be an issue in the case, but it doesn't have to do
with class membership. We'll get to that in a little bit.
So that's it. That's all there is. Addiction and
addiction as the cause of what led to her smoking, which led
to her disease, COPD.
So here's the first question. And let me say this.
I have tried to get these -- this is a Verdict Form question.
I tried to get the text exactly into what you'll see. There
may be some slight variations, but you are going to have the
Verdict Form in your hand in the jury room. So that's the
text that you're going to be looking for.
So if there's any difference between the text that
I show you here, it's a mistake on my part and you should
ignore it and just use the text that you have and the Verdict
10:22:12
10:22:15
10:22:19
10:22:22
10:22:25
10:22:29
10:22:36
10:22:39
10:22:42
10:22:46
10:22:49
10:22:54
10:22:57
10:23:01
10:23:05
10:23:09
10:23:12
10:23:17
10:23:19
10:23:23
10:23:26
10:23:28
10:23:30
10:23:32
10:23:35
60 Form that you have in the jury room with you.
But here's the first question: Was Pauline
Burkhart addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?
I think in your heart of hearts, applying common
sense, based on what you've heard in this courtroom, there
can't be any doubt that Mrs. Burkhart was addicted. I don't
even think you needed to hear the testimony of expert
witnesses on this point.
She's an intelligent woman. She smoked for
something like 35 years. You heard her talk about the
compulsion that cigarettes had over her, the hold they had
over her; but there was a lot of evidence otherwise, and so
let's take a look at it.
Here are some facts about addiction that you heard
from the testimony on behalf of Mrs. Burkhart in the course
of this case:
Nicotine addiction is a brain disease.
Nicotine changes the structure and the function of
the brain.
Once one is addicted to nicotine, the brain can't
function normally without nicotine. It screams out for
nicotine when nicotine is not in the brain.
So-called enjoyment -- you heard a bit about this
yesterday. When Mr. Burkhart was on the witness stand, he
was asked did Mrs. Burkhart enjoy smoking. "Yeah.
10:23:38
10:23:40
10:23:44
10:23:46
10:23:54
10:23:56
10:24:04
10:24:06
10:24:07
10:24:12
10:24:17
10:24:20
10:24:24
10:24:25
10:24:29
10:24:33
10:24:34
10:24:38
10:24:43
10:24:45
10:24:49
10:24:52
10:24:56
10:25:00
10:25:03
61 "Why?
"Because she was addicted."
So-called enjoyment of smoking is simply the relief
of withdrawal symptoms and the stimulation of the brain's
reward system. You heard that from both Dr. Cummings and
from Dr. Burns.
In terms of the addictive power of nicotine, only
three percent of regular smokers who attempt to quit each
year actually succeed in quitting.
On average, it takes somewhere in the neighborhood
of five to seven serious attempts to quit before a smoker
successfully gets off addiction to nicotine.
An individual's level of nicotine addiction is a
huge factor in whether they can successfully quit. And you
heard about how deeply addicted Mrs. Burkhart was.
Some people who start smoking -- people who start
smoking cigarettes at a younger age have a higher level of
addiction to nicotine. You heard that from the expert
witnesses and you know that applies to Mrs. Burkhart.
Once a person is addicted to nicotine, her ability
to exercise free will is constrained. I'm going to come back
to that because that's going to be an essential issue of this
case, free will and choice versus addiction.
Nicotine addicts use psychological defense
mechanisms, like denial and rationalization, to justify
10:25:06
10:25:07
10:25:08
10:25:12
10:25:16
10:25:19
10:25:20
10:25:26
10:25:30
10:25:36
10:25:38
10:25:42
10:25:45
10:25:50
10:25:53
10:25:58
10:26:02
10:26:05
10:26:09
10:26:10
10:26:14
10:26:19
10:26:22
10:26:24
10:26:28
62 continued smoking. You heard a lot of that from Dr. Burns.
He uses a fancy term, "cognitive dissonance," which has to do
with conflicting information in your mind and how addiction
affects a person's resolution of that conflicting
information.
The fact that a person is able to successfully quit
does not mean that she was not addicted to nicotine in the
first place.
And, finally, addiction causes disease because it
leads to continued use of cigarettes, and it's the continued
use of cigarettes that causes the damage to the body.
You heard from both Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns
about the modern scientific definition of addiction; and this
applies not just to nicotine, but to all other addictive
drugs as well.
"Addiction" is defined as a chronic, relapsing
brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and
use, despite harmful consequences. It is considered a brain
disease because drugs actually change the structure of the
brain and how the brain works. And that's what Mrs. Burkhart
suffered from.
This is the definition, as you heard, that doctors
are taught to use, all across this country that doctors are
taught to use in diagnosing nicotine addiction and in
treating nicotine addiction.
10:26:35
10:26:38
10:26:42
10:26:45
10:26:49
10:26:49

10:27:48
10:27:52
10:27:57
10:28:00
63 Receptors in the brain accept nicotine and respond
to it. The wiring in the brain is altered as a result of the
ingestion of nicotine. Nicotine becomes necessary in order
for the brain to function normally; and without nicotine, the
person doesn't feel normal, feels abnormal, goes into
withdrawal.
The Surgeon General on any number of occasions has
talked about nicotine addiction. This is from the 2010
report. This is a repetition, a repeat, of what was
reflected in the 1988 report when the Surgeon General finally
and for the first time concluded, based on information that
was finally then available about addiction and nicotine in
cigarettes, that nicotine and cigarettes was addictive.
Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are
addicting, according to the Surgeon General.
Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes
addiction.
And the pharmacologic and behavioral processes that
determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that
determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine.
You heard both Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns, who have
a wealth of experience and background in dealing with
addiction and treating addicted smokers and diagnosing
addiction, concluded -- and they explained to you why -- that
in their judgment, there's no question but that Mrs. Burkhart
10:28:02
10:28:08
10:28:13
10:28:17
10:28:22
10:28:27
10:28:27
10:28:36
10:28:40
10:28:45
10:28:49
10:28:53
10:28:57
10:29:00
10:29:02
10:29:04
10:29:06
10:29:07
10:29:12
10:29:15
10:29:19
10:29:27
10:29:30
10:29:35
10:29:38
64 was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine.
Now, I don't know whether the defense, when they
argue here today in front of you, is going to contend that
she was not addicted. They really haven't made that plain to
me, at least.
But I do know this: Did you hear any testimony
from any expert in this trial for the defense on the question
of whether or not Mrs. Burkhart was addicted to nicotine?
No. Of course not. They had the ability to go out
into the world and get any expert that was qualified to speak
on this subject come in here and testify, if they could find
an expert who would testify that Mrs. Burkhart wasn't
addicted, but they didn't.
This is what we see. No defense experts testified
in this trial on whether or not Mrs. Burkhart was addicted to
nicotine, and I think that is important in terms of your
assessment of that issue.
So here's the answer I submit you should give to
that first question on this -- the issue of class membership:
Was Pauline Burkhart addicted to cigarettes containing
nicotine? And the answer is yes.
Now, the second question on class membership I put
before you has to do with whether or not the addiction to
cigarettes containing nicotine was a cause of Mrs. Burkhart's
COPD.
10:29:41
10:29:45
10:29:53
10:29:56
10:30:00
10:30:02
10:30:06
10:30:10
10:30:13
10:30:26
10:30:29
10:30:33
10:30:35
10:30:41
10:30:45
10:30:48
10:30:55
10:30:58
10:31:01
10:31:05
10:31:08
10:31:10
10:31:15
10:31:19
10:31:24
65 And the answer to that question, you are going to
be instructed -- the judge has already given you an
instruction; I'm just repeating it for you -- on what "legal
cause" means in this case for this purpose. And as His Honor
instructed you, to prove that addiction to smoking cigarettes
containing nicotine caused Mrs. Burkhart to develop COPD, she
must prove that the addiction directly and in natural and
continuous sequence produced or substantially contributed --
you see, I've underlined that one -- to producing one or
both -- to producing the disease COPD, and that but for the
addiction, the disease would not have occurred.
There's a second part of this instruction. Here it
is. His Honor gave you and will give you again at the end of
this case. "Addiction may be a cause of a disease even
though it operates in combination with some other cause, as
long as the addiction contributes substantially to producing
the disease."
So in both aspects of the instruction, the notion
of substantial, substantially contributed or contributed
substantially, is important, features prominently in the
definition, and that's because it doesn't have to be --
addiction doesn't have to be the only reason that Mrs.
Burkhart continued to smoke in order for the addiction to be
a legal cause of smoking and disease. As long as the
addiction was part of the reason, and a substantial part of
10:31:27
10:31:31
10:31:33
10:31:36
10:31:42
10:31:45
10:31:49
10:31:54
10:31:59
10:32:02
10:32:06
10:32:10
10:32:13
10:32:16
10:32:19
10:32:23
10:32:27
10:32:28
10:32:33
10:32:37
10:32:43
10:32:46
10:32:50
10:32:53
10:32:59
66 the reason, that's all that the law requires.
So what do we mean by "substantial"? I should say
to you in this instruction and for this purpose, the language
that's being used is not legalese. It's not supposed to be
special to lawyers. This is supposed to be language that is
common to us all, common usage.
So when we use the word "substantial," that doesn't
have any special legal meaning. It has the meaning that you
use it in everyday common application.
So what does it mean? Here are some synonyms.
Actual, real versus unreal, more than trivial.
One way of trying to understand what a word means
is to try and understand what the opposite means. So we have
substantial.
What about insubstantial? What does insubstantial
mean? Trivial, inconsequential, of little or no importance,
negligible.
So another way of putting the instruction to you is
if Mrs. Burkhart's addiction to nicotine was more than a
negligible reason why she continued to smoke, that has a
legal cause.
If it was more than of little or no importance,
it's a legal cause under the instruction.
The issue of legal cause really in this situation
has two parts to it. The first part is here: Was

67 addiction -- because we're talking about smoking. Addiction
in and of itself, obviously, doesn't have any import. It's a
question of what you're addicted to.
So in this case the first part is, was addiction a
cause of smoking, Mrs. Burkhart's smoking, a cause?
The second part: Was smoking, the smoking that
resulted from the addiction, a cause of her COPD?
So with the idea of what "substantial" means and
what "insubstantial" means here is really the question for
the first part of that two-part question. Here it is: Was
addiction a substantial part of the reason that Mrs. Burkhart
persisted in smoking cigarettes --
MR. BELASIC: And I object to this as contrary to
the Verdict Form and the instructions.
THE COURT: Overruled.
MR. HEIMANN: -- or was addiction only a trivial or
inconsequential part of the reason that Mrs. Burkhart
persisted in smoking cigarettes? That's really what this
question boils down to, legal cause question boils down to.
Now, how did the witnesses answer that question?
The witnesses for Mrs. Burkhart, because no witnesses
testified on this question for any of the defendants here.
Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns both testified about
this. They both concluded that it was the addiction that
caused Mrs. Burkhart to continue to smoke cigarettes for the

68 period of time that she did.
The Surgeon General's Report -- this is from the
2010 report -- has the same point. Sustained use and long-
term exposures to tobacco smoke are due to powerfully
addicting effects of tobacco products. Powerfully addicting
effects of tobacco products.
Nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that
individuals persist, persist, in using tobacco products, and
this persistent tobacco use contributes to the diseases
described in that 2010 report, which includes emphysema and
COPD, by the way.
It's not just our experts who are of this view and
of this conclusion as to Mrs. Burkhart, and it's not just the
Surgeon General who is of this view. The defendants
admitted -- here is Dr. Gentry from R.J. Reynolds testifying
just a couple years ago. What did he say about it?
You heard him on the video. He acknowledged
nicotine addiction is a fundamental reason people use tobacco
products. Nicotine is the reason people smoke.
Now, once again, did you hear from any expert in
the field of addiction or medicine from the defendants about
this question of whether or not addiction was a substantial
cause of Mrs. Burkhart's continuing to smoke?
Once again, no. Once again, they certainly had the
ability to go out into the world, this country, and if they

69 could find somebody who was credentialed and credible who
could come in here and testify that nicotine addiction was
not the substantial part of the reason that Mrs. Burkhart
persisted in smoking for 35 years and was not related to her
coming down with COPD, you can be sure that person would have
been there, but they weren't. They don't exist.
Let's come back to the issue, was Pauline Burkhart
addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine a cause of her
COPD? The answer is yes.
But before I leave that, I want to remind you --
I'm not going to repeat what she said, but you saw Mrs.
Burkhart on the witness stand and you heard her testify as to
how hard she tried to break addiction over the years and how
her failure, for the most part, in the '80s affected her, how
it drained her of her self-esteem, how she struggled,
struggled, to overcome the addiction and, because of the
compulsion of that addiction, went back to smoking. That, it
seems to me, is important for you to consider.
The point has been made time and again by the
defense, and questioned the witnesses, that Mrs. Burkhart is
an intelligent woman, very well-educated, wise. Do you think
that the person of that character would continue to smoke day
in and day out, week in and week out, year after year two
packs a day, three packs a day if she could stop, just stop?
Does that make any sense at all? It was -- it was the
10:38:22
10:38:24
10:38:27
10:38:31
10:38:35
10:38:38

10:39:49
10:39:59
10:40:05
10:40:11
10:40:20
70 addiction.
The second part of this two-part question is an
easy one because -- it's not here. The second part is, did
her smoking -- remember, I said there are two parts to this:
Did the addiction cause the smoking, persistent smoking; and
did the smoking -- the second part -- cause the disease?
The defendants have agreed as to the medical
causation part, the second part, that the smoking caused the
disease. So that's not in doubt or in play, I should say.
Now, the defendants, I know, will argue, well, she
really chose to smoke. Even if she was addicted, she chose
to smoke, and it was that choice that was the reason she
continued to smoke and it wasn't related to her addiction.
Once again, you heard from the folks who know what
they're talking about in this regard, Dr. Burns and Dr.
Cummings, that addiction constrains choice. It overcomes
choice, free choice. That's the nature of addiction. That's
why it is addiction. If all one had to do was freely choose,
then they weren't addicted, clearly.
And, again, if there was anybody who knows what
they're talking about in this regard, who would come in here
as an expert and be qualified to speak to this question of
whether or not choice is the reason people smoke versus
addiction, the defense could put them up. Put them up, let
them tell you that, but they didn't. They didn't because
10:40:25
10:40:30
10:40:32
10:40:38
10:40:41

10:42:04
10:42:09
10:42:12
10:42:19
71 there isn't anybody out there who is qualified who will come
into court and say that.
So that is -- those are the two questions, Verdict
Form questions, that determine class membership; and your
answer "Yes" to both of those then establishes that Mrs.
Burkhart is a member of the Engle class, and that then -- but
only then, that entitles her and you must apply the findings
that that Engle jury made after the year-plus of testimony
that they heard and the trial verdict that they reached.
I want to move on to the order that His Honor
instructed you today to talk first about the intentional
tort, the claims of fraud and concealment here, and the first
is fraudulent concealment. And this is the Verdict Form, I
hope, that will be presented to you on this question. Did
Pauline Burkhart rely to her detriment on statements made by
the defendants that concealed or omitted material information
concerning either the health effects or the addictive nature
of smoking cigarettes?
You will be asked to give yes or no for each of the
defendants.
And there's a second, very closely related
question. This has to do with the conspiracy aspect of this.
Did Mrs. Burkhart rely to her detriment on statements made in
furtherance of the defendants' agreement, because there's --
according to the Engle findings, not only did they do it
10:42:25
10:42:28
10:42:29
10:42:40
10:42:45
10:42:48
10:42:52
10:42:57
10:43:01
10:43:03
10:43:11
10:43:16
10:43:20
10:43:23
10:43:28
10:43:31
10:43:35
10:43:38
10:43:39
10:43:42
10:43:44
10:43:47
10:43:50
10:43:53
10:43:56
72 individually, not only did they make misstatements and
conceal information individually on their own, they agreed
with the other tobacco companies to do the same thing. Why?
To make their plan more effective. If one of them only was
out there talking -- giving false statements about the
addictiveness of cigarettes or concealing what they knew
about the addictiveness of cigarettes or the same with
respect to health, it would be very ineffective for the
industry as a whole, but they all got together. They agreed
to do this.
So you will be asked again to determine whether or
not those -- that conduct and the Court has instructed you on
this multiple times during the course of this trial, whether
that conduct affected Mrs. Burkhart's conduct, whether she
relied on that, those statements.
And here are -- what I've done here is tried to
compress the Engle findings, because there are two separate
findings on this that are closely related, and this is what
you will accept: That the defendants, each of these
companies, knowingly concealed or omitted material
information and that they entered into an agreement with each
other to conceal or omit material information that was not
otherwise known or available concerning the health effects
and/or the addictive nature of cigarettes with the intent
that smokers, like Mrs. Burkhart and other members of the
10:43:59
10:44:02
10:44:06
10:44:08
10:44:12
10:44:16
10:44:19
10:44:21
10:44:25
10:44:28
10:44:29
10:44:33
10:44:37

10:44:43

10:44:53
10:44:56
10:44:58

10:45:06
10:45:10
10:45:14
10:45:18
73 public, would rely to their detriment on the concealment or
omission. So that's the finding that is binding upon you
here.
Now, just to give you an example, what are we
talking about in terms of the kinds of statements that the
tobacco companies engaged in over the years from which they
concealed and omitted material information?
There are all sorts. In their advertising, every
time they advertised a cigarette and failed to disclose what
they knew about the health effects of smoking, what they knew
about the addictiveness of smoking, that was a
misrepresentation.
MS. GALLAGHER: Your Honor, object to that post-'69
preemption.
THE COURT: Overruled.
MR. HEIMANN: In their television appearances, of
which there were many, every time the tobacco company is on
television, either, you know, sponsoring a show or having
some spokesman on and they failed, because they did every
time -- they never admitted in any of those appearances that
cigarettes were -- caused health problems, caused COPD, never
admitted it was addictive. They concealed and omitted that
information, and every time they opened their mouths in press
releases, in statements to the news media, in press
conferences, in testimony before Congress, in sporting events
10:45:22
10:45:26
10:45:31
10:45:32
10:45:35

10:46:36
10:46:39
74 which they sponsored, NASCAR, for one, tennis, what was the
Virginia Slims Tournament, another, permeated the American
culture. Movies and product placements and also when they
offered filter cigarettes and when they offered low-tar
cigarettes, and every activity, every activity on the part of
the tobacco companies that reached Mrs. Burkhart and reached
the public, they concealed -- according to the findings by
Engle, they concealed information, material information,
about the health effects of smoking and about the
addictiveness of cigarettes.
Let me come back to this notion of reliance in this
context. The Court will instruct you that reliance may be a
cause of a disease even though it operates in combination
with some other cause, as long as the reliance contributes
substantially to producing the disease.
Now, in this context, what that means is there may
have been other reasons that Mrs. Burkhart continued,
persisted in smoking cigarettes aside from her reliance on
the omissions and concealments on the part of the tobacco
companies; but if those omissions or concealments were part
of the reason in this case that she didn't quit sooner, part
of the reason, then that satisfies the legal requirements for
proof of reliance.
How do you really determine whether or not Mrs.
Burkhart relied on all of this misinformation?
10:46:42
10:46:47
10:46:51
10:46:58

10:48:10
10:48:14
10:48:18
10:48:20
10:48:30
75 Well, you know she was exposed to it, couldn't help
but be exposed to it. It was everywhere in terms of the
tobacco companies' marketing and promotion and statements and
appearances on television, on radio, everywhere. She knows
she was exposed to it and she said she was. She testified
she was.
What does "reliance" mean under those
circumstances? It just means it influenced her behavior,
influenced her behavior.
And how do you know it influenced her behavior?
Well, one, she told you; but, two, she continued smoking.
That is proof of reliance, that it influenced her behavior.
That she didn't quit sooner, that is proof of reliance.
Let me take a closer look with you at the elements
of what the Engle jury concluded was a conspiracy in this
regard and how it affected people like Mrs. Burkhart.
So we start with what I'll call that campaign that
began in 1954, five years before she began smoking, four or
five years before she began smoking, of denial of the health
risks of smoking, denying that it caused disease, denying
that it had been proved to cause disease, creating doubt
about whether or not it would prove to cause disease, of
deceiving people about whether smoking caused disease,
creating a controversy to itself create doubt on the part of
the public and particularly on the part of people smoking
10:48:36
10:48:40
10:48:44
10:48:48
10:48:52
10:48:55
10:48:56
10:48:59
10:49:03
10:49:04
10:49:07
10:49:12
10:49:18
10:49:26
10:49:34

10:49:41
10:49:44
10:49:50
10:49:55
10:49:59
10:50:03
10:50:06
10:50:11
10:50:17
76 cigarettes.
There are two components to this. The first had to
do with health effects. You're talking about health effects
on the one hand and addiction on the other.
You heard from Dr. Burns how the creation of doubt,
the denial of proof has an impact on cigarette smokers,
people like Mrs. Burkhart, that cognitive dissonance, among
other things, again. They desperately want to continue
smoking because of the addiction, and yet they're hearing
from the health authorities that there's serious question, at
least initially in the early '50s, about whether cigarettes
caused disease; and then as time moved on from, the
scientific community's point of view, there wasn't any
further doubt. It was established.
So Mrs. Burkhart was exposed to that information.
No question. I mean, there's a little open question in my
mind exactly at what point in time one can say she really was
exposed to it in full. There's certainly some question in my
mind about -- and maybe in yours about at what point in time
she started to accept the reality of the health effects of
smoking. We've heard different testimony about that, but
there isn't any question that certainly at some point in time
she got -- not only had been exposed to the information, but
began to accept that it was right and that it might be a
problem for her.
10:50:20
10:50:22
10:50:24
10:50:27
10:50:28
10:50:37
10:50:44
10:50:47
10:50:52
10:50:56

10:51:23
10:51:25
10:51:28
10:51:31
10:51:34
10:51:37
10:51:40
10:51:42
77 But at the same time she was getting the
information from the other side that was telling her, "Look,
it may not really be bad. It may be okay. We're working on
it. And, by the way, we're making cigarettes that are better
for you." I'll come more to that in a few minutes.
What do the tobacco companies think about how
successful they were being in what they were doing?
Just a couple of exhibits. Here's Exhibit 71 that
we gave you. And this is an internal document, one of those
documents that didn't become available to us, to you, until
the late 1990s. "We must in the near future" -- I think this
was from 1964, if I'm not mistaken, shortly after the first
Surgeon General's Report came out. "We must in the near
future provide some answers which will give smokers a
psychological crutch and the self-rationale to continue
smoking."
That was the objective of the campaign of doubt and
deception, just as you heard Dr. Burns talk about it. It was
to give people like Mrs. Burkhart a reason to continue
smoking, if only for a little while longer, to avoid having
to go through the pain of breaking through the addiction.
Another one, this is Exhibit 27. "Doubt is our
product since it is the best means of competing with the,"
quote, "'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general
public."
10:51:45
10:51:48

10:52:58
10:53:01
10:53:08
10:53:14
10:53:19
10:53:23
78 Let me stop there. So the body of fact they're
talking about here, of course, is what the scientific and
health authorities have been trying to get out to the public,
that it's been demonstrated that smoking causes a disease and
that it's harmful.
So, instead of trying to beat back with some
science that doesn't exist or refute that, they create a
doubt, a doubt about it.
It is also a means of establishing a controversy.
Again, controversy so that people like Mrs.
Burkhart would be hearing both sides and would be put into a
quandary over which is right; and as addicted persons -- I've
got Dr. Burns there -- they're conflicted, and this has the
effect of causing them to fail to quit sooner, of causing
them to continue to smoke cigarettes even though they're
coming to the realization that there's a serious potential
problem.
On this issue of reliance and what the companies
intended, Robert Heimann, you heard from him. I'd like to
play just a brief piece of Dr. -- of Mr. Heimann's testimony
that you heard yesterday, I think.

(Indiscernible).
FIRST VOICE: "As far as you're concerned, a person

SECOND VOICE: "Yes."
MR. HEIMANN: So that's what the tobacco companies
intended. They intended that people like Mrs. Burkhart rely
upon their false assertions that it hadn't been proved, that
cigarettes didn't cause disease, and that they could continue
to smoke while they, the tobacco companies, were working on
improving cigarettes.
And what did they think -- inside the tobacco
companies, what did they think about whether or not they had
been successful in their efforts to induce people like Mrs.
Burkhart to continue smoking?
Here's what they thought. This is Exhibit 83.
This is from the early 1970s or maybe a little later. Maybe

"For nearly 20 years this industry has employed a
single strategy to defend itself. The strategy was
brilliantly conceived and executed over the years, helping us
win important battles" -- and here we go again -- "creating
doubt about the health charge without actually denying it."
There's one other aspect of this that's -- how do I
blank that?
There's one other aspect about this that's really
important, because it's something that Mrs. Burkhart
testified in considerable detail, and that is one of the
other things that the tobacco companies repeatedly said was,
"We are working to remove anything that might be harmful from
cigarettes, and we will remove anything that we find is
harmful in cigarettes," and that was a theme that permeated
this whole period of this doubt and controversy and so forth.
You've heard Mrs. Burkhart testify specifically
that that was one of the messages she got, that they were
going to remove and were removing the harmful chemicals that
they found in cigarette smoking, and -- in cigarettes. I'm
sorry. And this is from 1971.
Is this a video, my Exhibit 63?
This is the sort of things that were said -- this
is what was said and repeatedly said during the course that

This is from 1971, Face the Nation.
(Video played as follows: "From CBS Washington, in
color, Face the Nation, a spontaneous and unrehearsed news
interview with Joseph Cullman, III, chairman and chief
executive officer of Philip Morris, Incorporated, and
chairman of the executive committee of The Tobacco Institute.
MR. CULLMAN: "We have no program that I know of to
try to help people to stop smoking. We -- we do talk to the
question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous. We do
not believe that cigarettes are hazardous. We don't accept
that, because when, as and if any ingredient in cigarette
smoke is identified as being injurious to human health, we
are confident that we can eliminate that ingredient."
A VOICE: "Do you believe that cigarettes are safe?
Have they been proved to be safe, Mr. Cullman?"
MR. CULLMAN: "I believe they have not been proven
to be unsafe."
MR. HEIMANN: That's good.
"When and as if -- and if anything in cigarettes is
found to be harmful, we can remove it and we will remove it,"
that's what they said time and time again, and that's what
Mrs. Burkhart heard.
And then, of course, there's the whole notion of

10:58:51
10:58:51
82 selling other types of cigarettes. We're talking about two
types basically, filters and low-tar and light cigarettes, as
safer products.
The tobacco companies realize there was a segment
of the population that was concerned about smoking based on
reports that were -- that came out and the information that
the health authorities were putting out, and they devised,
literally devised, a way to fool people about the dangers of
cigarettes that they marketed as filter cigarettes and light
cigarettes.
At the same time, the tobacco companies knew full
well, knew, that filter cigarettes were no safer, that low-
tar cigarettes were no safer, that light cigarettes were no
safer. They knew that internally based on their own
research, but that's not what they said to the public and
that's not what they said to Mrs. Burkhart.
But here's what they said internally. This is
Exhibit 357. This is -- I've forgotten exactly. This is a
guy by the name of Pepples writing, and I can't remember
whether he was R.J.R. or Philip Morris, but you will see it
when you see the document.
"The tobacco industry has reacted to the challenge
of the smoking and health controversy" -- remember this is an
internal document now; we didn't see this until the late
1990s -- "in the following ways: Number one, produce more
10:58:55
10:58:58
10:59:02
10:59:04
10:59:07
10:59:12
10:59:15
10:59:19
10:59:26
10:59:29
10:59:29
10:59:35
10:59:40
10:59:43

11:00:01

11:00:09
11:00:11
11:00:14
11:00:17
83 filter brands and brands with lower tar delivery."
But then he goes on to say, "In most cases,
however, the smoker of a filter cigarette was getting as much
or more nicotine and tar as he would have gotten from a
regular cigarette. He had abandoned the regular cigarette,
however, on the ground of reduced risk to health."
And you heard that from Mrs. Burkhart. That's
exactly what she did. In fact, you heard her testify about
the Kent cigarette and the wonderful filter that was marketed
by the folks who made Kent -- that's Lorillard -- and they
marketed that cigarette deliberately as a safer cigarette
than other cigarettes. That was the plan on the part of the
manufacturers of Kent, Lorillard.
And Mrs. Burkhart was exposed to that market and
she talked about having been attracted to that really good
micronite filter that would remove the bad things, if there
were bad things, in cigarettes that were harmful.
Let me show you what Lorillard, inside the company,
was saying about their marketing of Kent cigarettes.
Exhibit 1500, "As all of us are aware, Kent was
marketed as a," quote, "'safer' cigarette for the smoker who
was concerned about smoking and health."
I don't have it up on this slide, but you will see
in that exhibit they went on to describe how when they put
out this campaign of safer cigarette for Kent with the
11:00:20
11:00:24
11:00:28
11:00:31
11:00:35

11:01:52
11:01:57

11:02:09
11:02:12
11:02:14
11:02:19
84 micronite filter, the sales of Kent went from near nothing to
millions in a very short period of time. They knew what they
were doing when they marketed the cigarette as safer when
they knew it wasn't safer.
They knew that people concerned about the health
effects of cigarettes would buy and use those cigarettes
rather than taking the step that would have really helped,
which is to quit smoking, because that was the whole point of
filter cigarettes and low-tar cigarettes and light cigarettes
and safer cigarettes, was to get people who were addicted to
switch over to those cigarettes rather than to quit
altogether, because they held up the promise, the hope that
they were safer and the person could use those cigarettes
instead of the regular cigarettes and have less chance of
injury.
Mrs. Burkhart, as I said, testified that's exactly
what happened with her, exactly what happened with her. Now,
that's been talking about the health issue.
Now, let's talk a little bit about the addiction
part of it, the concealment by the companies of what they
knew about the addictive nature of cigarettes and, even
worse, their deliberate design and engineering of cigarettes
to make them even more addictive than they otherwise would
be.
You heard a lot of that from Dr. Cummings. I'm not
11:02:22
11:02:27
11:02:34
11:02:39
11:02:40
11:02:44

11:03:17
11:03:22
11:03:24
11:03:29
11:03:35
11:03:39
11:03:41

11:03:50
11:03:56
11:03:58
11:03:58
85 going to repeat the testimony that he gave, but you heard all
about that in his testimony, about the research that the
tobacco companies engaged in and to nicotine, the human
research that they did on smoking behaviors, and how they
then used the knowledge that they obtained in all that
research and all that study to design and redesign and
engineer their cigarettes so that they would be as addictive
as possible.
Here's from 1959, an internal document: Why do
people smoke?
Physiological reasons, not psychological, although
there is a psychological component to it, but they knew then
there were physiological reasons and one of them was
addiction. That's Exhibit 96 from 1959.
Exhibit 76: Tobacco products -- again, this is the
internal document. We didn't see these until the late '90s.
Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a
potent drug with a variety of physiological effects.
Then Exhibit 163. This is from 1963. We are --
we, the industry -- is in the business of selling nicotine,
an addictive drug.
That's what they knew inside the companies, but
they didn't say that outside, just the contrary. They denied
that nicotine was addictive, they denied that cigarettes were
addictive. They denied it, denied it, denied it right up
11:04:01
11:04:03
11:04:06
11:04:09
11:04:12
11:04:16
11:04:23
11:04:27
11:04:27
11:04:32
11:04:35
11:04:38
11:04:42
11:04:44
11:04:47
11:04:54
11:04:58
11:05:01
11:05:08
11:05:11
11:05:15
11:05:16
11:05:20
11:05:25
11:05:28
86 through 1994, when they testified before Congress about it.
You remember that? They never admitted it until they were
forced to admit it in the late 1990s, either 1999 or 2000 or
just after the turn of the century.
And they concealed what they knew not only from the
public. They concealed it from the public health authorities
and in particular in one instance from the Surgeon General.
Do you remember this? This is a telegram that the
author of the memo I just showed you, "We're in the business
of selling nicotine, an addictive drug," this is a telegram
that he sent to his colleagues saying, "Finch agrees" --
Finch was the president of BMW, I think, at the time --
"submission Battelle" -- Battelle was that study by the Swiss
company that he was talking about here when he says, "We're
in the business of selling nicotine." This business of
selling nicotine, an addictive drug, came from the studies
that they had commissioned the Battelle company to do in
Switzerland about the addictive nature of cigarettes and
nicotine.
So here he's saying, despite the fact that the
Surgeon General -- you heard about this -- had asked the
tobacco companies to turn over to the Surgeon General in
1963, when they were working on that first report, to turn
over their research, tell the Surgeon General what they knew
about the health hazards of cigarettes, tell the Surgeon
11:05:32
11:05:35
11:05:38
11:05:43
11:05:46
11:05:50
11:05:54
11:05:57
11:06:00
11:06:03
11:06:07
11:06:15
11:06:18
11:06:22
11:06:24
11:06:26
11:06:29
11:06:32
11:06:35
11:06:36
11:06:39
11:06:41
11:06:43
11:06:46
11:06:49
87 General what they knew about the addictiveness of cigarettes,
they asked for that information, and here's how they
responded: "Undesirable. Submission of our knowledge,
undesirable," and it wasn't provided to the Surgeon General,
and the Surgeon General in 1964 concluded that cigarettes
were not addictive.
There would have been a different conclusion, I
assure -- there certainly would have been a different
conclusion at that time had the companies, the tobacco
companies, turned over what they knew, because their
science -- and I'm not going to go into these documents, but
you saw them -- their science -- and they said this
internally. Their knowledge about addiction and nicotine and
cigarettes was miles beyond that in the scientific community
outside of the tobacco industry, and it stands to reason.
I mean, who was the most interested group in the
world in knowing about cigarettes and addiction? It was the
tobacco companies. And so they spent an enormous amount of
time and money and effort to understand addiction, how it
works, why it works, and how to take advantage of that
knowledge in designing their cigarettes, the cigarettes that
Mrs. Burkhart bought and used.
Here's that design -- demonstrative that Dr.
Cummings showed you and testified about. The various ways in
which they modified the cigarettes, engineered the cigarettes
11:06:51
11:06:54
11:06:56
11:07:03
11:07:08
11:07:12
11:07:15
11:07:18
11:07:21
11:07:25
11:07:29
11:07:32
11:07:34
11:07:36
11:07:46
11:07:49
11:07:51
11:07:54
11:07:58
11:08:02
11:08:05
11:08:08
11:08:11
11:08:21
11:08:24
88 to maximize their addictive nature. They manipulated the
amounts of nicotine in the cigarettes. They manipulated the
percentage or amount of nicotine that would come out of the
cigarette when smoked. They manipulated the pH of the smoke
to make the nicotine that did come out more addictive than it
otherwise would be.
They altered the design of cigarettes to make the
smoke such that it would go deeper into the lungs and
therefore be even more addictive, that is, as it turns out,
even more harmful on a health basis.
This was the subject of intense research on the
part of all of these companies for years and used in the
design of cigarettes to make them as addictive as possible so
that people like Mrs. Burkhart would become addicted and
would stay addicted and would keep buying their products and
keep putting the money into the companies.
Now, we're talking in part about reliance here. At
some point in time, certainly Mrs. Burkhart came to the
realization that she was addicted. Certainly by the 1980s,
she testified how she thought that she could just put the
cigarettes down if she wanted, but she found out that wasn't
so.
So, okay. At some point in her smoking history she
became aware of that, but you can be sure she didn't know
anything about it, anything at all about what the tobacco
11:08:28
11:08:33
11:08:37
11:08:40
11:08:45
11:08:50
11:08:51
11:08:53
11:08:56
11:09:00
11:09:02
11:09:07
11:09:11
11:09:14
11:09:18
11:09:21
11:09:22
11:09:31
11:09:34
11:09:39
11:09:45
11:09:47
11:09:47
11:09:53
11:09:57
89 companies were doing inside behind their walls in terms of
designing the cigarettes for addiction, in terms of making
them as addictive as possible. That, she didn't know. She
couldn't have known that.
The government didn't know about that. The Surgeon
General didn't know about that. How could she have known?
So if you take all of these in combination, the
campaign of doubt and deception, the denial of the health
effects of smoking, the efforts to create doubt, the efforts
to create a controversy, what they did in terms of the
addictive properties of cigarettes, the selling of filter
cigarettes as safer, the selling of light cigarettes as
safer, if you turn all of that around, if you say that none
of that happened, that instead of doing that, instead of
concealing what they knew, instead of failing to disclose
what they knew about all of this, if the tobacco companies
had instead gone the other direction and been straight up
forward, honest and revealed it all, here's the question:
How would that have impacted Mrs. Burkhart?
Don't you think that her behavior, her smoking
behavior, would have been affected had that information, all
that information, been made available to her, particularly if
it had been made available to her in the early part of her
smoking career?
She started smoking in the late '50s. All of this
11:10:00
11:10:05
11:10:08
11:10:11
11:10:12
11:10:16
11:10:19
11:10:33
11:10:37
11:10:40

11:10:59

11:11:11
11:11:16
11:11:20
11:11:23
11:11:26
11:11:31
11:11:35
11:11:36
90 information was in their possession by that time, and their
campaign of doubt and deception began in the early '50s.
How about if they had been straight? There's a
good chance she would have never started smoking in the first
place, because it would have impacted the culture in the
1950s, and it's that culture that in large part is people
like Mrs. Burkhart began smoking, the culture created by the
tobacco companies.
But at the very least, if all that information had
been made known, it would have given her the opportunity to
try to quit earlier in her smoking career, presumably when
she was less addicted, because she wasn't smoking nearly as
many cigarettes then as she got up to later on. That's
reliance. That's influencing behavior.
THE COURT: Counsel, is this an appropriate point
just to take a stretching break?
MR. HEIMANN: Sure, Your Honor.

a moment and we won't take a full recess, but we'll just. . .

were using?

had been admitted.

Madam clerk, what are we talking about? A video?
THE COURTROOM DEPUTY: No. One of his exhibits
that he displayed, it hasn't been admitted. So I turned it
off.

trial to the jury?
THE COURTROOM DEPUTY: No.
THE COURT: We did not display it during the course

MR. HEIMANN: Okay.

notes as something that I had a witness testify about.

THE JUROR: It says, "Analog error input."
THE COURT: It still says, "Analog"?
THE JUROR: Yes.
THE JUROR: Only on a couple of the computers. We
can see in front of us perfectly fine; but on our specific
screen, there's an analog error.
THE COURT: Well, the plug has become unplugged or
whatever.
Let's ask Madam Clerk, can you go over and wiggle
their plugs or see what the fault is?
THE COURTROOM DEPUTY: Judge, can they move down?
THE COURT: Is this turned on now for their
display? Let's turn it on for their display.
THE COURTROOM DEPUTY: It's on now.
THE COURT: And yet some are not receiving it?
Why don't you display that chart, please, sir,
counsel.
Are you seeing that display?
THE JUROR: We see the display, but there's a black
box with an error message in the middle of it. It just says,
"Analog display did not display."
This video mon --
THE COURTROOM DEPUTY: On just the one monitor?
THE JUROR: This one, that one.

to?
THE JUROR: Yes, the one right next door.
THE COURT: Right next door?
THE JUROR: Yes.
THE COURT: You can move down, if you like, so that
you can see it. Does that solve it?
THE JUROR: Uh-huh.
THE COURT: Very good.
Please continue.
MR. HEIMANN: All right. So, in terms of the
instructions that His Honor has given you and will give you,
the question really is, have we established through the
testimony of Mrs. Burkhart and the other witnesses and the
evidence that we've admitted that it is more likely than not,
more right than wrong that if all of this information, all of
the truthful information had been provided to her about all
of the things we've been talking about, including filter
cigarettes and light cigarettes, if all of that information
had been provided to her in the late '50s and the early '60s,
is it more likely than not it would have influenced her
11:16:16
11:16:19
11:16:24
11:16:25
11:16:26
11:16:28
11:16:29
11:16:31

11:17:02
11:17:08
11:17:12
11:17:16
11:17:18
11:17:23
94 behavior to quit smoking sooner?
That's the question, because if you conclude that
it is more likely than not, more right than wrong that that
would have impacted her behavior, then your verdict should be
in favor of Mrs. Burkhart on the question of reliance on the
material omissions and concealments that the Engle jury has
found that the tobacco companies engaged in.
And the same thing is true on the conspiracy,
because the conspiracy just means that R.J. Reynolds, for
example, is responsible for Lorillard's acts and omissions,
and Lorillard is responsible for Philip Morris's. So they're
all responsible for each other's.
So if you conclude this it is more likely right
than wrong that her behavior would have been positively
influenced to stop smoking earlier, if all of that
information had been available to her, if they hadn't lied,
if they hadn't tried to get her to believe there was a
controversy, if they hadn't offered up filter cigarettes and
light cigarettes as safer, they said they're just as bad as
the regular cigarettes or never offered them at all, which is
better yet, would that have -- more likely than not have
influenced her behavior to stop?
Because if you conclude that it did, then you
conclude that she relied -- that's the one element that
you're supposed to be resolving -- and you will also find
11:17:26
11:17:31

95 that it was the legal cause, reliance was the legal cause of
her injury, because had she stopped smoking -- and actually
the defense brought this out with Dr. Burns. Had she stopped
smoking within, say, the first ten years or so, smoking, so
if she stopped smoking by the end of the '60s, she wouldn't
have gotten COPD, in all likelihood.
So I'm saying on the Verdict Form questions, was
the concealment a cause of Mrs. Burkhart's COPD, your answer
should be yes, if you conclude it's more likely right than
wrong.
And did she rely to her detriment? The same thing.
And was reliance a cause of her COPD? The same
thing on the conspiracy claim.
Now, we come -- I want to address this a little
bit. This is kind of an odd duck. We don't tell you why
this issue is important, whether the reliance occurred before
May 5, 1982, or after. And I'm sure His Honor will say you
don't need to know the technicalities of this. This is a
legal technicality.
MR. BELASIC: Objection, Your Honor. It's not a
technicality; it's the law of Florida.
THE COURT: Well, I think what I need to do is ask
you to pause and give brief explanation why this question is
there.
MR. HEIMANN: All right.
11:18:50

11:20:05
11:20:07
11:20:10
11:20:11
96 THE COURT: I'm not going to explain the
technicalities of it, but I do need to give the explanation.
The answer to these questions will not influence or
adjust your verdict or change the judgment of the court in
any respect. These questions are there because there's a
pending issue before the Florida Supreme Court.
The lower appellate courts in Florida have come out
with different answers. So this question has been presented.
It has not yet been argued nor decided by the Florida Supreme
Court, and that's on statute of repose.
Under Florida law, like a statute of limitations,
there's also a statute of repose, and they're phrased
alternatively. If you have not brought your suit within the
period of the statute of limitations, four years, you can't
sue; and that's a question for you to decide. You understand
why you have to decide that question.
The criteria for that is before the four years --
before the lawsuit started, did she already know or have
reason to know that the fraudulent statements were not true?
That's the statute of limitations.
But Florida also has what's called a statute of
repose. That means regardless of when she knew, if the
wrongful acts are more than twelve years ago, whether she
knew or not, whether she had reason to believe or not, even
if the statute of limitations had not expired, we don't want
11:20:12
11:20:14
11:20:17
11:20:26
11:20:28
11:20:30
11:20:36
11:20:39
11:20:42
11:20:46
11:20:49
11:20:53
11:21:00
11:21:05
11:21:09
11:21:12
11:21:15
11:21:22
11:21:27
11:21:37
11:21:39
11:21:42
11:21:48
11:21:55
11:21:58
97 lawsuits in which the wrongful conduct complained of was more
than twelve years ago.
So the normal statute of limitations is four years;
but the statute of repose, regardless of the elements of the
statute of limitations, we don't want lawsuits where the
wrongful conduct, that is, the wrongful conduct and the
reliance thereon occurred more than twelve years ago. That's
why we have this May 5th, 1982, date. You'll recognize that
as exactly twelve years before 1994, when the Engle class
action was filed.
The only reason we've included the question --
because it doesn't affect our judgment or your verdict
here -- is it helped us save your verdict or understand your
verdict, depending on how the Florida Supreme Court rules.
The Florida Supreme Court can rule several
different ways as to how and when the statute of repose
starts, and therefore we need your additional statement --
again, these statements and answers will not affect your
verdict nor your judgment in any respect. They are special
interrogatories. They are side issues, and therefore you
should not concern yourselves with the technicalities of the
statute of repose, and I have not instructed you on the legal
technicalities of the statute of repose.
But this simply tells us of when the reliance was
made so that, depending on how the Florida Supreme Court
11:22:05
11:22:07
11:22:11
11:22:14
11:22:17
11:22:21
11:22:25
11:22:32
11:22:37
11:22:43

11:23:28
11:23:31
11:23:36
98 comes out about the elements that caused the statute to start
to run will affect your judgment.
So, again, in summary, this will not affect your
verdict, but we just need your unanimous statement, unanimous
statement, as to when the statements on which Mrs. Burkhart
relied were made; and the second part of this is relative to
May 5th, 1982, when was her reliance.
MR. BELASIC: Just note our objection to the
instruction and legal description. Thank you, Your Honor.
THE COURT: Sure.
MR. HEIMANN: May I proceed, Your Honor?
THE COURT: Please.
MR. HEIMANN: All right.
So you'll be asked then -- and, actually, the form
I'm showing you here is in slight error.
You are only going to be given on your Verdict Form
the 7(a) and 7(b). You won't get 7(c). So you are just
going to be asked were the statements on which Mrs. Burkhart
relied made by the tobacco companies before that date and
were they made after that date? And you can check one or
both, depending upon what your findings are.
So if you conclude, as I just was suggesting, that
it is more likely than not that sometime prior to this date
she was relying upon statements in the sense I've been
describing, then you would check the first box, and
11:23:40

11:24:31
11:24:33
11:24:37
11:24:41
11:24:46
11:24:50
11:24:53
11:24:57
11:25:01
11:25:04
99 everything virtually -- not virtually -- everything I've been
talking about in terms of the concealments and omissions and
misinformation that came out from the tobacco companies that
was -- that Mrs. Burkhart was exposed to, all of that
certainly came out before 1982. It continued thereafter as
well. But the question is, did she rely upon it before? And
I made my argument on that.
On the after, we have a little bit of a
complication, I think, based on the record, because I think
you could find, based on Mrs. Burkhart's testimony and Mr.
Burkhart's testimony, that by May of 1982 Mrs. Burkhart was
no longer in doubt about the hazards of cigarette smoking.
It's not clear to me, frankly, based on the
testimony, whether that's the case. I mean, there's a point
in 1984 when she makes that really, really hard effort to
quit, and one could say that it was at that point in time
that she had concluded that she didn't believe the tobacco
companies' statements about their being doubt and controversy
and it's only -- it hadn't been proven and so forth and so
on.
So that's possible you can come to that conclusion
based on the testimony, but that doesn't mean that she wasn't
still relying on other aspects of the tobacco companies'
concealment and omission, and in particular the three that
I'm going to mention now.
11:25:08
11:25:11
11:25:14
11:25:17

11:26:18
11:26:20
11:26:24
11:26:27
100 One, the continued statements that they were going
to make cigarettes safer and that they were working to make
cigarettes safer, she testified she heard that and that was
something she believed right up to the end and she was
relying upon.
The second point is the filter cigarettes, because
she continued. She testified to this. She continued to
smoke filter cigarettes after this date of May 1982,
believing that they were safer because of what the tobacco
companies had said about them.
And then third has to do with low-tar and light
cigarettes. You remember she testified that she switched to
Virginia Slims Lights in the mid- to late 1980s, I think is
the date -- you will recall better than I -- and that she did
that for health reasons because she understood, based on what
the tobacco companies were saying and implying, that those
cigarettes were safer.
So, in response to this question, I would submit to
you that the evidence shows, both more likely than not, that
she relied both before and after this date of May 1982.
Now, I'm going to move on to this question of --
that I said at the outset is at the heart of this case, which
is whether or not the defendants in this case bear some
responsibility for what they did and, if so, what
responsibility do they bear and what responsibility does
11:26:29

101 Pauline Burkhart. . .
THE COURT: I think -- again, I apologize for the
interruption. Subject to your corrections or objections, I
believe I already explained to the jury that comparative
fault only applies to the unintentional torts, that is,
negligence and strict liability --
MR. HEIMANN: Yes, sir.
THE COURT: -- and it's not a defense to fraud or
concealment, but it is a defense to negligence; and therefore
we ask you this question, and it does only apply to
negligence and strict liability negligence, that is, if she's
at fault, then what percentage is she at fault? That's
comparative negligence. And, again, it only applies to the
latter two causes of action.
MR. HEIMANN: So the point here -- let me take it
back to basics. If you find that Mrs. Burkhart is a member
of the class, if you answer those first two questions yes,
that she's a member of the class, that means that you will
have found that the defendants here are liable to her on the
negligence and strict liability claims. If she's a member of
the class, that establishes the liability of the defendants.
Her negligence is strict liability, all right?
Then the question is -- the defendants bear the
burden of proof on this, as the Court has told you many
times.
11:28:16
11:28:19
11:28:22
11:28:25
11:28:27
11:28:32
11:28:34
11:28:34
11:28:38
11:28:44
11:28:49
11:28:53
11:28:57

11:29:06
11:29:10
11:29:14
11:29:17
11:29:22
11:29:27
11:29:30
11:29:32
11:29:36
11:29:39
102 Then the question is what, if any -- at that point,
they're 100 percent responsible for the injury once you make
that finding of class membership.
Then the question before you is, what percentage,
if any, of the responsibility for her injuries she bears.
And in this respect, I think it's important to give
consideration to this fact: Everything that Mrs. Burkhart
did in her life with respect to smoking was what the
defendants here wanted her to do, urged her to do, did
everything in their power to get her to do.
She started smoking cigarettes as a teenager, just
as they intended. She became addicted to their cigarettes,
just as they intended. She smoked the cigarettes that they
designed and engineered to maximize her addiction and she
became deeply addicted, just as they intended.
She smoked filter cigarettes, thinking they were
safer, just as they told her and just as they intended. And
she smoked light cigarettes and low-tar cigarettes, thinking
they were safer, just as they intended, just as they told
her, to keep her smoking, to keep her buying cigarettes, to
keep them getting her money and the money of millions of
other Americans just like her.
So that, it seems to me, is important for you to
give thought to when you're considering what percentage of
responsibility, if any, Mrs. Burkhart bears.
11:29:39
11:29:42
11:29:47
11:29:49
11:29:53
11:30:02
11:30:10
11:30:15

11:31:07
11:31:11
11:31:15
11:31:19
11:31:21
11:31:26
11:31:29
103 But now let me talk a little more about this idea
of responsibility on the part of, in this case, Mrs. Burkhart
for negligence, because that's what we're talking about. Was
she negligent in her activities with respect to smoking?
We're all taught from the time we're children that
we have a responsibility for ourselves to protect ourselves.
That's a given.
So let me give you an illustration. We're taught
as children not to attempt to cross a busy street without
looking both ways first, okay?
So if a pedestrian -- if I step into a busy
intersection street and I don't bother to look both ways and
I get struck by a car where the driver couldn't see me in
time to stop and I get injured, it's my fault, okay? Pretty
clear.
But now let me change the illustration a little
bit. Let's say I do fail to look both ways. I step out in
the street and the driver who is coming along isn't paying
attention to his driving. He's texting. It drives me nuts
to see people texting while going down the street. But he's
texting, so he's not paying attention.
Had the driver been paying attention instead of
texting, looking down, he would have been able to stop well
in time to avoid the accident, but he's not. He's not paying
attention and so the accident takes place.
11:31:31
11:31:36
11:31:42
11:31:44
11:31:49
11:31:54
11:31:59
11:32:00
11:32:03
11:32:07
11:32:09
11:32:16
11:32:18
11:32:22
11:32:29
11:32:29
11:32:32
11:32:38
11:32:40
11:32:46
11:32:48
11:32:49
11:32:53
11:32:55
11:32:58
104 So now what do we have? We've got the pedestrian,
who's partially at fault because he didn't look both ways.
Had he looked both ways, he wouldn't have stepped in the
street and got hit. But the driver is at fault, too, because
he wasn't paying attention. He had a responsibility, an
obligation in driving a car safely to be paying attention.
Now, I'll just change it a little bit. Now, this
may seem strange, but you will understand me, where I'm
getting to. Let's say the driver in this case knows the
pedestrian and, for whatever reason, really has it out for
that person, and he sees the pedestrian step off a curb into
the street and he takes advantage of that and deliberately
runs into the pedestrian with the car.
Now, you've got a negligent pedestrian, but an
intentional wrongdoing on the part of the driver; and under
those circumstances, it seems pretty obvious that if you're
trying to decide -- allocate responsibility, fault between
the two, who gets the lion's share of the fault? Surely, the
person who acted deliberately, the person who acted
intentionally, not the person who was simply negligent.
Now, look at that in this case, what that means
here. We've got -- let me see if I've got -- we have a
finding that the defendants placed cigarettes on the market
that were defective and unreasonably dangerous. That doesn't
really necessarily mean they did it intentionally, okay?
11:33:00
11:33:04
11:33:07
11:33:10
11:33:12

11:34:19
11:34:31
11:34:36
11:34:39
105 They may have been negligent in putting on such products.
So if you are you're talking about -- if that was
all we had here, if we had Mrs. Burkhart's smoking cigarettes
on the one hand and the defendants selling products that were
unreasonably dangerous -- were defective and unreasonably
dangerous and that's why she got COPD, because that was the
nature of cigarettes, you might have a situation where
there's more or less equal responsibility between the two;
but that's not all that we have here.
We know that the defendants knew their products
were dangerous, that they would cause disease, that millions
of people would get sick and hundreds of thousands would die
every year. They weren't merely negligent like that driver
who wasn't paying attention. They were like that driver who
deliberately ran over the pedestrian.
But it actually is much worse than that, because we
know from the evidence that these companies deliberately
marketed to teenagers, to youngsters, to get them to start
smoking; that they lied both to them and to adults; that they
concealed critical information both about the health effect
of smoking and about the addictive properties of smoking;
that they rigged their cigarettes to make them more
addictive.
What was the purpose for all of that? What was
their purpose?
11:34:44
11:34:47

106 This was their purpose: Money. "All we would want
then is a larger bag to carry the money to the bank," at the
expense of, as it says here, 400,000 deaths a year.
Actually, it's a good bit more than that today.

cases.
MS. GALLAGHER: And Williams and State Farm, the
THE COURT: I'm going to overrule it.
I'll just simply remind the jury this is just --
this is argument of counsel.
MR. HEIMANN: Back to that illustration of the
driver and the pedestrian, this kind of conduct on the part
of the tobacco companies, inducing kids to start smoking and
then getting them addicted and keeping them smoking, knowing
what the outcome is going to be, that's like the driver.
You've seen this happen. The driver's in the car and he sees
the pedestrian is intending to cross the street. And so the
driver, purporting to be kind, says, "Sure. Go ahead," and
then runs him over. That's what you have here.
It's hard to understand how you could allocate much
responsibility to poor Mrs. Burkhart in that situation as
compared to the fault on the part of the tobacco companies.
11:36:07
11:36:14
11:36:21
11:36:26
11:36:28
11:36:31
11:36:32
11:36:36
11:36:37
11:36:40
11:36:43

11:37:29
11:37:40
11:37:42
11:37:46
107 And I know that the judge has told you this time
and time again, but I'll put it up in red letters. It is the
defendants' burden to prove the degree to which Mrs. Burkhart
is at fault by a preponderance of the evidence.
So, as I say, if you find that she's a member of
the class, at that point in your deliberations, it's 100
percent on these folks, on the defendants. They have to
prove to you what percentage of fault that they would
otherwise bear. You will assign to Mrs. Burkhart.
And moving forward, so this is -- I think this is
an accurate reflection of the sort of Verdict Form question
you will be asked here, and you will decide what percentage,
based on the evidence and based on how persuasive the tobacco
companies are in proving that you will assign to each of the
tobacco companies.
Obviously, to be honest, we don't care how much you
apply to any particular company. Let them tell you about how
they think that should work out. I'm concerned with how much
percentage responsibility you assign to Mrs. Burkhart; but
whatever it is, that's what you should assign in your best
judgment as appropriate.
Now, let me talk in the last two minutes here -- I
don't want to try your patience too much -- turn to the
question of damages.
One of the -- assuming that you find that Mrs.
11:37:50

11:39:22
11:39:30
11:39:32
11:39:34
108 Burkhart is a member of the class, which then means that the
defendants here are liable for negligence and strict
liability, and whether or not you find in her favor on either
of the intentional torts, that doesn't matter for this
purpose, although I'll come to a purpose for which it does
matter, then you will have found them liable and the question
will be what damages, if any, to award. Now, this is totally
separate and apart from the comparative fault.
For purposes of awarding damages, you should ignore
what you decide in comparative fault. The Court will take
care of the effects of your allocation of fault later. Your
damages determination should be strictly based on the
criteria for damages and without regard to this issue of
comparative fault.
And here's one of the instructions that the Court
will give you on this issue, which is you'll be asked, what
is the total amount of damages suffered by Mrs. Burkhart for
the bodily injury and resulting pain and suffering,
disability or physical impairment, mental anguish,
inconvenience, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life in
the past and in the future as a result of COPD?
MR. BELASIC: I have to object, Your Honor. It
totally misstates the actual Verdict Form that we all have
right now.
THE COURT: What does the Verdict Form state?
11:39:37
11:39:41
11:39:46
11:39:50
11:39:54
11:39:56

11:40:47
11:40:48
11:40:50
11:40:51
109 MR. BELASIC: The actual Verdict Form simply says,
"What amount of compensatory damages do you find for
plaintiff," without all of the other language in there.
THE COURT: All right.
MR. HEIMANN: All right. I assume it's in the
instructions.
THE COURT: Say it again. Read it one more time.
MR. BELASIC: Question six on the Verdict Form,
"What amount of compensatory damages do you find for the
plaintiff?"
MR. HEIMANN: Okay.
THE COURT: Very good.
But I do remind you that that's the total amount of
damages. Any allocation of fault, I'll take care of. You'll
tell me what -- allocate fault, but this is intended to be
the full amount, without any discount or any allocation of
the damage. It's the full amount of damage to her that he
wishes to argue for.
MR. HEIMANN: I apologize for having it wrong, Your
Honor.
THE COURT: That's okay.
MR. HEIMANN: I'm confident that the language that
was in that slide I showed you will be in the instructions,
because that's the definition of the elements, if you will,
of damage that you will be taking into account in making a
11:40:52
11:40:54
11:40:58
11:41:00
11:41:01
11:41:03
11:41:03
11:41:05
11:41:08
11:41:10
11:41:13
11:41:13
11:41:14
11:41:17
11:41:22
11:41:26
11:41:30
11:41:35
11:41:39
11:41:41
11:41:42
11:41:44
11:41:48
11:41:52
11:41:56
110 determination as to the amount of damages.
But let me make sure -- I know we said this a
little bit in opening. In determining the amount of damages
to allow in this case, the only thing that you all should be
taking into account are the actual harms and losses that Mrs.
Burkhart suffered as a consequence of the defendants'
conduct, the harms and losses to her.
So I know we've said this several times, but I want
to say it again. Sympathy is not a matter that you should
take into account in deciding how much to allow in damages.
You shouldn't be taking into account the money is not going
to bring back her lungs to being healthy. That's not a
matter that's relevant to the question of the harms and
losses she suffered.
You shouldn't be taking into account whether or not
the amount of money is too much for one person. That's
not -- that's outside the box of what you should be
considering.
There are lots of other reasons that you might
think about in terms of awarding damages, you know, like,
well, if we award too much, it'll hurt business or a money
award is not going to take away her pain. A money award is
not going to save her life. None of those things are to be
taken into account in determining how much money to allow in
damages here, just the harms and losses that she's suffering.
11:41:59
11:42:01
11:42:04
11:42:09
11:42:13
11:42:17
11:42:20
11:42:22
11:42:25
11:42:29
11:42:35
11:42:38
11:42:41
11:42:43
11:42:44
11:42:47
11:42:50
11:42:53
11:42:53
11:42:55
11:42:58
11:43:02
11:43:06
11:43:10
11:43:14
111 And the Court will tell you -- and I'll put up, I
think, another aspect of what you will be told about -- the
amount of damages to allow, is that you should allow an
amount that is full and just and reasonable compensation for
all of the damages that Mrs. Burkhart has suffered.
We're not asking you in this case to award damages
for -- what we call "economic damages," what her medical
expenses were or what her loss of income was as a result of
her COPD. What we are asking you for are pain and suffering,
damages for an allowance of money for pain and suffering.
How do you value pain and suffering in a case like
this to achieve the result of full, just and reasonable
compensation?
So let me see if I can't help in that respect. One
of the things you should certainly be considering is how much
pain Mrs. Burkhart -- did she suffer from, how long did it
last or will it last, and how serious was the pain and
suffering that she has incurred and will incur.
You know, let's talk about how much pain is
involved. If you're talking -- I want to try to do some
comparisons to help you. If you're talking about a case that
involves, say, a broken ankle, an accident that results in a
broken ankle, we're talking about a relatively modest amount
of pain for a relatively short period of time.
A case of that sort, probably you wouldn't
11:43:16
11:43:23
11:43:26
11:43:30
11:43:35
11:43:38
11:43:44
11:43:47
11:43:50
11:43:55
11:44:00
11:44:04
11:44:11
11:44:12
11:44:17
11:44:20
11:44:25
11:44:31
11:44:34
11:44:39
11:44:43
11:44:45
11:44:50
11:44:53
11:44:55
112 amount -- you wouldn't think an allowance of damages for more
than a few thousand dollars, maybe a few tens of thousands of
dollars would be appropriate.
If you're talking about something more serious --
I'm focusing on legs here -- a crushed leg, something way
beyond merely a broken ankle, that would require some
hospitalization, probably several months' worth, now you're
talking about something more serious in terms of the amount
of pain involved and the amount of time involved. Maybe
you're talking now you're into the hundreds of thousands of
dollars for pain and suffering.
But now let's go beyond that, let's say a broken
back that incapacitates a person for a prolonged period of
time with significant pain and incapacity at the same time.
Now, you're talking about a case that's worth in the
millions, in all probability. That's one way you sort of
measure how to evaluate an allowance of pain and suffering.
Let's talk about in terms of the period of time
involved for the person who's suffering. If you're talking
about something in the -- a few days or a few weeks, we're at
the lower end of the scale, thousands or tens of thousands of
dollars.
A year, a couple years, maybe we're in the middle
scale, maybe up to a million dollars, something in that
range.
11:45:01
11:45:06
11:45:08
11:45:09
11:45:13
11:45:17
11:45:22
11:45:27
11:45:29
11:45:32
11:45:35
11:45:37
11:45:41
11:45:45
11:45:51
11:45:54
11:45:57
11:46:03
11:46:07
11:46:11
11:46:16
11:46:18
11:46:19
11:46:22
11:46:26
113 But now let's talk about a prolonged period of
time, 20 years, Mrs. Burkhart's case, and more, her life.
I'm not going to try, because I wouldn't be able to
do it, to get into the details of what you heard from Mrs.
Burkhart about her life. And you heard from Dr. Burns about
what COP (sic) is like to live with.
The pain and the suffering is not just physical;
it's mental. It's not momentary; it's prolonged. It's
life-ending. It's progressive. It never gets better. I
don't know what that's worth. You have to decide.
Can I just have a moment?
THE COURT: Yes, please.
MR. HEIMANN: If I suggested a number to you, which
I will -- I think we kind of promised that we would in
opening statement -- I would say you're talking ten, fifteen
million dollars, maybe more. That's up to you. That really
is up to you all, to take into account all of what you know
and have heard about the impact on Mrs. Burkhart of the
injuries that she suffers and the disease from which she's
suffering, and you decide what is appropriate for bodily
injury, resulting pain and suffering, disability, physical
impairment, mental anguish, inconvenience, loss of capacity.
These are the elements that you should be taking into account
in making that determination.
And I'll skip that since that one is wrong.
11:46:26
11:46:30
11:46:39
11:46:41
11:46:50
11:46:52
11:46:59
11:47:02
11:47:08
11:47:19
11:47:24
11:47:26
11:47:33
11:47:35
11:47:38
11:47:41
11:47:46
11:47:52
11:47:56
11:47:59
11:48:07
11:48:09
11:48:14
11:48:18
11:48:20
114 Okay. So let me get to the very final point before
we break for lunch, which is the next -- the final question,
actually, on the Verdict Form that you will be given, which
is whether or not you find by clear and convincing evidence
that punitive damages are warranted against one or more of
the defendants in this case; and you will be asked to say yes
or no for each of them in turn.
The Judge will instruct you as to the matters that
you take into account in deciding whether or not punitive
damages are warranted, and this is a basic -- one of the
basic aspects of the instruction that he has given you and
will give you again at the end, which is the punitive damages
are warranted if you find that, from the evidence, the
defendant had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of their
conduct and that there was a high probability of injury or
damage to Mrs. Burkhart, and despite that knowledge, they
intentionally pursued that course of conduct, resulting in
the injuries to Mrs. Burkhart.
I would submit to you that the conduct that you've
heard about in this case fits, is in excess of the kind of
conduct they're talking about here.
We've heard about -- Dr. Gentry talked about the
fact that R.J. Reynolds -- and I'm sure the other tobacco
companies now -- recognize that they sell, they manufacture
and sell a risky product.
11:48:27
11:48:32
11:48:36
11:48:39
11:48:42
11:48:47
11:48:49
11:48:51
11:48:58
11:49:02
11:49:06
11:49:09
11:49:12
11:49:17
11:49:21
11:49:25
11:49:28
11:49:32
11:49:34
11:49:42
11:49:49
11:49:53
11:49:56
11:50:00
11:50:04
115 What does that mean? What it really means is that
from the standpoint of the person who's smoking cigarettes,
that they are at risk for developing a disease as a
consequence of their smoking cigarettes.
Not everybody who smokes cigarettes is going to get
sick from cigarettes. We don't know why. There's some
percentage. And they get the various diseases and
consequences from smoking cigarettes and not everybody gets
all of those, by any means.
I think Dr. Gentry said that he understood
somewhere between a third and half of regular cigarette
smokers die from cigarette smoking. I think that's probably
right.
It's curious that he doesn't know better, exactly
what it is. There are statistics on this. It's kind of -- I
don't know what to say about the fact that a man who's in
that business doesn't know the answer to that question
without any hesitation. Anyway, that's beside the point.
But that's the point.
From the standpoint of the individuals, they
recognize that there's some risk that they're going to be
harmed as a result of smoking cigarettes.
Okay. But if you look at it from the standpoint of
the companies that make and sell the cigarettes, in terms of
what the consequences are going to be of their actions, it's
11:50:06
11:50:09
11:50:13
11:50:18
11:50:20
11:50:23
11:50:29
11:50:33
11:50:35
11:50:36
11:50:39
11:50:42
11:50:45
11:50:46
11:50:48
11:50:53
11:50:55
11:50:56
11:51:00
11:51:01
11:51:03
11:51:07
11:51:09
11:51:14
11:51:17
116 not a risk that people are going to be harmed. It's a
certainty. They knew from the beginning that their
cigarettes were going to cause disease, massive disease,
among Americans and were going to kill thousands, tens of
thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. They knew that
to a certainty.
So it wasn't from their perspective a risk; it was
a known fact. And that's where we say, did they have actual
knowledge of the wrongfulness of their conduct? Of course
they did. They knew when they were lying to the American
public that that was wrong, and they knew that it was going
to cause, for sure, massive damages.
It wasn't a high probability, as is in this
instruction. It was a sure thing, and they intentionally
pursued that course. We know that from the evidence. And
they persist to this day.
Here's what it's cost us.
I'm sorry. Let me do this. This has to do with --
and His Honor instructed you a little bit on this. One of
the things is whether or not the tobacco companies recognize
that somebody like Mrs. Burkhart was going to be affected.
The other question is whether or not they recognize
that other people are going to be affected. So this is
another part of the instruction you will get on punitive
damages.
11:51:22

11:52:50
117 In deciding whether to award punitive damages, you
may also consider evidence of harms suffered by persons who
are not parties to this case for the limited purpose of any
light it may shed on the degree of blameworthiness.
Another word for "blameworthiness," I would suggest
to you, is reprehensibility. How reprehensible were the
defendants in the conduct they engaged in?
You may consider such evidence to the extent that
the conduct that harmed the other persons was substantially
similar to the specific conduct that may have harmed the
plaintiff.
Well, we know, don't we, what their conduct -- what
the consequences of their conduct were to millions of people.
Here it is.
One hundred and thirty thousand people die each
year in this country prematurely from COPD caused by
cigarette smoking. Four hundred and eighty thousand people
die each year prematurely from all of the diseases caused by
cigarette smoking.
Since 1964 -- that was the year of the first
Surgeon General's Report -- and this is wrong when it says
2004. That's typo. From 1964 up until today, 2014, the
estimate from the Surgeon General and other health
authorities is that 20 million Americans died prematurely
caused by cigarette smoking. That is the level of
11:52:50
11:52:53
11:52:56
11:53:00
11:53:05
11:53:07
11:53:10
11:53:12
11:53:16
11:53:19
11:53:22
11:53:22
11:53:31
11:53:36
11:53:38
11:53:44
11:53:48
11:53:55
11:53:59
11:54:00
11:54:06
11:54:11
11:54:17
11:54:19
11:54:25
118 reprehensibility and blameworthiness that you all should take
into account in deciding whether or not to award punitive
damages.
I'm not getting to the amount yet. We're just
saying yes, no. That's the question.
Punitive damages are meant to punish for past
conduct, which you've heard about, and to deter, to cause
them to think twice before they do it again.
It's not really just for these companies, because
you're the conscience of the community when you've taken on
the question of whether to award punitive damages.
Here, we're dealing with manufacturers who had the
power to do good or the power to do harm. They chose. They
chose. They chose to lie. They chose to conceal, and they
knew the consequences that would fall from that. You ought
to award punitive damages for that.
Thank you.


CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE PLAINTIFF. 
MR. HEIMANN:  Good afternoon.
15:47:28
You know, it's okay to defend yourself vigorously
15:47:31
when you're accused of having done something and you didn't
15:47:34
do it.  When you're accused of having done something wrong
15:47:36
and you didn't do it.
15:47:40
But if you have done something wrong, and
15:47:43
particularly if you've done something wrong and injured
15:47:46
somebody else, it's not okay.  We get -- we were taught as
15:47:52
children that when you do something wrong, the right thing
15:47:55
to do is to stand up and admit it.
15:48:02
MR. BELASIC:  Objection.  There is no duty to
15:48:04
admit in this case.
15:48:05
THE COURT:  Overruled.
   107
15:48:06
 1
MR. HEIMANN:  You now know, from the last two-plus
15:48:09
 2
hours, if you didn't before, that as I said from the very
15:48:12
 3
beginning of this case, these companies refuse to accept
15:48:17
 4
any responsibility at all for what they did.
15:48:22
 5
Notwithstanding the fact they've been found to
15:48:24
 6
have committed fraud, they've been found to have
15:48:27
 7
deliberately put on the market an unreasonably dangerous
15:48:32
 8
and defective product, they still refused to accept any
15:48:36
 9
responsibility whatsoever for their --
15:48:38
MS. GALLAGHER:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
15:48:39
improper.
15:48:40
THE COURT:  Overruled.
15:48:40
MR. HEIMANN:  -- conduct.
15:48:42
All right.  Enough drama.  Let's settle down.  
15:48:48
Statute of limitations defense.  I want to dispose
15:48:51
of it to begin with.
15:48:52
Let me have -- oh, I can do this.
15:48:54
All right.  So His Honor will give you an
15:48:54
instruction --
15:49:13
THE COURT:  What do you have?  Do you have a mic?  
15:49:13
MR. HEIMANN:  I have a mic, and it's blasting --
15:49:13
THE COURT:  Does the mic feed into our amp system?
15:49:23
MR. ISASI:  Your Honor, the traveling mic --
15:49:26
THE COURT:  You may wander.  Use either that mic
15:49:29
or the walking mic that we have here available.
   108
15:49:41
 1
MR. HEIMANN:  All right.  I'll stand in place.
15:49:43
 2
So here are the questions that really will resolve
15:49:46
 3
this issue of whether or not there's a legitimate statute
15:49:48
 4
of limitations defense here.  And there are just two.
15:49:52
 5
The first is, did Mrs. Burkhart have COPD before
15:49:55
 6
May 5, 1990?
15:49:57
 7
And I think the evidence is very clear that in all
15:50:02
 8
probability she did.  That was the testimony from Dr. Burns
15:50:05
 9
and also the testimony from -- Dr. Cosmo?  Thank you.
15:50:16
Cosmo.
15:50:17
We don't know, however, how severe it was prior to
15:50:21
that time.  But given the nature of this disease and that
15:50:26
it has to progress over time, although there's by no means
15:50:29
any set -- as you heard from Dr. Burns, there's no means of
15:50:33
any set period of time that it progresses in an individual,
15:50:35
we know there are averages, and the statistics show that.
15:50:39
But I think it's fair to conclude that in all
15:50:42
probability she had some level of COPD prior to that key
15:50:45
date, May 1990.  But that's only the first question.
15:50:48
The second question is, did Mrs. Burkhart know, or
15:50:53
by the use of reasonable care should she have known, before
15:50:57
May of 1990, that she had COPD?  And on that question, I
15:51:02
think the answer is equally clear.  And the answer is no.
15:51:06
She certainly testified without equivocation that
15:51:09
she didn't know.  She didn't even know what COPD was until
   109
15:51:12
 1
she was diagnosed with it in 1993, I believe, or 1994.  I
15:51:17
 2
can't recall the exact date.
15:51:20
 3
And I don't believe, in all candor, there's been
15:51:24
 4
any evidence that you can creditably rely upon otherwise.
15:51:29
 5
So the question then is, should she have known by
15:51:31
 6
the use of reasonable care, prior to that date, that she
15:51:35
 7
had COPD.  It's not enough to know that you have a cough.
15:51:39
 8
It's not enough to know that you're short of breath.  The
15:51:41
 9
question is, should she have known that she had COPD, a
15:51:48
debilitating, life-ending disease of the lungs?
15:51:53
And what do we have on that evidence?  Well, the
15:51:56
medical records -- and I'm not going to go through them in
15:52:00
detail, but you'll have them in the jury room to review --
15:52:03
show that in every indication from those records -- and you
15:52:07
heard Dr. Burns explain why that's the case -- indicated
15:52:10
that there wasn't any reason for her to believe, prior to
15:52:12
the time that she saw Dr. Calhoon in 1993, that she had
15:52:18
that kind of a disease.
15:52:19
And in addition to that, you have the fact -- no one
15:52:27
contradicts this -- that Mr. Burkhart, during the 1970s and
15:52:31
the 1980s, as you would expect of an intelligent woman,
15:52:35
went to see the doctor on a regular basis for checkups.
15:52:40
Now, we all know what that entails in the usual
15:52:44
course.  You go, sit down in the waiting room, and you fill
15:52:48
out those forms where they ask you, do you have this?  Do
   110
15:52:51
 1
you have that?  And one of the questions they always ask
15:52:53
 2
you, of course, is do you smoke, how much you've smoked,
15:52:58
 3
how long you've been smoking.
15:52:59
 4
Another question is, what symptoms are you showing of
15:53:02
 5
various and sundry sorts?  And one of them is normally, at
15:53:06
 6
least in my experience, and common sense, is shortness of
15:53:09
 7
breath, cough.  Those are the sorts of things that are on
15:53:15
 8
these forms that you fill out when you go to the doctor on
15:53:18
 9
an annual basis every year.
15:53:21
Now, don't you think that if she was having symptoms
15:53:24
severe enough to cause her to be concerned about the
15:53:30
situation, one, she would have reflected that on these
15:53:33
forms that the doctors would have seen when they saw her;
15:53:36
and two, the doctors, particularly given her smoking
15:53:40
history, even if that wasn't on the usual form, which it
15:53:45
always is, would have asked her specifically about her
15:53:48
condition with respect to smoking and the potential harms
15:53:52
that could flow from smoking.
15:53:53
We know in addition to that, that as late as 1988, she
15:53:59
was working in the yard, helping her husband build a house
15:54:01
without any indication of extreme shortness of breath, of
15:54:08
the kind that would cause somebody to be concerned about
15:54:11
it.
15:54:11
And then we have Dr. Cosmo, who, I'll be candid with
15:54:23
you, I think is an honest man, and testified more or less
   111
15:54:27
 1
as he saw it.  And he testified, in effect, that in his
15:54:32
 2
opinion, as I've already acknowledged, Mrs. Burkhart almost
15:54:36
 3
certainly had some level of COPD prior to this 1990 date.
15:54:40
 4
But then he was asked a question, are you here to
15:54:46
 5
testify that she should have known before then that she had
15:54:52
 6
COPD?  And what did he say?
15:54:56
 7
No.  He doesn't think that at all.  He said patients
15:55:00
 8
are not aware they have COPD.  Patients are not able to
15:55:04
 9
diagnose themselves.  That's why they seek medical help.
15:55:11
Patients are not even aware of the term COPD.  We know
15:55:14
that was the case of Mr. Burkhart.
15:55:18
You know, by the way, emphysema, I suppose, is a
15:55:21
common enough term.  We probably know that from everyday
15:55:24
life.  But chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, I know I
15:55:27
didn't even hear about that until I got involved in these
15:55:30
litigations.
15:55:31
MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  It doesn't
15:55:32
matter what Mr. Heimann thought.
15:55:33
THE COURT:  Overruled.  Overruled.
15:55:36
MR. HEIMANN:  And Dr. Cosmo told us that
15:55:39
patients -- he volunteered this, by the way.  He wasn't
15:55:42
asked, you know, these specific questions.  This was coming
15:55:45
out.
15:55:46
In his experience, patients can have COPD for 20
15:55:49
or 30 years and not know they have it until they see a
   112
15:55:53
 1
doctor and are diagnosed.
15:55:56
 2
So that's the state of the record on this issue of
15:56:00
 3
whether or not Mrs. Burkhart should have known, with the
15:56:03
 4
exercise of reasonable care, that she had COPD prior to May
15:56:09
 5
of 1990.
15:56:10
 6
Let me turn to another topic.  Dr. Cummings and
15:56:24
 7
Dr. Burns, both of these gentleman have been attacked in
15:56:28
 8
the closing arguments.  I say attacked, because that's
15:56:31
 9
really what it amounts to.
15:56:34
Counsel who last spoke to you said they have an
15:56:37
agenda, implying, if not explicitly stating, that they are
15:56:41
testifying falsely before you because they have an agenda.
15:56:43
Because after 30 and 40 years of serving the public health
15:56:51
of this country, both of them, they believe that cigarettes
15:56:59
are a bane in this country because they kill half of the
15:57:04
people who used them.  They are a public health hazard of
15:57:07
an extraordinary level.  And both these gentleman have
15:57:10
lived through that experience as public health officials.
15:57:18
Do you really believe that gives them a reason to
15:57:20
lie when they testify?
15:57:27
Counsel for RJR actually said -- I'm quoting him.
15:57:30
I wrote it down.  I was shocked when he said it -- that
15:57:35
their opinions result -- are the result of millions of
15:57:38
dollars.  That's what he said, that their opinions are the
15:57:42
result of millions of dollars.  Meaning that they're giving
   113
15:57:46
 1
false opinions because they are getting paid.  That's what
15:57:48
 2
he said.  You think that's true?
15:57:57
 3
In the case of Dr. Cummings, virtually every opinion
15:58:00
 4
he expressed and every word he spoke was backed up by a
15:58:03
 5
document from inside the tobacco companies themselves.  He
15:58:07
 6
didn't make up those documents.
15:58:13
 7
As I said, these are two men who long before they came
15:58:18
 8
to earn significant money for the time they spend
15:58:23
 9
testifying in these cases were public servants in the
15:58:29
interest of the public health of this country and of the
15:58:32
citizens of this country.
15:58:33
And that's how they came to the knowledge that enables
15:58:40
them to come into court and testify about the matters that
15:58:44
are in contest in these cases.
15:58:48
And I might also say -- we didn't go through this with
15:58:52
Dr. Burns, but we did with Dr. Cummings, and you know it's
15:58:55
true of Dr. Burns as well -- they never expected to be in
15:58:58
the court, the state and federal courts of Florida
15:59:01
testifying in these Engle trials.  That was the furthest
15:59:05
thing from their minds.  They testified in the class-action
15:59:08
trial, and they thought and expected that was it.
15:59:12
Well, as events turned out, that wasn't it.  And so
15:59:15
they get called into court to testify essentially, in large
15:59:19
part, to the same effect that they testified in the Engle
15:59:21
trial, but they have to do it in individual cases because
   114
15:59:25
 1
that's the way the courts have required these cases to be
15:59:27
 2
tried.
15:59:27
 3
It wasn't our choice, I promise you, to do it this
15:59:30
 4
way.  But when we're forced to do it this way, we have to
15:59:35
 5
call the experts who know what they're talking about.  And
15:59:39
 6
these are two men who stand head and shoulders above
15:59:45
 7
virtually everybody else who could possibly speak
15:59:51
 8
intelligently to the issues that are in play and in contest
15:59:55
 9
in this litigation.
15:59:56
To suggest that their opinions are the result of money
15:59:59
is despicable.
16:00:07
All right.  Let's talk.  We've heard a lot about
16:00:09
choice in the closing arguments here.  Let's talk about
16:00:13
choice.  But let's talk about the defendants' choices.
16:00:19
Their choice -- choice, control, and responsibility.  Let's
16:00:23
talk about the defendants' choices, control, and
16:00:26
responsibility.
16:00:27
It was the -- it was the defendants who chose to
16:00:35
create an environment where it was the social norm to smoke
16:00:37
cigarettes.
16:00:38
Now, I want to come back to something that's been said
16:00:40
time and time again by the defendants.  They said, well,
16:00:43
Mrs. Burkhart didn't start smoking because of any specific
16:00:45
advertisement she saw.  Maybe true.  I don't know.  She
16:00:51
certainly would have seen lots and lots of advertisements
   115
16:00:53
 1
for cigarettes growing up.  Anybody would have who lived --
16:00:58
 2
who grew up in the 1940s, 1950s.  I remember them. 
16:01:08
 3
The FTC and the FDA -- and we submitted this evidence
16:01:11
 4
to you -- have repeatedly said that that advertising, those
16:01:16
 5
advertisings, did cause people to start smoking, to take up
16:01:22
 6
smoking and, in particular, teenagers, to take up smoking.
16:01:26
 7
And the fact that she didn't smoke, if this is true, a
16:01:29
 8
brand that she happened to be seeing the advertisements for
16:01:34
 9
hardly speaks to whether or not advertising had an
16:01:37
influence over her behavior and her starting smoking.
16:01:40
But in addition to that, the culture, I know -- I
16:01:46
don't want to repeat myself too much -- but the culture
16:01:49
itself that existed in the 1950s of smoking was, in large
16:01:53
part, what influenced people like Mrs. Burkhart to take up
16:01:57
smoking because everybody was doing it.  And why was that?
16:02:04
They did it.  That was why it was like that.
16:02:08
The tobacco companies chose to create a product, the
16:02:14
mass-marketed product that was highly addictive.  That was
16:02:18
their choice.
16:02:18
You know, they could have actually made -- you heard
16:02:20
from Dr. Cummings.  They could have made those cigarettes
16:02:23
so they weren't addictive or weren't very addictive.  They
16:02:26
didn't choose that.  They chose to make them addictive.
16:02:29
They chose to engineer their cigarettes to sustain
16:02:32
addiction.
   116
16:02:33
 1
And as I already mentioned this, they chose to create
16:02:36
 2
an environment where there was doubt and controversy about
16:02:39
 3
the health hazards of cigarettes instead of publicly
16:02:43
 4
admitting the hazards.  That was their choice.
16:02:46
 5
Control.  The tobacco companies had the control over
16:02:52
 6
the design of their cigarettes.  They had the control over
16:02:55
 7
the mass marketing of their cigarettes.  They had the
16:02:58
 8
control of their internal studies about the addictive
16:03:03
 9
nature of cigarettes and the research that they conducted.
16:03:06
They had control over the internal studies about the
16:03:08
health dangers of cigarettes.  And we saw that from the
16:03:12
get-go in the early 1950s when they identified dozens of
16:03:16
chemicals in smoke that they realized were carcinogenic,
16:03:21
caused cancer.  And they had control over the decision to
16:03:26
create doubt and controversy over the health dangers of
16:03:31
cigarettes.  Their choices.
16:03:37
And here is what they knew about addiction and free
16:03:47
choice.  We can't defend continued smoking as free choice
16:03:50
if the person was addicted.  But they're doing it, aren't
16:03:53
they?
16:03:55
MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  Violates
16:03:56
Judge Young's ruling of December 27, 2013.
16:03:59
THE COURT:  Very good.  Overruled.  Please, this
16:04:01
is closing argument.
16:04:09
MR. HEIMANN:  So let's look at that issue.  One of
   117
16:04:13
 1
their defenses or arguments, I would characterize it, is
16:04:18
 2
that we can't prove legal causation because Mrs. Burkhart
16:04:22
 3
was capable of quitting even if she was addicted.  And,
16:04:28
 4
therefore, they say that we can't have -- we can't show
16:04:31
 5
legal cause under the law.
16:04:33
 6
But we all know, everyone, at least in theory --
16:04:39
 7
and I would say largely in practice -- is capable
16:04:42
 8
ultimately of breaking addiction, of quitting.  And that
16:04:48
 9
applies not just to cigarettes.  It applies to heroin,
16:04:51
cocaine, any addictive drug.
16:04:53
That's not the issue, though, in this case.  The
16:04:57
question isn't whether or not a person is capable of
16:05:02
breaking through addiction, could break through addiction.
16:05:06
That is -- forgive my artwork.  That's a red
16:05:13
herring.  A red herring, let me tell you, I know you all
16:05:16
know what it means.  But I always like to give the history
16:05:19
of the derivation of this.
16:05:21
So red herring, where does it come from?  In
16:05:24
England, the last century for the most part, the
16:05:27
aristocrats used to hunt foxes.  And they would go on these
16:05:31
galloping hunts on horseback with the fox out in the lead,
16:05:35
and they would have the dogs chasing the fox, and then they
16:05:38
would chase after the dogs.
16:05:39
And the dogs are pretty fast.  So if a fox isn't
16:05:42
particularly good, the hounds get to the fox and really
   118
16:05:45
 1
ruins the hunt because it doesn't last long enough.
16:05:48
 2
So one of the things they used to do is they would
16:05:51
 3
take a dead herring that happens to be red in color --
16:05:54
 4
that's where the red herring comes from -- and the servants
16:05:57
 5
of the aristocrats would get out in front of the hounds, in
16:05:59
 6
between the hounds and the fox, and they'd run that red
16:06:01
 7
herring across the path where the fox had gone.  And that
16:06:04
 8
would cause the hounds to lose the scent of the fox and go
16:06:06
 9
off in the wrong direction.  That's where red herring comes
16:06:09
from.
16:06:09
And that's what this stuff about, well, she could
16:06:14
have quit.  That's a red herring.  That's to throw you off
16:06:18
of the true path of what really matters in this litigation,
16:06:21
to give you -- take you in the wrong direction.
16:06:24
That's not the test of legal cause, whether or not
16:06:26
she was a person, like Mrs. Burkhart, is capable of
16:06:29
quitting or might have quitted.
16:06:31
The legal cause -- and I know I showed you this
16:06:36
before.  Here's the key.  Addiction is a cause of disease
16:06:41
if it -- as long as the addiction contributes substantially
16:06:45
to producing the disease.
16:06:46
And so the question isn't whether she could have
16:06:55
quit.  The question is, why did she continue to smoke
16:07:03
cigarettes?  Why did she continue to persist in smoking
16:07:06
cigarettes?
   119
16:07:08
 1
And the answer to that, without question, is
16:07:13
 2
addiction to nicotine.  And here -- I know I showed you
16:07:17
 3
this in my opening argument.  The question here is was
16:07:20
 4
addiction a substantial part of the reason that
16:07:24
 5
Mrs. Burkhart persisted in smoking cigarettes.
16:07:28
 6
The alternative was, was addiction only a trivial
16:07:32
 7
or inconsequential part of the reason that she continued to
16:07:35
 8
smoke cigarettes?  And I think the answer couldn't be
16:07:38
 9
clearer that given what you now know about, if you didn't
16:07:43
know it before, addiction based on the evidence that's been
16:07:45
presented in this case, it's the addiction that is the
16:07:48
fundamental reason that people like Mrs. Burkhart continue
16:07:52
to smoke cigarettes, even knowing that it's likely to be
16:07:56
harmful to their health.
16:07:57
That's why they do it.  And the fact that they
16:08:02
might have quit, in theory could have quit, are capable of
16:08:08
quitting, or as in Mrs. Burkhart's case, ultimately did
16:08:11
quit, has nothing whatsoever to do with the legal question
16:08:14
of legal cause.
16:08:15
MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  Misstates
16:08:18
the Florida Supreme Court ruling.
16:08:20
THE COURT:  Overruled.
16:08:23
MR. HEIMANN:  It may be relevant, by the way, to
16:08:25
the question of comparative fault because you might very
16:08:29
well find in terms of trying to figure out what degree of
   120
16:08:32
 1
fault Mrs. Burkhart should bear here that she should have
16:08:35
 2
tried harder earlier on, she should have tried more often.
16:08:43
 3
Of course, anybody can try harder and anybody can try more
16:08:46
 4
often.  So you may want to take that into account in
16:08:49
 5
assessing what degree of culpability in terms of fault
16:08:54
 6
Mrs. Burkhart shares with the defendants.  But it doesn't
16:08:56
 7
have anything whatsoever to do with the issue of legal
16:09:00
 8
cause.
16:09:09
 9
You know, there's really a great deal of hypocrisy
16:09:15
at work here in the defense that you've been hearing.  In
16:09:23
the real world, before we came to court, these companies
16:09:25
denied day in and day out, week in and week out, year in
16:09:32
and year out that smoking was harmful, sought in every way
16:09:35
to create doubt about it, to create a controversy about it,
16:09:38
said it didn't happen.
16:09:39
You saw them.  We showed you them on TV shows.  We
16:09:42
showed you the documents where they continually did that
16:09:45
for what?  Started in '54, and they didn't admit it until
16:09:49
the year 2000.
16:09:51
But now they come into court -- or when they are
16:09:53
hauled into court, I should say, they say, well, we don't
16:09:57
blame the smoker.  But they do.  And they want you to blame
16:10:02
Mrs. Burkhart as the smoker.
16:10:05
Why?  Because she did exactly what they wanted her
16:10:09
to do, urged her to do, did everything in their power to
   121
16:10:13
 1
get her to do.  And now, if that's not hypocrisy, I don't
16:10:16
 2
know what is.
16:10:17
 3
Another argument, choice.  Choice.  Another red
16:10:26
 4
herring.
16:10:32
 5
All addicts choose to use their drug of addiction.
16:10:38
 6
in the sense that they're not held down and have a needle
16:10:42
 7
stuck in their arm and heroin injected.  They do it
16:10:46
 8
themselves.  In that sense, it's true.  They choose.
16:10:52
 9
They're not unconscious.
16:10:58
But the question in this case is why?  Why do
16:11:03
addicts choose to continue using the addictive substance?
16:11:08
Why?  Addiction.  That's why.
16:11:20
And that's why the correct question is the one
16:11:24
that I gave you a moment ago.  Did her addiction contribute
16:11:30
substantially to her persistent use of cigarettes.
16:11:37
You heard from -- I think both Dr. Cummings and
16:11:39
Dr. Burns addressed this point how addiction constrains,
16:11:45
limits, interferes with free choice.  An addict doesn't
16:11:50
have free choice.  An addict's choice is hampered by
16:11:57
addiction.
16:12:03
In fact, we showed you this.  This is from the
16:12:08
guide to the most recent Surgeon General's report from 2014
16:12:12
where this very issue is addressed.  The reality is that
16:12:16
smoking is not usually a choice.  For most smokers, tobacco
16:12:21
is an addiction, and nicotine is the primary drug in
   122
16:12:26
 1
tobacco that causes addiction.
16:12:27
 2
That's, in fact, the view of the Surgeon Generals
16:12:35
 3
and of the scientific and health community, not this
16:12:39
 4
nonsense that counsel shows you snippets from Surgeon
16:12:42
 5
General reports that are dealing with secondhand smoke and
16:12:46
 6
happen to use a term that they can seize on to claim that
16:12:51
 7
the Surgeon General is saying that smoking is a choice.
16:12:55
 8
That's just not true.  That's not the Surgeon General's
16:12:57
 9
view.  It's not the health community's view.  It's not the
16:13:00
medical community's view.  It's only their view and only in
16:13:04
court.  
16:13:14
I posed this question to you before, and I'll do
16:13:16
it again.  Do you really believe -- do you really believe,
16:13:19
that Mrs. Burkhart, an intelligent, educated woman, would
16:13:24
smoke cigarettes day in and day out, one pack a day, two
16:13:29
pack a day, three pack a day, over 35 years if she wasn't
16:13:34
addicted?
16:13:35
If she wasn't addicted, she could have put them
16:13:39
down at will at any time.  In a sense, it's an insult to
16:13:47
suggest the addiction wasn't what really was causing her to
16:13:51
continue to smoke cigarettes.  This is an insult to her
16:13:54
intelligence.  It's an insult to my intelligence.  It's an
16:13:57
insult to your intelligence.
16:13:59
The defendants argue, well, if she had quit
16:14:09
sooner, she might not have come down with COPD.  No
   123
16:14:15
 1
question about that.
16:14:15
 2
But on the other hand, if the defendants hadn't
16:14:18
 3
marketed to kids in the time when Mrs. Burkhart was a child
16:14:23
 4
growing up, and a teenager, they hadn't manipulated
16:14:27
 5
nicotine to make cigarettes as addictive as possible, if
16:14:30
 6
they had come clean and told the truth, well, maybe we
16:14:33
 7
wouldn't be here then.
16:14:38
 8
Why did they wait in until the year 2000 to
16:14:42
 9
finally admit what they had known all along about the
16:14:45
health hazards of cigarettes and the addictive nature of
16:14:48
cigarettes?
16:14:49
So you heard in the closing arguments,
16:15:00
particularly from counsel for RJR, representations, one
16:15:10
after the other, about what he thinks the testimony was in
16:15:12
this case.
16:15:12
And he repeated the same things over and over and
16:15:17
over again that he claimed the witnesses had testified to,
16:15:20
not just Mr. and Mrs. Burkhart, but some of the experts as
16:15:24
well.
16:15:24
Some lawyers think -- and I've been doing this a
16:15:34
long time so I've got experience when I talk about this.
16:15:36
Some lawyers think that if they misstate the evidence often
16:15:40
enough --
16:15:41
MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's
16:15:42
personal attack.  That's not argument.
   124
16:15:44
 1
THE COURT:  Overruled.  It was done both
16:15:45
 2
directions.  I just simply remind the jury that this is
16:15:48
 3
closing argument.  Counsels' statements are not evidence.
16:15:53
 4
MR. HEIMANN:  If they take testimony out of
16:15:54
 5
context over and over again, that somehow the jury will
16:16:02
 6
accept the lawyer's view and version of what the testimony
16:16:07
 7
was and the evidence was.
16:16:11
 8
I happen to disagree in large respect with how the
16:16:15
 9
evidence was described and characterized.  But I'm not
16:16:17
going to tell you what I think the evidence was.  I told
16:16:21
you I wasn't going to try and do that at the outset.
16:16:24
That's your function.  You decide what the witnesses
16:16:28
testified to and the import of that testimony, not the
16:16:32
lawyers.
16:16:35
And I think I don't need to tell you that you
16:16:37
ought to take with a grain of salt anything that one of the
16:16:42
lawyers, including me, has to say about what the evidence
16:16:44
was in the case because, obviously, talk about bias, we're
16:16:48
as biased as we can be here.  That doesn't mean that we're
16:16:54
dishonest.  I certainly hope we're not.  But that bias has
16:16:57
a tendency to spin, to allow you to look over things that
16:17:03
really were said, and to mischaracterize things that were
16:17:07
said.
16:17:07
A couple of specifics in this regard, for example.
16:17:18
Counsel for RJR showed you a snippet -- I think it was from
   125
16:17:23
 1
the 2010 Surgeon General report that was talking about
16:17:25
 2
relapse.  Nobody was asked to testify -- nobody who knows
16:17:28
 3
what they're talking about was asked to testify about this
16:17:31
 4
little sentence that he pointed to you and read from and
16:17:34
 5
then interpreted, lawyer interpreting what the Surgeon
16:17:38
 6
General has to say.
16:17:40
 7
I, quite frankly -- when I read that, I'm not
16:17:43
 8
quite sure what it means, and I wouldn't try -- pretend to
16:17:46
 9
try and tell you.  If I wanted you to hear about that, I
16:17:49
would have asked the expert witnesses who know what they
16:17:51
are talking about about it.  But he took it upon himself to
16:17:54
tell you what it means from the Surgeon General's report.
16:17:57
And he claimed, at least as I understood what he
16:18:00
was saying, that it meant that the Surgeon General was
16:18:02
saying addiction really isn't the reason that people smoke
16:18:05
cigarettes.  At least, that's the import I took from what
16:18:08
he said.  Well, if that's what he meant to say -- and I do
16:18:12
believe that's what he meant to communicate to you -- it's
16:18:15
wrong, dead wrong.
16:18:16
Let's take a look at what the Surgeon General
16:18:22
actually says about the subject.  This is from that --
16:18:31
I need slide 83.
16:18:35
So this is from -- I showed you this earlier.
16:18:42
This is from the 2010 report, and it's repeating what was
16:18:45
said in the '88 report.  Cigarettes and other forms of
   126
16:18:49
 1
tobacco are addicting.  Nicotine is the drug in tobacco
16:18:51
 2
that causes addiction.  The pharmacological and behavioral
16:18:55
 3
processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to
16:18:57
 4
those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and
16:19:02
 5
cocaine.
16:19:03
 6
84, if I could, please, Keith.
16:19:06
 7
This is what the Surgeon General actually believes
16:19:09
 8
the relationship between addiction and sustained use,
16:19:13
 9
persistent use of cigarettes is.
16:19:17
Sustained use and long-term exposures to tobacco
16:19:20
smoke are due to powerfully addicting effects of tobacco
16:19:24
products.  Nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason
16:19:27
that individuals persist in using tobacco products, and
16:19:30
this persistent tobacco use contributes to the many
16:19:34
diseases described in the report.
16:19:35
And I know I've already told you this.  That
16:19:38
includes, to be sure, COPD.
16:19:46
All right.  We can take that down for the moment.
16:19:48
Counsel for RJR also in his argument, in
16:19:52
addressing -- I think he was trying to address the issue of
16:19:56
the award of punitive damages -- tried to make out as if
16:20:02
that the cigarette companies had actually improved
16:20:04
cigarettes from the standpoint of health hazard by such
16:20:09
things as reduction of the tobacco or reduction of
16:20:14
nicotine.  I'm not quite sure what it was all about,
   127
16:20:16
 1
frankly.  And filters.
16:20:18
 2
And he cited to several Surgeon General reports
16:20:21
 3
that he claims support that notion.  He cited to the '79
16:20:25
 4
report, to the '81 report, to the '89 report, and to the
16:20:29
 5
1990 report, which you already know from the evidence in
16:20:33
 6
this case that -- and this was Dr. Proctor -- I think it
16:20:38
 7
was Dr. Proctor primarily, but it may have been Dr. Burns
16:20:42
 8
as well -- that the conclusions to the extent there are
16:20:46
 9
statements in those reports that suggested it appeared that
16:20:50
cigarettes were becoming less hazardous, those statements
16:20:53
turned out to be dead wrong, dead wrong.
16:20:59
And I'll ask you this.  Maybe I can't ask you to
16:21:03
answer it out loud, but answer it rhetorically.
16:21:05
What do all of these Surgeon General reports that
16:21:09
he cites to have in common that's important?  They all come
16:21:16
before the internal documents of the tobacco companies were
16:21:18
made available in the late 1990s.  Because once those
16:21:23
documents became available and were reviewed and read by
16:21:27
the public health authorities and the Surgeon General, they
16:21:31
shed enormous light on why the Surgeon General and the
16:21:36
public health authorities had been mistaken and reached
16:21:39
conclusions that were wrong before they got ahold of
16:21:42
that -- of the research and the studies that are inside
16:21:44
those documents that were kept from, kept from the public
16:21:49
health authorities by these companies all those years and
   128
16:21:52
 1
were only coughed up when they were forced to turn them
16:21:57
 2
over.
16:21:57
 3
Let's just take a little bit of what these say.
16:22:00
 4
I'm going to -- I'm going to start with -- let's see.  It's
16:22:04
 5
Exhibit 237.  We've talked about this before.  It's the
16:22:09
 6
Surgeon General's report from the year 2010.  And it's
16:22:12
 7
talking about the earlier conclusions that had been reached
16:22:16
 8
by the public health authorities that counsel was citing to
16:22:21
 9
you in his closing argument.
16:22:23
And among other things, the Surgeon General report
16:22:25
here says, unfortunately, with the accrual and evaluation
16:22:29
of additional data, meaning data in addition to what had
16:22:32
been available back in the day, the evidence today does not
16:22:36
demonstrate that efforts to lower machine-measured tar and
16:22:40
nicotine yields actually decreased the health risks of
16:22:44
smoking.  Primarily because these changes did not reduce
16:22:48
smokers' actual exposure to tobacco toxicants. 
16:22:53
Indeed, to the extent that filters and other
16:22:59
efforts to reduce machine-measured tar and nicotine reduced
16:23:03
smokers' health concerns and thereby delayed quitting
16:23:08
and/or increased cigarette use, they may have contributed
16:23:11
to an increase, overall increase, in cigarette-caused
16:23:15
mortality, meaning death.
16:23:17
And further, I don't have it to put up in front
16:23:36
you, although in a minute -- I'll put it up, some from the
   129
16:23:42
 1
same report.
16:23:42
 2
A variety of design features made it possible --
16:23:45
 3
they're talking about design features that the tobacco
16:23:47
 4
companies employed in their cigarettes -- made it possible
16:23:50
 5
for cigarette smokers to compensate, that is, easily ingest
16:23:55
 6
several fold higher amounts of tar and nicotine than the
16:23:59
 7
yields obtained when using the machine-based FTC method.
16:24:03
 8
And it was the machine-based FTC method that the
16:24:06
 9
Surgeon General was relying upon in the earlier reports
16:24:10
when it came to the erroneous conclusions that it now
16:24:13
realized when it got ahold of the tobacco company
16:24:15
documents.
16:24:16
Let me go to 87, Keith.
16:24:25
So this is a little difficult for you all to read
16:24:35
because it's in such small type.  I apologize for that.
16:24:38
But this is where they talk about the specific point about
16:24:41
tobacco documents.  Tobacco industry documents, many of
16:24:44
which are available at the Legacy Documents Library at
16:24:48
UCSF -- those are the very documents we're talking about
16:24:52
that were obtained for the first time in the late 1990s --
16:24:55
clearly demonstrate that at least by the mid-1970s, the
16:24:59
tobacco industry well understood the importance of creating
16:25:03
health reassurance messages in order to alleviate health
16:25:07
concerns and that one important method of doing so was
16:25:10
through claims of low deliveries of tar.
   130
16:25:14
 1
For example, in 1977, British American Tobacco
16:25:17
 2
marketing report concluded, all work in this area should be
16:25:21
 3
directed towards providing consumer reassurance about
16:25:29
 4
cigarettes and the smoking habit.  This can be provided in
16:25:31
 5
different ways, for example, by claimed low deliveries, by
16:25:34
 6
the perception of low deliveries, and by the perception of
16:25:37
 7
mildness.
16:25:38
 8
And I believe you'll find that that's exactly what
16:25:43
 9
Mrs. Burkhart was talking about when she was talking about
16:25:44
the decisions that she made in terms of going to filter
16:25:47
cigarettes and light cigarettes with.  That's for you to
16:25:50
judge in terms of what your understanding of the testimony
16:25:52
was.
16:25:52
At the same time, tobacco company documents also
16:25:56
clearly demonstrate that the industry understood that
16:26:00
smokers would not achieve the claimed deliveries because of
16:26:03
smoker compensation.
16:26:07
And dropping down to the next paragraph, in
16:26:09
contrast to industry awareness, the various ways that
16:26:13
cigarettes were physically modified and the nature and
16:26:15
level of compensation in response to design changes were
16:26:19
not well understood by parties outside of the tobacco
16:26:22
industry.  Public itself.
16:26:27
Public health officials had little basis to
16:26:29
anticipate the degree to which manufacturers could design
   131
16:26:33
 1
cigarettes to allow smokers to draw more smoke and nicotine
16:26:36
 2
from cigarettes than was represented by machine-measured
16:26:40
 3
yields of tar and nicotine.
16:26:41
 4
But the tobacco companies did.  They knew about
16:26:44
 5
that.  They studied that.  They researched that.  They
16:26:49
 6
designed their cigarettes to have what they called an
16:26:51
 7
elasticity so that smokers could get more tar, more
16:26:55
 8
nicotine than the government understood were being
16:27:00
 9
delivered by those products.
16:27:02
I could go on.  But I would just invite you in
16:27:11
your deliberation, if you want to see more of this, this is
16:27:15
Exhibit 237.  And I'm looking at pages -- page 16 in
16:27:21
chapter 2 and page 17 in chapter 2 where all of this is
16:27:26
spelled out.
16:27:27
In addition, in the 2014 report, the most recent
16:27:40
report from the Surgeon General --
16:27:54
Can we have slide 85, please?
16:28:01
What the Surgeon General concluded in the year
16:28:03
2014, his report was that not only had cigarettes not
16:28:07
gotten safer over time, they had gotten more dangerous as a
16:28:12
result of design changes that these companies made into
16:28:15
their products.
16:28:16
The century-long epidemic of cigarette smoking has
16:28:20
caused an enormous avoidable public health tragedy.
16:28:25
Since the first Surgeon General's report in 1964,
   132
16:28:27
 1
more than 20 million premature deaths can be attributed to
16:28:31
 2
cigarette smoking.
16:28:32
 3
If you'd go to 86, please, Keith.
16:28:35
 4
The tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been
16:28:38
 5
sustained by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco
16:28:42
 6
industry, which has deliberately misled the public on the
16:28:46
 7
risks of smoking cigarettes.
16:28:48
 8
And out of that same report, at page 8, from
16:28:55
 9
chapter 1 -- I don't think I have a slide on this.  But,
16:28:58
again, this is Exhibit 1704, you see.
16:29:02
This was the conclusion.
16:29:04
The evidence is sufficient to conclude -- well,
16:29:09
let me stop.
16:29:10
Under lung cancer, the evidence is sufficient to
16:29:12
conclude that the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the
16:29:17
lung from cigarette smoking has increased since the 1960s.
16:29:22
The evidence is sufficient to conclude that the
16:29:23
increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung in smokers
16:29:30
results from changes in the design and composition of
16:29:33
cigarettes since the 1950s.
16:29:35
Changes in the design that they put into their
16:29:37
cigarettes.  And you heard from Dr. Cummings why.  Increase
16:29:40
the addictiveness of the cigarettes.  Get it deeper into
16:29:42
the lung.  And the deeper into the lung that smoke goes,
16:29:45
the more adenocarcinoma as opposed to small cell --
   133
16:29:50
 1
squa-cell, something like that, other type of cancer that
16:29:54
 2
used to be the primary cancer from cigarettes.
16:29:57
 3
Finally on -- just briefly on this Tobacco Working
16:30:05
 4
Group.  I laugh at this from time to time.
16:30:08
 5
That's the ten-year effort where the tobacco
16:30:10
 6
companies supposedly cooperated with the government in
16:30:13
 7
trying to find a way to create a safer cigarette.  We
16:30:17
 8
showed you the documents in the course of the trial that
16:30:19
 9
showed that, in fact, to a large extent, the tobacco
16:30:25
company's cooperation was a sham.
16:30:27
And I know we gave you two documents.  One was at
16:30:30
the very outset, where I think it was Lorillard's
16:30:32
president -- I may be wrong about that.  It's in
16:30:35
evidence -- wrote back and said, yeah, I'll participate,
16:30:37
but I don't agree for a second that the cigarettes that are
16:30:40
currently made are not safe.  And, therefore, we don't see
16:30:42
any real point to this because we don't admit that
16:30:45
cigarettes are not safe.  But I'll come along and I'll sit
16:30:48
in on your meetings, basically.
16:30:50
And then you saw the document from about five or
16:30:52
six or seven years later where it was the committee of
16:30:54
counsel, lawyers, who are deciding whether or not the
16:30:58
tobacco companies would continue to participate in this
16:31:01
product.  Not researchers, the lawyers.
16:31:03
And they wanted to pull out at the time, but they
   134
16:31:06
 1
decided they couldn't do that.  Why?  Because it would be
16:31:09
 2
bad public relations.
16:31:11
 3
But they then said, you know, you may remember
16:31:13
 4
this document.  They said, well, look, we'll continue but
16:31:16
 5
we want to make sure that we -- that we do things like
16:31:20
 6
tell -- I think it was Gori who was the head of the project
16:31:25
 7
at the time for the government -- we want to tell Gori that
16:31:26
 8
he's got to back off on things like smoking cessation
16:31:30
 9
clinics, if they were going to continue to participate.
16:31:33
So the Tobacco Working Group, while it may have
16:31:35
had a very admirable goal and aim from the government's
16:31:39
point of view, although totally unsuccessful in the end,
16:31:41
wasn't endorsed in any serious way, according to the
16:31:46
evidence that is in this case by the tobacco companies
16:31:48
themselves.
16:31:49
All right.  I'm coming to my end here.
16:31:51
You know, is it really too much to expect the
16:32:02
manufacturer of a product that's sold in this country to be
16:32:06
honest?  I mean, is it really?
16:32:09
Is it really too much to expect and they will
16:32:13
admit when their products are harmful or potentially
16:32:17
harmful?  To much to expect them to acknowledge when their
16:32:23
products are dangerous?  Or as in this case, deadly.
16:32:36
All of the tobacco companies that are in court
16:32:39
here today earned enormous profits in the first half of the
   135
16:32:42
 1
20th century from the sale of cigarettes.
16:32:55
 2
I don't often talk in Biblical terms, but I think
16:33:00
 3
it's justified here.  In the 1950s, these companies came to
16:33:03
 4
a crossroads.  They had two paths they could take when they
16:33:08
 5
knew for sure how deadly their products were.
16:33:13
 6
They could have taken the righteous path -- 
16:33:16
 7
MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.
16:33:17
 8
THE COURT:  Overruled.
16:33:22
 9
MR. HEIMANN:  They could have --
16:33:24
THE COURT:  It's argument.
16:33:25
MR. HEIMANN:  -- been truthful and honest.  They
16:33:27
could have, if they wanted to continue selling
16:33:31
cigarettes -- I don't know that would have been the best
16:33:33
choice, but okay.
16:33:35
They could have said to the American public, look,
16:33:38
we're going to continue to sell these products, but you
16:33:40
have to understand that the scientists are right, they
16:33:44
cause cancer.  You'd better think twice if you're going to
16:33:49
take up smoking or continue smoking.
16:33:53
And they could have said, well, we're going to do
16:33:56
our best to find out if we can identify and remove the
16:34:02
harmful cancer-causing and other health-affecting
16:34:05
substances.
16:34:07
But we can't do it now.  We know we can't do it
16:34:09
now.  We found that out.  So we don't know whether we're
   136
16:34:12
 1
going to ever be able to do it or not.  They could have
16:34:16
 2
done that.
16:34:17
 3
Now, would that have had an impact of sales of
16:34:21
 4
cigarettes in this country?  I sure hope so.  I believe it
16:34:23
 5
would have.  And I believe you can find that it's more
16:34:26
 6
likely than not that it would have.
16:34:27
 7
But they chose a different path.  They chose --
16:34:39
 8
there's just no other word for it -- evil.  They chose the
16:34:42
 9
path of evil.
16:34:45
MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.
16:34:46
THE COURT:  Overruled.
16:34:46
But remember that's counsel's characterization.
16:34:49
That's not in the evidence.
16:34:55
MR. HEIMANN:  They chose to lie.  They chose to do
16:34:58
what they could to make their cigarettes even worse in
16:35:01
terms of addiction.  They chose to tell the public that
16:35:06
they would take -- that they were going to find out what
16:35:10
was in the cigarettes, if anything, that was harmful, and
16:35:12
they were going to remove it.
16:35:14
Mrs. Burkhart heard that.  At least as I
16:35:18
understood her testimony.
16:35:19
And as I said before, when they made this choice,
16:35:26
it wasn't as if they thought that cigarettes were just
16:35:29
risky.  Because from their point of view, the harm they
16:35:32
were going to do and continue to do was a certainty.  They
   137
16:35:35
 1
knew it would happen.
16:35:36
 2
I need to get to slide 80.
16:35:43
 3
I've shown you this before.  There we go.  And
16:35:49
 4
here's the cost that we, the American people, paid.
16:36:05
 5
So, think about this.  And this goes back to
16:36:10
 6
something I said in my earlier argument to you.  Think
16:36:13
 7
about it.  What if they had chosen the righteous path, they
16:36:17
 8
had been honest, they admitted to the public how dangerous
16:36:20
 9
their products were, and that they cause cancer, they cause
16:36:24
COPD, they cause other diseases?
16:36:25
There would be no doubt -- there would have been
16:36:31
no doubt, no controversy, no psychological crutch for
16:36:35
people like Mrs. Burkhart.  The world would have changed.
16:36:45
The world would have changed.
16:36:48
And I think the evidence is sufficient for you to
16:36:53
find that had that happened, Mrs. Burkhart would have quit
16:36:57
smoking.  She would have broken through that addiction, if
16:37:04
they had just chosen the righteous path.
16:37:07
Thank you.
