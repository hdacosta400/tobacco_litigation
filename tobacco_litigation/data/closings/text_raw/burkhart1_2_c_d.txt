CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE 
11:52:12
MR. BELASIC:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
   160
11:52:19
 1
It's the last time I'll be able to talk to you.  You know
11:52:21
 2
what we're here for.
11:52:37
 3
We know that we're here to -- we're here to decide
11:52:43
 4
-- you're here to decide.
11:52:54
 5
THE COURT:  Are you hearing that, ma'am?  Tap it.
11:52:56
 6
We may have to detach the battery and reattach it, or no.
11:53:05
 7
MR. BELASIC:  There we go.
11:53:07
 8
Y'all know that we're here to decide whether
11:53:10
 9
punitive damages should be awarded.  You know that
11:53:18
defendants have a right to present an aggressive defense
11:53:21
just as all of us would be if we were sued.
11:53:24
You know that at times that I presented an
11:53:26
aggressive defense.  You saw that when the plaintiff's
11:53:30
expert witnesses who've been paid large amounts of money
11:53:33
took the stand, that I aggressively pointed out the
11:53:36
evidence that I believe supported our position.
11:53:38
You reached the following verdict:  You decided
11:53:40
that the concealment of material information harmed
11:53:44
Mrs. Burkhart and was a partial cause of her injury.
11:53:46
That's your verdict.  We've heard your verdict.
11:53:49
We respect your verdict.  And I don't dispute your verdict.
11:53:52
So last night into the wee, small hours I thought
11:53:56
about the evidence that you had seen.  I thought about the
11:53:59
verdict that you found that concealment of material
11:54:02
information caused, in part, Mrs. Burkhart's injury.
   161
11:54:07
 1
I thought about the evidence that you had seen on
11:54:09
 2
both sides from the tobacco companies and the evidence from
11:54:13
 3
Mrs. Burkhart.  No one will dispute.  You are the only
11:54:17
 4
judges of the facts, and you are the only ones who have
11:54:20
 5
seen the evidence on Mrs. Burkhart.  
11:54:21
 6
The Engle jury never saw the witnesses you've
11:54:24
 7
seen.  They never saw any evidence about Mrs. Burkhart.  So
11:54:28
 8
your decision, concealment harmed her, it stands.
11:54:32
 9
I know that you also reached a decision on whether
11:54:38
Mrs. Burkhart's behavior and her actions and her choices
11:54:40
caused, in part, her injury.  And you know that in contrast
11:54:46
to an aggressive approach that we took with the experts,
11:54:48
that when I examined Mrs. Burkhart, I was appropriately
11:54:52
respectful and I was gentle.  You got to see her testimony.
11:54:56
You've seen the videotape of her prior testimony.
11:54:58
And so what your verdict tells us at the same time
11:55:01
is that you also found that Mrs. Burkhart was a partial
11:55:05
legal cause of her COPD.
11:55:06
Now, Mr. Heimann used an example yesterday -- or I
11:55:13
guess it was two days ago now -- he said of intentional
11:55:17
misconduct where the driver sees a pedestrian.  They just
11:55:21
speed up, and they try to run her over.
11:55:23
Well, I submit to you that that's not the facts of
11:55:25
this case, and that's not your verdict.  That's not what
11:55:30
you decided.  You decided that both the tobacco companies
   162
11:55:35
 1
here today and Mrs. Burkhart were the cause of her injury.
11:55:40
 2
In fact, when you apportioned the fault that
11:55:43
 3
Mr. Heimann just talked about, you found that the tobacco
11:55:46
 4
companies and Mrs. Burkhart were both 50 percent
11:55:51
 5
responsible for causing her harm.
11:55:52
 6
And so I submit to you that Mr. Heimann's example
11:55:56
 7
isn't the example that warrants an additional award of
11:56:02
 8
money over the $5 million that you've already assessed her.
11:56:05
 9
This is not a case where someone ran over a pedestrian.
11:56:09
This is not a case where the person with a horrible disease
11:56:14
has had no influence or no control.  You have found both
11:56:18
parties were equally responsible for causing.
11:56:21
And I ask you respectfully that when you consider
11:56:24
should Mr. Burkhart be awarded additional money, whether
11:56:28
you think it was punishment or deterrence, that you
11:56:31
consider the difference between this case and the type of
11:56:38
case where a defendant is the only cause.
11:56:40
Your Honor, I've decided to allocate 25 minutes
11:56:51
out of the 45.  With your permission, I'd like to have Jose
11:56:53
tell me when there's five minutes left.  Would that be all
11:56:56
right?
11:56:56
THE COURT:  Yes.
11:56:58
MR. BELASIC:  Now, the first thing you're going to
11:56:59
see in Judge Jones' instructions as he read to you is that
11:57:01
despite your finding, you have the discretion whether or
   163
11:57:04
 1
not -- you are absolutely not required to award punitive
11:57:08
 2
damages.
11:57:08
 3
And I've already talked about that.  I'm going to
11:57:11
 4
talk about more why I think in this case you should
11:57:13
 5
exercise your discretion to not give more than the
11:57:16
 6
$5 million that you have already awarded Mrs. Burkhart.
11:57:20
 7
It's up to you.  The instruction says, you will
11:57:24
 8
decide whether.  Whether it's a zero or a dollar or I guess
11:57:29
 9
Mr. Heimann thinks it should be $25 million.
11:57:32
One of the things you should consider is this
11:57:34
money goes to Mrs. Burkhart.  Mr. Heimann said, well,
11:57:38
you're going to a protector of society.  Well, that money
11:57:42
will only go to her.  It won't go to any other
11:57:44
organization.
11:57:45
Let's talk about what you found when you awarded
11:57:50
Mrs. Burkhart $5 million for her injuries.  The first thing
11:57:52
we know is that, obviously, you found her injuries were
11:57:56
substantial.  You wouldn't have awarded millions of dollars
11:57:56
otherwise.  
11:57:59
But what we also know -- and what we know from
11:58:03
Judge Jones' instructions and what we know from your
11:58:06
faithful exercise of those instructions is that the
11:58:09
$5 million that you've awarded is the full, reasonable, and
11:58:13
just compensation that she deserves for her injuries.  In
11:58:18
other words, you have already fully compensated
   164
11:58:22
 1
Mrs. Burkhart.
11:58:24
 2
Punitive damages are completely different.  When
11:58:27
 3
you were instructed in phase one, jury instruction number
11:58:31
 4
11 said specifically that if you found the defendants
11:58:35
 5
liable in part or in whole, you should decide and must
11:58:38
 6
award the amount that was full; you did that.  The amount
11:58:42
 7
that was just; you did that.  And the amount that was
11:58:46
 8
reasonable.
11:58:47
 9
And so, in other words, by fulfilling your duty --
11:58:50
and no one here disputes your finding.  By fulfilling your
11:58:54
duty, you have already determined that Mrs. Burkhart has
11:58:56
been awarded every penny, every penny that she deserves for
11:59:02
the substantial injuries that you have found.
11:59:04
The issue is whether she should receive, as
11:59:09
Mr. Heimann says, another $25 million on top of that.  And
11:59:13
I think the evidence here clearly supports no.
11:59:15
We know that the punitive damages won't go to
11:59:19
protect other people from smoking.  They won't go to public
11:59:23
health agencies or smoking cessation clinics.  They'll go
11:59:28
frequently to Mrs. Burkhart.  We know that it is not going
11:59:31
to fund any stop smoking programs.
11:59:34
Instead, as you've been told, in deciding whether
11:59:39
any punitive damages should be awarded, you're supposed to
11:59:42
consider punishment and deterrence.  And I'm going to ask
11:59:45
you to think about a few things when we look at the
   165
11:59:47
 1
evidence on whether punishing these companies by giving
11:59:51
 2
Mrs. Burkhart millions of additional dollars would deter
11:59:54
 3
any future action.
11:59:55
 4
That's the question.  Do you need to award
12:00:00
 5
Mrs. Burkhart millions of dollars in money to get Reynolds
12:00:05
 6
and Lorillard and Philip Morris to change what you found
12:00:09
 7
they did wrong?
12:00:10
 8
Well, you've seen the evidence.  Reynolds and
12:00:13
 9
Philip Morris and Lorillard, too, are very different.
12:00:15
Mr. Heimann belittles it, but it's undisputed.  They all
12:00:18
have new owners.  They all have new CEOs.
12:00:22
The people that you saw from the 1950s, the 1970s,
12:00:25
the 1990s, they're no longer in charge.  The Claude Teagues
12:00:32
of 1953, the Alan Rodgmans of 1959, they're long gone or
12:00:37
dead.
12:00:37
The people that you have punished today are not
12:00:39
the people who committed the wrongdoing that you found.  So
12:00:42
you have to ask yourself if punishment by giving
12:00:45
Mrs. Burkhart additional millions would actually be the
12:00:48
proper punishment to the people who are now long gone.
12:00:53
And Mr. Heimann, again, said, well, they're still
12:00:55
the same companies.  But the evidence is undisputed that
12:00:59
they are not.  You were told that there was a conspiracy by
12:01:04
a group named CTR that started in 1953.  The men that
12:01:08
signed that paper are either long gone and probably long
   166
12:01:11
 1
dead.
12:01:11
 2
We know from their own expert that by the 1990s,
12:01:15
 3
that organization was disbanded.  How can you say -- how
12:01:18
 4
can Mr. Heimann say that the companies haven't changed?
12:01:22
 5
How can he say that when the Tobacco Institute has been
12:01:25
 6
gone for 15 years?
12:01:26
 7
There's no more agreement.  There's no more
12:01:30
 8
organization going on the news to disagree with the Surgeon
12:01:32
 9
General.  There's no more public dispute.  That has
12:01:36
completely changed.
12:01:37
And we know that Reynolds and Philip Morris and
12:01:41
Lorillard's websites, they all agree that they publicly
12:01:44
state that smoking causes COPD and that smoking is
12:01:47
addictive.  Remember, Mr. Heimann argued.  If they had done
12:01:52
that for Mrs. Burkhart, he argued that they should have
12:01:56
done that in the past.
12:01:57
How can you say they haven't changed?  They are
12:02:00
officially saying and agreeing with the Surgeon General
12:02:02
that their products cause disease.  They're making the
12:02:05
statement.  They're making the admission that the plaintiff
12:02:08
argued they should have.
12:02:09
They have changed.  We know there's no more
12:02:13
agreement to dispute.  You've heard the witnesses say that
12:02:17
the companies never publicly criticize or attack the
12:02:22
Surgeon General.
   167
12:02:23
 1
They say on their websites that smokers should
12:02:25
 2
quit.  Reynolds goes out of its way to help them quit by
12:02:30
 3
selling smoking cessation products so they can stop buying
12:02:34
 4
cigarettes.
12:02:34
 5
The issue in this case was concealment.  And
12:02:37
 6
today, every one of the documents, every single one of the
12:02:41
 7
documents that the plaintiffs say were concealed are
12:02:44
 8
publicly available.  That's why they have them.  They're on
12:02:47
 9
a website that any American, anyone with the Internet can
12:02:50
get.  They are publicly held in a depository.  Those
12:02:54
documents are not concealed.
12:02:56
And no matter how much money you give
12:02:59
Mrs. Burkhart, it won't make them change what's already
12:03:04
been changed.  The documents are not concealed.
12:03:06
They have been publicly disclosed for more than
12:03:09
ten years.  You can't punish to change a behavior that
12:03:12
already changed long ago.
12:03:13
Now, everyone agrees that there's no way the
12:03:21
tobacco companies can make the cigarette safe.  And you
12:03:25
heard the last witness say the FDA prohibits any change to
12:03:28
cigarettes unless they approve.  So this idea that the
12:03:32
defendants have not done enough at this point, it's simply
12:03:36
not true.  You've heard that the FDA would prohibit any
12:03:39
change in the design of cigarettes unless they expressly
12:03:42
approve.
   168
12:03:44
 1
We know what the companies have done.  We know
12:03:46
 2
that Reynolds, for example, is selling a wide variety of
12:03:50
 3
products that don't involve inhaling smoke.  And you heard
12:03:54
 4
Dr. Borgerding talk about the fact that they eliminate or
12:03:56
 5
greatly reduce those risks.
12:03:59
 6
Reynolds and some of the other companies urge
12:04:01
 7
their customers who want to quit smoking to quit.  Reynolds
12:04:07
 8
and some of the other companies put alternate risk
12:04:10
 9
production out.  How could anyone say the companies haven't
12:04:13
changed?  The advertising on TV and radio and in magazines
12:04:17
and in newspapers is gone.
12:04:19
The warning that they say should have been given
12:04:21
is on every single pack today.  There's no more print
12:04:25
advertisements.  There's no more print advertisements of
12:04:28
the type that they've criticized.  There's no conspiracy or
12:04:31
agreement.  CTR and TI are gone.  The companies publicly,
12:04:37
publicly agree with the Surgeon General's position that
12:04:39
smoking causes these diseases.
12:04:41
It's the exact opposite of what they said existed
12:04:45
and what you found.  How could anyone say the companies
12:04:49
haven't changed?
12:04:50
Now, awarding Mrs. Burkhart $1 or $1 million won't
12:04:56
make the documents that were concealed be disclosed.  They
12:04:59
are already disclosed.
12:05:00
Awarding her $1 or $1 million won't make the
   169
12:05:04
 1
companies admit that smoking causes disease.  They already
12:05:07
 2
do.  And they already tell their customers that.
12:05:10
 3
And whether you award Mrs. Burkhart $1 or
12:05:14
 4
$1 million, it won't change the fact that the companies are
12:05:17
 5
now a fully regulated utility.
12:05:20
 6
What happened in the past and whatever you found
12:05:24
 7
in your verdict is impossible to occur in the future.
12:05:28
 8
Impossible.
12:05:30
 9
The FDA controls the design of cigarettes, what
12:05:33
they say, how they make it.  The companies have paid
12:05:37
billions of dollars to the states to settle the same types
12:05:40
of disputes.  The issues that you found cannot be repeated.
12:05:47
And so what Mr. Heimann calls safeguarding or
12:05:51
punishment is simply giving Mrs. Burkhart more money.  He
12:05:54
wants to give her five times as much as you've already
12:05:57
found to be the full compensation to the penny of her
12:06:01
injuries.
12:06:08
Now, this slide says Reynolds, but obviously it
12:06:11
applies equally to all of the defendants.  The key in this
12:06:16
case was concealment.  And what was concealed was revealed
12:06:20
in 1998 and 1999.  And every single document was disclosed
12:06:24
around 1998 or 1999.
12:06:27
And every single issue, whether it was addiction
12:06:28
or causing COPD that they say should have been disclosed,
12:06:31
has been disclosed by the companies since that time.
   170
12:06:34
 1
Whether you call it punishment or deterrence, it will not
12:06:37
 2
change the behavior because it's already changed.
12:06:41
 3
Judge Jones told you that capitalism isn't on
12:06:46
 4
trial.  Advertising isn't on trial.  Well, advertising is
12:06:49
 5
basically gone.  We know that.  Capitalism still exists.
12:06:53
 6
And under today's market, the government controls
12:06:57
 7
this cigarette from the beginning, how they make it, until
12:07:00
 8
the end.  And the companies have paid billions of dollars
12:07:03
 9
to society for it.
12:07:04
And you have awarded every penny that you have
12:07:07
determined is full, just, and reasonable.  You have fully
12:07:13
compensated Mrs. Burkhart.
12:07:19
And so what I'd ask you to think about in this
12:07:21
case is at the end of the day, after thinking of all of the
12:07:24
evidence, and thinking the full and reasonable compensation
12:07:28
you've ever given, that you've already given, is whether or
12:07:31
not punitive damages can change behavior that's already
12:07:34
changed.
12:07:37
Now, Mr. Heimann didn't outline any evidence.  He
12:07:39
didn't outline any connection between giving Mrs. Burkhart
12:07:43
additional money and a change that he say hasn't already
12:07:47
occurred.
12:07:48
The FDA would shut the companies down if they did
12:07:52
anything that violated the regulation.  They don't exist on
12:07:56
their own anymore.
   171
12:07:57
 1
And so in the end, what he calls punishment would
12:08:02
 2
be a punishment without a purpose.  Now, we punish our kids
12:08:08
 3
when they misbehave.  And when they change their behavior,
12:08:13
 4
we approve.
12:08:14
 5
In this case, to give Mrs. Burkhart, to make her
12:08:17
 6
even wealthier under the guise of punishment would be a
12:08:20
 7
punishment without a purpose.
12:08:21
 8
And to the extent they're talking about deterring
12:08:24
 9
others where it's the other tobacco companies that aren't
12:08:27
in this lawsuit or other companies, the message that would
12:08:30
be sent here today is even if you reveal all of your
12:08:32
information, you put it on the website, you admit your
12:08:35
product is deadly, you admit your product is addictive, you
12:08:39
pull the advertising off the air waves, you shut down the
12:08:42
organizations, you replace all of the wrongdoers with new
12:08:46
people, and you live up to the law of the FDA regulation
12:08:48
that controls this product from beginning to end, their
12:08:53
message is, you still will get punished over and over and
12:08:57
over again, whether it's the 5,000 lawsuits that we've
12:09:00
heard about today or the 6,000 lawsuits that Judge Jones
12:09:04
told you about.
12:09:05
Ladies and gentlemen, $5 million is an enormous
12:09:11
amount of money.  And, of course, you decided that that was
12:09:13
warranted because her injuries were so substantial.  Making
12:09:17
her wealthier and offering and awarding --
   172
12:09:20
 1
MR. HEIMANN:  Your Honor, I object to this
12:09:22
 2
continuous --
12:09:22
 3
THE COURT:  To the last phrase, I'll sustain the
12:09:24
 4
objection.
12:09:25
 5
MR. BELASIC:  In this case, awarding additional
12:09:26
 6
punitive damages would not serve that purpose.  But if you
12:09:30
 7
decide as, of course, you're free to do -- and you will use
12:09:33
 8
your best judgment -- if you decide that any punitive
12:09:38
 9
damages should be awarded, what we suggest, given the
12:09:41
substantial size of the award, $5 million, that you should
12:09:45
award no more than $500,000.
12:09:48
The facts here do not warrant an additional claim
12:09:51
on top of $5 million.  But if you do, it should be no more
12:09:55
than $500,000.
12:09:56
I know it's been a long trial.  I appreciate you
12:09:59
for putting up with me and the trial in general.  Thanks a
12:10:03
lot.


CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE 
12:10:26
MS. GALLAGHER:  Good afternoon, ladies and
12:10:26
gentlemen.  What you heard about in the first part of this
12:10:32
trial was the Philip Morris of old.  In phase one, you
12:10:36
heard about the bad conduct, the documents that I told you
12:10:40
at the beginning of this trial I would not stand up and try
12:10:43
to defend.  I told you you would see stupid things.
   173
12:10:47
 1
What you've heard today, though, is the new Philip
12:10:51
 2
Morris under new management, with new people, going in a
12:10:54
 3
new direction, and have been going in that new direction
12:10:58
 4
for 14 years now.
12:11:01
 5
If you went up to Richmond, Virginia, and you said
12:11:04
 6
I want to talk to that Cullman guy, there's some things he
12:11:07
 7
said I want to talk to him about, they would say, he's not
12:11:10
 8
here, and he hasn't been here in a long, long time.
12:11:14
 9
But you'd meet people like Dr. Lipowicz, who has
12:11:19
spent his career at Philip Morris trying to find a way to
12:11:21
make cigarettes safer.
12:11:25
And you heard from Dr. Lipowicz today about the
12:11:28
restrictions that are now on the tobacco companies that
12:11:32
didn't exist back in the '50s, '60s, and '70s, and
12:11:36
'80s, that you heard about in phase one.
12:11:39
The master settlement agreement prohibits
12:11:43
advertising.  It places restrictions on the tobacco
12:11:46
companies on how they do their business.  And the AGs of
12:11:50
the 50 states can enforce any violation by any tobacco
12:11:55
company for not sticking to every single thing they agreed
12:11:59
to in 1998.
12:12:00
You've got the FDA, you've got 500 people whose
12:12:08
job now is to regulate tobacco, and that is what they're
12:12:11
doing.  Philip Morris supported that legislation and has
12:12:14
done everything the FDA has asked them to do.
   174
12:12:19
 1
Now, I tried to think of what concerns you in the
12:12:26
 2
evidence that you heard over the last week and a half.
12:12:29
 3
Because Philip Morris understands that you were concerned
12:12:32
 4
and they have heard you.  So I tried to think about the
12:12:38
 5
evidence you heard in kind of buckets.
12:12:40
 6
And so, for example, one of the things you heard
12:12:41
 7
about were advertisements.  There were a lot of ads in this
12:12:44
 8
case.  And if that is your concern, you know that can't
12:12:47
 9
happen anymore.
12:12:49
Since 1971, ads have been off TV and radio.  But
12:12:53
since 1998, they've been off billboards.  There's no arena
12:12:58
advertising.  There's no concert sponsorship.  You won't
12:13:05
see a Marlboro hat, Marlboro jacket.  All of that is gone.
12:13:10
So if it was advertising that concerned you, that just
12:13:15
can't happen anymore.
12:13:18
If it was additives or ingredients, you've heard
12:13:21
that the FDA has complete authority over everything that
12:13:23
goes into a cigarette.  If the FDA wants, they can say,
12:13:27
you, Philip Morris, take that additive out.  You, Reynolds,
12:13:30
take that ingredient out.  They have that authority.  They
12:13:35
are the ones who now control the additives and ingredients
12:13:39
in all cigarettes.
12:13:40
So if that was your concern, the FDA, its 500
12:13:45
people, now have authority over that.
12:13:49
If it was nicotine levels, you go back to the FDA.
   175
12:13:54
 1
The FDA, if it wanted to tomorrow could tell the tobacco
12:13:57
 2
companies, from now on, your nicotine levels can't be any
12:14:00
 3
higher than X.
12:14:02
 4
They can tell them to take nicotine out of their
12:14:05
 5
cigarettes.  That is within the purview of the FDA.
12:14:11
 6
MR. HEIMANN:  Your Honor, there's no evidence to
12:14:11
 7
support this, these statements now.
12:14:15
 8
THE COURT:  I'll overrule it.
12:14:16
 9
But I simply give a caution to the jury, we have
12:14:19
had no evidence on the extent of FDA regulation.  We don't
12:14:26
know what the regulation is or what it currently says.  We
12:14:29
do know the categories.  So with that caution, I overrule
12:14:33
the objection.
12:14:37
The point, however, is valid that the FDA does
12:14:39
currently regulate.
12:14:41
MS. GALLAGHER:  The FDA does regulate, and in the
12:14:43
2012 Surgeon General's report you can see what they do.
12:14:46
And Dr. Lipowicz told you -- he works with these
12:14:50
regulators -- that they do control and can dictate to the
12:14:52
tobacco companies nicotine levels.
12:14:54
So if that was your concern, the FDA now has
12:14:57
control over that.
12:15:00
If it were filters, you heard from Dr. Lipowicz,
12:15:04
the FDA has complete regulation over the design of
12:15:06
cigarettes.  The FDA --
   176
12:15:08
 1
MR. HEIMANN:  I'm sorry.  I have to object again,
12:15:09
 2
Your Honor.  We did an abbreviated presentation here.  We
12:15:16
 3
didn't bring in a witness to talk about this.  What she is
12:15:18
 4
saying is not by the evidence.
12:15:20
 5
THE COURT:  I will sustain that last objection,
12:15:22
 6
ma'am.
12:15:27
 7
MS. GALLAGHER:  You heard Dr. Lipowicz talk about
12:15:29
 8
the FDA's control over everything that goes into a
12:15:32
 9
cigarette and everything that comes out of a cigarette.
12:15:34
If you were worried about the internal company
12:15:37
documents, you now know the world can see them.  If you
12:15:41
wanted to go look at any internal document, you could.  So
12:15:43
if that were your concern, that the documents weren't out
12:15:46
there, that can't happen now.  They are already out there.
12:15:49
Awarding punitive damages won't have any effect on
12:15:52
that.
12:15:52
If it was the public statements that concerns you,
12:15:57
you know that now Philip Morris and the other tobacco
12:16:00
companies on their websites say, smoking is addictive.
12:16:05
Smoking can kill you.  Smoking can cause disease.
12:16:08
And even when scientists like Mr. Lipowicz
12:16:11
disagree with something the Surgeon General says about
12:16:14
cigarettes, Philip Morris still tells the public, rely on
12:16:19
the Surgeon General.  That's where you should get your
12:16:22
health information.
   177
12:16:23
 1
So if you were concerned about the misstatements
12:16:25
 2
made by the tobacco companies in the past, you know what
12:16:30
 3
they are doing now and what they have done for the last 
12:16:32
 4
14 years is to say that cigarettes are addictive and
12:16:36
 5
cigarettes can kill you.
12:16:38
 6
If what concerns you were the designations of low
12:16:47
 7
tar or light cigarettes, you know that that can't happen
12:16:51
 8
anymore.  Dr. Lipowicz told you that since 2009 those
12:16:56
 9
descriptors are off cigarettes.
12:16:58
So if that's what concerns you, that has already
12:17:02
been fixed.
12:17:03
It is now 2014.  And the conduct that you found
12:17:07
wrongful cannot be repeated.  The FDA, the attorneys
12:17:16
general have taken care of that.  There is no turning back
12:17:22
from where the tobacco companies have been.
12:17:26
Now, one of the things that the judge told you is
12:17:32
whether you should consider mitigating behavior.  And you
12:17:35
may think that Philip Morris was pushed into admitting that
12:17:38
cigarette smoking is dangerous and that it's addictive.
12:17:42
But whatever the reason they got there, they're there.  And
12:17:48
they're not going back to the conduct that you found
12:17:51
wrongful.
12:17:52
And so at this point, ladies and gentlemen, there
12:17:56
is nothing to deter.  The companies have turned a new page
12:18:02
and are not going back.
   178
12:18:03
 1
And at this point punishment without a purpose is
12:18:11
 2
just that.  There is no purpose to punishing current people
12:18:16
 3
for the wrongdoing of others decades ago.  Because
12:18:21
 4
punishment without purpose is not justice, it's not a
12:18:25
 5
deterrent, it's just revenge.
12:18:28
 6
The Philip Morris of today is not the Philip
12:18:33
 7
Morris that you heard about in the first part of this
12:18:36
 8
trial.
12:18:37
 9
We thank you for your service, and thank you for
12:18:40
your attention over the last two weeks.

CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE 
12:18:58
MR. ROWLEY:  Good afternoon, everybody.  I will be
12:19:04
very brief this afternoon.
12:19:06
Lorillard respects your verdict and appreciates
12:19:07
the time and effort that you put into this trial.  You've
12:19:11
taken the case very seriously, and we appreciate your
12:19:14
service.
12:19:15
If you decide to assess punitive damages in this
12:19:20
case, they can be assessed only with respect to
12:19:26
Mrs. Burkhart.
12:19:28
As Judge Jones told you during the trial, there
12:19:33
have been thousands of lawsuits of this type that have been
12:19:35
brought here in Florida by other smokers and their
   179
12:19:38
 1
families.  They're all entitled to bring and prove up their
12:19:45
 2
own cases and seek damages.  Other juries will hear those
12:19:49
 3
cases.
12:19:51
 4
Judge Jones has instructed you that the law
12:19:54
 5
permits you to punish Lorillard and the other defendants,
12:19:57
 6
if you decide to do so, only as a result of harm
12:20:02
 7
specifically to Mrs. Burkhart.
12:20:07
 8
Lorillard is the subject -- is subject to all of
12:20:09
 9
the FDA regulations that Miss Gallagher told you about.
12:20:17
Every aspect of the manufacture, advertising, and sale of
12:20:20
cigarettes is now very closely regulated.
12:20:23
Under the master settlement agreement that you've
12:20:27
heard about, Lorillard does not advertise on television, on
12:20:32
billboards, or through merchandise.  It doesn't sponsor
12:20:36
sporting events, and had a policy against product placement
12:20:40
that went back more than 40 years.
12:20:42
And Lorillard, too, makes payments to all 
12:20:48
50 states.  Judge Jones gave you an idea of the magnitude
12:20:52
of those payments under the master settlement agreement.
12:20:55
THE COURT:  It has nothing to do with the punitive
12:20:57
damages, of course.
12:20:59
MR. ROWLEY:  Now, common sense tells you that the
12:21:01
people who are working at Lorillard today are not the same
12:21:05
folks who wrote the documents that you saw in this case.
12:21:08
Mr. Heimann and Miss London showed you many of
   180
12:21:16
 1
those documents during the first phase.  They are now all
12:21:20
 2
available to the public.
12:21:22
 3
Dr. Cummings told you that there are 60 million of
12:21:23
 4
those documents.  And when this case is over, you can get
12:21:26
 5
on the Internet and do a Google search and look at all of
12:21:30
 6
those documents.  They are publicly available.
12:21:33
 7
The organizations that they talked to you about,
12:21:37
 8
the TIRC and the CTR and the Tobacco Institute, have not
12:21:43
 9
existed for years.  And there is no similar organization
12:21:47
today.  There is no organization that is anything like
12:21:51
those organizations with respect to the tobacco industry.
12:21:54
For 14 years, Lorillard has acknowledged that
12:21:59
smoking causes COPD and other important diseases and that
12:22:05
smoking is addictive.
12:22:06
Those things are on Lorillard's website, too.  And
12:22:12
when you go to Lorillard's website, there's a link to find
12:22:16
information from the public health community, including
12:22:20
Surgeon General's reports.
12:22:21
Lorillard acknowledges on its website that all
12:22:26
cigarettes are dangerous, that there is no safe cigarette,
12:22:30
and that the only way to avoid the health effects of
12:22:34
smoking is not to smoke.
12:22:39
Lorillard also provides smokers with information
12:22:41
about quitting and where they can get help in quitting
12:22:44
cigarette smoking.
   181
12:22:45
 1
Lorillard, too, has a policy -- and it's on its
12:22:51
 2
website -- to disclose the ingredients in its cigarettes.
12:22:54
 3
You can see all the ingredients that Lorillard puts in its
12:22:57
 4
cigarettes on Lorillard's website.
12:22:59
 5
The most recent company document that you saw
12:23:04
 6
admitted into evidence in phase one of this case was 
12:23:10
 7
34 years old.  It was written 34 years ago.
12:23:14
 8
There's a reason for that.  The conduct that you
12:23:19
 9
heard about in this case stopped years ago.  And it cannot
12:23:25
happen again.
12:23:28
I appreciate your service in this case.  And
12:23:30
Lorillard appreciates it.  Thank you.
12:23:32
THE COURT:  Thank you, Counsel.
12:23:35
Ladies and gentlemen, I won't take your time by
12:23:37
rereading the jury instructions.  They are only a page and
12:23:40
a half.  But I will ask you that as you begin your
12:23:42
deliberations you start by reading the instructions that
12:23:44
govern the law in this section.
12:23:45
I will read to you the last three lines.
12:23:48
You may now retire to the jury room.  You will
12:23:51
have a copy of the verdict form, along with these
12:23:53
instructions.  I simply remind you that anything placed on
12:23:57
each of the three lines must be a unanimous verdict.
12:24:00
When you have reached unanimous agreement, your
12:24:03
foreperson will fill in the verdict forms, date and sign
   182
12:24:06
 1
it, and then return here to the courtroom.
12:24:08
 2
I've already sworn the court security officer who
12:24:13
 3
represents all of the court security officers who will
12:24:17
 4
guard your deliberations.
12:24:18
 5
And, of course, we are providing you lunch.
12:24:20
 6
Hopefully you'll be able to deliberate through the lunch
12:24:22
 7
time as well.
12:24:23
 8
With that, we let you return to the jury room.
12:24:27
 9
Thank you.
