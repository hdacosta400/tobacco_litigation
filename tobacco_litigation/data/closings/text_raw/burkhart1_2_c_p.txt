CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE PLAINTIFF 
11:46:18
 3
MR. HEIMANN:  So His Honor has instructed you on
11:46:20
 4
the questions that guide you or the standards that guide
11:46:24
 5
you in deciding how much to award in punitive damages in
11:46:28
 6
this case.
11:46:28
 7
One of the obvious considerations you have to take
11:46:30
 8
into account is the financial condition of these companies.
11:46:33
 9
And I won't belabor that, but it seems to me fairly obvious
11:46:36
that the financial resources of all three of these
11:46:39
companies are enormous.
11:46:41
And I'm not going to be asking you for a number
11:46:43
that even begins to impinge upon their ability to pay or
11:46:48
will threaten their existence in any way, shape, or form,
11:46:51
although I must say that based on their financial
11:46:54
condition, I would imagine that almost any number that
11:46:59
would be -- could be justified in terms of the amounts of
11:47:04
resources that they have.
11:47:05
But the law limits us and limits you, really, in
11:47:11
how much one can award in punitive damages in today's
11:47:15
circumstances.  And so I'm going to be careful in
11:47:18
suggesting, which I will in a minute, an amount to make
11:47:23
sure that it's within the limitations that the law provides
11:47:26
for us.
11:47:29
But it is important in order for punitive damages
   157
11:47:33
 1
to serve their purpose, that they be in an amount
11:47:36
 2
sufficient to get the attention of the senior people at
11:47:40
 3
these three companies.  Because if it's not enough to get
11:47:44
 4
their attention, then it doesn't serve any purpose at all.
11:47:46
 5
And the purpose, as you know, from what Your Honor
11:47:49
 6
has already told you is, one, to punish for past
11:47:53
 7
misconduct.  That's one purpose.
11:47:54
 8
And the second purpose is to deter these companies
11:47:58
 9
and, quite frankly, other companies in America from
11:48:01
engaging in the kinds of conduct that you have found these
11:48:04
companies engaged in during the years that Mrs. Burkhart
11:48:09
was smoking cigarettes.
11:48:11
You know, they want you to think that the
11:48:17
companies have fundamentally changed.  And that's really
11:48:20
what all of this testimony that you heard about was from.
11:48:23
They want you to believe that somehow they've changed their
11:48:26
stripes and they're not engaged in the kind of conduct now
11:48:30
that they were before.
11:48:32
But the evidence from the Surgeon General shows
11:48:35
you, they're still targeting kids, they're still marketing
11:48:39
to children, and they're still denying the truth about the
11:48:43
addictiveness of cigarettes and the harmfulness of
11:48:46
cigarettes.
11:48:46
And sure, the Surgeon General says, cigarettes
11:48:48
today are deadlier, deadlier than the cigarettes that
   158
11:48:52
 1
Mrs. Burkhart smoked.  And they are deadlier because of the
11:48:55
 2
design, the way they are designed by the cigarette
11:48:58
 3
companies.  That's today.  Today.
11:49:06
 4
I told you when arguing that you should decide to
11:49:09
 5
award punitive damages, that you serve as the conscience of
11:49:13
 6
the community, your community.  And you do.
11:49:18
 7
But now you also serve an additional function.
11:49:20
 8
You're the protector of the community, the protector of the
11:49:24
 9
community, because what you do here in terms of awarding
11:49:28
punitive damages to punish and to deter is for the purpose
11:49:32
of protecting your community from the conduct that you
11:49:36
observed in this courtroom.
11:49:38
MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.  Beyond the
11:49:40
scope of proper punitive argument.
11:49:44
THE COURT:  Overruled.  It relates to deterrence.
11:49:48
MR. HEIMANN:  So, you know, oftentimes we feel
11:49:50
powerless to change things that we see that we know are
11:49:54
wrong.  Happens all the time.
11:49:59
But today, today, you have the power.  You have
11:50:03
the power to change things or to at least attempt to do it
11:50:09
through the power that you have as a jury to award punitive
11:50:13
damages against these companies.  You have the power to
11:50:17
protect your community.
11:50:24
So the amount that you award is entirely up to
11:50:27
you.  I'm going to make a suggestion, and I made a
   159
11:50:32
 1
suggestion as to compensatory damages.  And I saw what you
11:50:35
 2
did to it.  Fair enough.  But here's my suggestion, what I
11:50:39
 3
think makes sense here under the law.
11:50:41
 4
And that -- could I have my slide up?
11:50:46
 5
What I tried to do here was to follow your
11:50:48
 6
determinations about the degree of fault among these
11:50:53
 7
companies.  And so I'm suggesting to you, R.J. Reynolds at
11:50:59
 8
$12.5 million is appropriate; Philip Morris, $7.5 million;
11:51:04
 9
and Lorillard, 5.
11:51:07
And now, you can check my math.  But I think that
11:51:11
what I tried to do was to take the way you had allocated
11:51:14
the comparative fault among the three companies and applied
11:51:18
it to come up with a suggestion as to what numbers I think
11:51:23
you ought to consider.
11:51:24
Now, as I said, it's up to you.  It's really up to
11:51:27
you.  You have to decide what is, in your minds, sufficient
11:51:30
and necessary to address the conduct of these companies in
11:51:34
the past and to deter them in the future, the present and
11:51:38
future from continuing to engage in similar kinds of
11:51:42
conduct.
11:51:42
And I've come well within my 15 minutes, Your
11:51:46
Honor.
