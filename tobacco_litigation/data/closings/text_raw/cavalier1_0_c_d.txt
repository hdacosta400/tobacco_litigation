25           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Counsel.  Good afternoon, members of the jury.
2           I want to add my word of thanks for your
3      commitment, your attention, and your devotion to
4      your job as jurors has been obvious to anybody
5      that's been in the courtroom, and we appreciate
6      that.
7           Let me get right to it, ladies and gentlemen
8      of the jury.
9           Lest there be any doubt, this is a case about
10      Thomas Cavalier.  Now, that sounds rather
11      straightforward, right?  Thomas Cavalier is the
12      deceased in this case.  But what has happened in
13      the weeks that we have been here is that you have
14      seen very little evidence about Thomas Cavalier,
15      and lots of evidence that the plaintiff simply
16      hasn't connected to Mr. Cavalier.  They haven't
17      connected, and frankly, ladies and gentlemen of the
18      jury, there has been very little attempt to even
19      connect a lot of what you just saw, if not all of
20      what you just saw, to Mr. Cavalier himself.  And
21      you have the verdict form in this case.
22           And every single question on the verdict form,
23      every single question asks questions about Thomas
24      Cavalier, not some other smoker, not some other
25      person that may have smoked, but Thomas Cavalier. Every single solitary question on the verdict form.
2           Now, let's talk a little bit about what
3      evidence you have heard in this case.  The
4      plaintiff's case is a red herring.  You've heard
5      what we call generic evidence.  Evidence that
6      anybody can come in and talk about that's not even
7      attempted to be connected to Thomas Cavalier.
8           You've heard about addiction design, somehow
9      that the cigarettes are designed to promote
10      addiction.  Red herring.  Misdirection.
11           Youth marketing.  Now, I'm going to go through
12      this, youth marketing; misdirection.  What have
13      they proved to you youth marketing has to do with
14      Mr. Cavalier?  What evidence?  What facts from that
15      witness stand have they connected to Thomas
16      Cavalier?
17           And then advertising, you've heard testimony
18      about advertising.  Again, ask yourself, and I'm
19      going to go through the analysis, but ask yourself
20      what evidence do we have about Thomas Cavalier and
21      advertising?
22           The plaintiffs have the burden to prove their
23      case to you with facts.  Facts from that witness
24      stand.
25           So what happened in this trial?  Think about it.  We have Dr. Benowitz who testified via
2      videotaped deposition.  Did Dr. Benowitz know
3      anything about Mr. Cavalier?  Nope, not a single
4      fact, didn't even know who he was.
5           What about Dr. Proctor?  At least he came and
6      testified and looked you in the eye.  At least
7      Dr. Proctor, what did he say?  I don't know
8      anything about Mr. Cavalier.  I don't know what he
9      saw.  I don't know what he relied on.  I don't know
10      what he experienced.  What does Dr. Proctor's
11      testimony do to help you decide the issues in the
12      case?  He doesn't even know who Mr. Cavalier was.
13           And then we spent seven hours listening to
14      Mr. Farone -- Dr. Farone, an employee of another
15      cigarette company, Philip Morris.  And we'll talk
16      about that as well.  But ask yourself, what does
17      that testimony have to do, what's the connection,
18      what have the plaintiffs proved to you the
19      connection is between what they talked about and
20      Thomas Cavalier?
21           22 hours in this case, 22 hours of testimony,
22      not just time in the courtroom, but testimony from
23      witnesses who know nothing about Thomas Cavalier,
24      absolutely nothing.  Don't even know that he
25      existed on the planet.  Zero.  Nothing. Let's talk about what we call generic
2      evidence.  Evidence in a box, evidence that you can
3      move from courthouse to courthouse to courthouse
4      and it doesn't matter who the plaintiff is.  It
5      doesn't matter.  But their job, their -- what they
6      have to do is prove by facts what happened to
7      Thomas Cavalier, not what happened to somebody
8      else, not what could have happened to somebody
9      else, but what happened to him.
10           Look.  There is no evidence that Mr. Cavalier
11      started smoking because of advertising, none.
12           There's no evidence, none, zero, that
13      Mr. Cavalier relied on statements by any tobacco
14      company or any tobacco-company related
15      organization.  Think about it.  Is there one shred
16      of evidence, testimony, from that stand, some
17      document, that ties advertising, that ties company
18      statements to Mr. Cavalier?  There is none.
19           And this, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is
20      an important point, because there is no evidence
21      that the dangers and addictiveness of cigarettes
22      were unknown.  And you will have your verdict
23      form -- you will have your jury instructions,
24      you'll have them, and we'll go through them.  But
25      the standard is whether or not it was unknown or unavailable to Mr. Cavalier, that's the standard.
2           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor, that
3      misstates the law.
4           THE COURT:  Sustained.
5           MR. HOHNBAUM:  There is no evidence that the
6      dangers of addictiveness -- that the dangers and
7      addictiveness of cigarettes were unknown or
8      unavailable to Mr. Cavalier.
9           We watched a video of Dr. Farone, hour after
10      hour, talking about the design of cigarettes.  And
11      the fact of the matter is inhalation of tobacco and
12      cigarettes dates back hundreds, hundreds, hundreds
13      of years.
14           R.J. Reynolds did not invent the inhalable
15      cigarette.  Cigarettes were inhaled long before
16      R.J. Reynolds was on the earth.
17           And cigarettes, it's definitional, right?  A
18      cigarette by definition means it's inhalable.
19      That's what it is.
20           Importantly, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
21      cigarettes today, their own witnesses, every single
22      one of them, there are a couple of places where we
23      have unanimity, and this is one of them.
24      Cigarettes today are no more dangerous or addictive
25      than cigarettes from the 1800s.  They want to spend time telling you that somehow the cigarettes, the
2      manufacturing process somehow makes cigarettes more
3      dangerous, more addictive.  But listen to their own
4      witnesses.  Cigarettes today are no more dangerous
5      or addictive than cigarettes from the 1800s, and
6      ask yourself why, why you heard all that testimony
7      about the manufacture and design of cigarettes when
8      the evidence from their own witnesses is that
9      cigarettes are no more dangerous and addictive
10      today than they were hundreds of years ago.
11           Ask yourself, members of the jury, ask
12      yourself.
13           The discussion about additives, the repetitive
14      testimony about additives.  Licorice, you heard
15      licorice.  What does that have to do with this
16      case?  Because their own witnesses acknowledged
17      that additive-free cigarettes take all those
18      additives out, take them out.  They are no less
19      dangerous and addictive than cigarettes with
20      additives.
21           The truth is that cigarettes are dangerous and
22      they're addictive by nature.  By nature, not by
23      design.
24           Dr. Proctor, Dr. Benowitz, Dr. Farone, all
25      agree to that.  That's what they said, from 1933 to 1993, a no less dangerous or addictive conventional
2      cigarette than the one Mr. Cavalier smoked existed.
3      There wasn't a less dangerous cigarette.
4           By nature they are addictive and dangerous,
5      not by design.
6           Follow the evidence.  Follow what you heard
7      from that witness stand from the testimony of
8      witnesses.  Their own witnesses.
9           Youth marketing.  How much time did the
10      plaintiff spend trying to get you angry?
11           MR. ACOSTA:  Your Honor, objection.
12           THE COURT:  Sustained.
13           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Ladies and gentlemen of the
14      jury, anger does not help you do your job.  And
15      we'll talk about that, too.
16           But there is zero evidence, ladies and
17      gentlemen of the jury, zero evidence that
18      Mr. Cavalier started smoking because of
19      advertising.  Did you hear anything from that
20      witness stand -- did you hear anything from that
21      witness stand that said he saw an ad and that's why
22      he smoked?
23           According to their version of events, he
24      couldn't read.  He wasn't opening books or
25      magazines to look at advertising.  But there is zero evidence.  They have failed to come into this
2      courtroom and carry their burden of proof because
3      there is no evidence that any marketing to youth,
4      any advertising, anything like that impacted
5      Mr. Cavalier.  We just saw -- we just saw up there
6      a 1927 document, a 1927 document.  It's in
7      evidence.  Go look at it.  Prep schools and high
8      schools.
9           Now, think about what people knew in 1927, but
10      put that aside and then ask yourself what does that
11      have to do with Thomas Cavalier?  What -- what does
12      it have to do with him?  He wasn't in prep school.
13      He wasn't in high school.  Where is the connection?
14      And then ask yourself why you heard so much about
15      it.  And we'll talk about that.
16           No witness from this witness stand had
17      firsthand knowledge of Mr. Cavalier's smoking
18      before he was 36 years old.
19           Now, look, we're not -- he started smoking
20      before that.  He started smoking -- the evidence
21      would suggest he started smoking sometime in his
22      late teens.  Nobody is running from that fact.
23      That's the fact of the case.  But nobody can tell
24      you about his smoking from firsthand knowledge
25      until he was 36 years old. Folks, you heard all this rhetoric, and all
2      the evidence about youth marketing.  Did you see
3      any evidence that Kool cigarettes were marketed to
4      youth when Mr. Cavalier was growing up?  Any
5      evidence?  Think.  The answer is there wasn't any.
6           We saw candy cigarettes.  Is there any
7      evidence that candy cigarettes had anything to do
8      with Mr. Cavalier?  There's no evidence, zero.
9           What does their own witness, Dr. Benowitz, say
10      about why people start smoking?  What does he say?
11      Does he say it's youth marketing?  Does he say it's
12      something else?  What does he say?  What does their
13      own witness say?
14           Can you play that, Jesse, please?
15           (Videotaped deposition of Dr. Benowitz played
16 as follows:)
17      A.   Well, currently the biggest factor for why
18 children start to smoke is their peers and their social
19 environment.  So if you have a close friend who smokes,
20 or you have a brother or sister who smokes, you are much
21 more likely to smoke than someone who doesn't.
22           (Videotaped deposition of Dr. Benowitz
23 stopped.)
24           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Ladies and gentlemen of the
25      jury, that's what we know.  That's what we know about Mr. Cavalier, is that his dad smoked and his
2      brother smoked.  That's what we know about
3      Mr. Cavalier.
4           You are not permitted, and it will be in
5      there, to speculate or guess.  You have to make
6      your decision based on facts from that witness
7      stand, facts and evidence.
8           This is just a summary of what the witnesses
9      who did come in and say.  Those witnesses did not
10      know when he started smoking, they did not know why
11      he started smoking.  They don't know what his first
12      brand was.  They don't know if it was an R.J.
13      Reynolds brands.  They don't know anything about
14      that.
15           There is simply no proof.  And the plaintiff
16      has that burden of proof.
17           Everything is a red herring, advertising,
18      anything, any witness at all, anybody?  No.  There
19      is no evidence that advertising, there is no
20      evidence that youth market, whatever we talked
21      about with respect to that, there is no evidence
22      that advertising influenced Mr. Cavalier's smoking
23      decision, not just when he started, ladies and
24      gentlemen of the jury, not just when he started,
25      but at any point in his life -- at any point in his life.
2           Plaintiff has the burden to prove facts.
3      They're sticky, and we'll talk about that.  The
4      truth is sticky, and we'll talk about that.
5           Look, Dr. Proctor, Dr. Benowitz, Dr. Farone,
6      22 hours of generic testimony that go to the Engle
7      findings, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
8      Mr. Gary put that up, the Engle findings.  Another
9      jury has already found those, right?  They've
10      already found them.  Mr. Gary told you in opening,
11      365 days.  It's already happened.  Why spend all
12      this time trying to reprove the Engle findings when
13      they are already done.  And the Engle --
14           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor.
15           MR. HOHNBAUM:  -- findings are not --
16           MR. ACOSTA:  That's improper.
17           THE COURT:  Sustained.
18           MR. HOHNBAUM:  The Engle findings are not
19      going to help you make a decision about whether or
20      not Mr. Cavalier is a member of the Engle class,
21      because you can't even consider those.  You can't
22      even consider those findings when you are analyzing
23      whether or not he is a member of the Engle class,
24      and we'll talk about that, too.
25           This isn't going to be the last time I'm going to say it, because the plaintiff has the burden of
2      proof, but there hasn't been evidence about
3      Mr. Cavalier.
4           Take what the plaintiffs say, put it in any
5      courthouse in the country, it isn't going to help
6      you make the decision about Mr. Cavalier.  That's
7      their burden.
8           Here's what we know:  Everything -- everything
9      we knew at the start of the case, when you were
10      sitting there listening to opening statements,
11      right when that started, what did you know at the
12      start of this case about Thomas Cavalier's smoking
13      decisions?  Why he did what he did?  What drove
14      him?  What was in his mind?  What was motivating
15      him?  What did we know at the beginning of the
16      case?  Zero.  And what do we know now?  What do we
17      know now?
18           Did Dr. Farone, did Dr. Proctor, did
19      Dr. Benowitz help you make the decision that you
20      have to make about Thomas Cavalier in this case?
21      No.
22           This is an interesting fact.  The number of
23      family members who believed Mr. Cavalier died of
24      coronary artery disease before trial, they came in
25      here and they're telling you that coronary artery disease caused Mr. Cavalier's death.
2           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor.
3           MR. CHESTNUT:  That misstates the evidence.
4      It is a cause.
5           THE COURT:  Sustained.
6           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Fair enough.
7           I'll be very precise about this, because we'll
8      go through -- we'll go through the instructions.
9      We'll pull them out, and we'll go through it.
10           How many of the family members believe that
11      coronary artery disease was even in the picture
12      before trial?  Zero.
13           This is what his daughters believe.  They
14      believe he died from lung cancer.  That was their
15      testimony.  That was what they believed, was that
16      he died of lung cancer.
17           You didn't hear anybody from that witness
18      stand, any of his daughters testify that they
19      thought coronary artery disease caused his death.
20           Now, look.  You've heard this now a couple
21      times.  The Court has already determined that the
22      plaintiff cannot recover money damages for lung
23      cancer or COPD.  That's the law in this case.
24      That's the law.  We're going to talk about that and
25      the challenges that that law presents to you as jurors.
2           The age when any witness in this case of
3      Mr. Cavalier saw him smoking, he was 36 years old.
4      36.  That's not to say he wasn't smoking before
5      then.  We're not saying he wasn't.  Of course he
6      was.  But what do we know about that?  What do we
7      know about that?
8           Here's the age when anybody says he was
9      smoking an R.J.R. brand of cigarettes:  38.
10           No one knows before 1961, or at least nobody
11      testified as to why he smoked what he smoked, the
12      brands he smoked, before 1961.
13           Now, here's -- you've got to pay attention,
14      and you have been.  We've been watching.  You're
15      paying attention.  But listen to me.  How many
16      witnesses told you Mr. Cavalier said, not that
17      he -- somebody said, oh, he looked like he wanted
18      to quit; my dad wanted to quit; he wanted to quit.
19           How many witnesses said Mr. Cavalier told them
20      he wanted to quit or he was motivated to quit?
21           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor.
22           The Court:  Sustained.
23           MR. HOHNBAUM:  How many witnesses on that
24      witness stand said that Mr. Cavalier told them he
25      wanted to quit and was motivated -- ACOSTA:  Same objection.
2           The Court:  Just slightly rephrase it,
3      Mr. Hohnbaum.
4           MR. HOHNBAUM:  I'll move on.  The point is
5      made.
6           How many witnesses said Mr. Cavalier relied on
7      any statement or omission from R.J. Reynolds or the
8      tobacco industry?
9           Think about it.  Did anybody from the witness
10      stand say he relied on something he was told or not
11      told?  Anybody?  Any fact, any fact?
12           The answer is nobody.
13           Think about this, ladies and gentlemen of the
14      jury.  If you spend your whole life doing something
15      every day, smoking five packs of cigarettes a day,
16      and somebody tells you that you have a disease,
17      lung cancer that's caused by smoking, you lived
18      your whole life thinking this isn't bad, it's not
19      going to hurt me, and some doctor comes in and he
20      told you smoking has caused cancer, what would you
21      expect to see?
22           You would expect to see, I don't know, the
23      tobacco companies didn't tell me, the tobacco
24      companies hid things from me, I didn't know this.
25           Diagnosed in 1989, passed away in 1993. Nothing, nothing about that, absolutely nothing.
2           You have the photographs.  You have the
3      photographs.  Go look at the photographs.  We
4      showed you some photographs.  How many
5      photographs -- of all of the photographs that they
6      showed you and all of the photographs that are in
7      evidence, how many of them show Mr. Cavalier
8      smoking R.J. Reynolds cigarettes?  Zero.
9           Kool, that's the brand manufactured by R.J.
10      Reynolds cigarettes.  Marlboro, other testimony
11      that he smoked Marlboro, manufactured by Philip
12      Morris.  Parliament cigarettes, manufactured by
13      Philip Morris.
14           No photos -- how many photos have we seen?
15      How many photos have we seen of him smoking
16      cigarettes?  Every photo they put up, almost every
17      photo had him with a cigarette in his hand.
18           How many R.J. Reynolds cigarettes?  None.
19           These are some of the photos.  You've seen
20      these.  You go look.  None.
21           The plaintiff has the burden to prove her case
22      with evidence.  What does not prove the case is
23      rhetoric.  Argument doesn't prove the case.
24      Assumptions, speculation, what may have happened,
25      what could have happened, what might have happened, that's not evidence.
2           And generic allegations, allegations that
3      could be put anywhere don't help the plaintiff
4      sustain her burden to prove her case.
5           I don't know, we've heard -- and we're going
6      to talk about this, but remember how this evidence
7      came in.  We're going to talk about Dr. Cowen,
8      we're going to talk about Ms. Cavalier and
9      Mr. Possidento.
10           Who played their depositions in this case?
11      The plaintiff put those depositions in evidence.
12           If it wasn't credible, if it wasn't
13      believable, why would the plaintiff put them in the
14      case?  Why would they read their depositions?
15           I want to also make one thing clear, members
16      of the jury, because you're going to see -- and
17      you've heard some argument about this point.  Let's
18      make this point very clear at the outset.
19           These are all the warnings that appeared on
20      packs of cigarettes starting in 1966.  The
21      plaintiff admits -- it's not disputed, we're not
22      fighting over it, we're not fussing over it, we're
23      not guessing at it.
24           We know that the plaintiff admits that the
25      warnings were adequate, adequate as a matter of law.  And the plaintiff, a stipulation, folks,
2      agreed to, does not dispute their adequacy.
3           These warnings starting in 1966, they were
4      adequate.  They've already stipulated to that.  Why
5      all the rhetoric, why all the arguments, why
6      everything else are they telling you about this,
7      what was said, what wasn't said, what could have
8      been said, what might have been said, and sometimes
9      what should have been said?
10           Because they admit that the warnings were
11      adequate, and they don't dispute that they were
12      adequate.
13           I showed you this slide at the beginning of
14      the case.  It's what I ended my opening statement
15      on, was what are the facts that are actually going
16      to help you make the decision in this case?  What
17      are the facts?
18           Number 1, Mr. Cavalier did not die from
19      coronary artery disease caused by smoking.  We'll
20      go through that.
21           We talk about this:  There is no evidence that
22      he smoked R.J. Reynolds cigarettes before 1961 when
23      he was 38 years old.
24           We also know that he continued to smoke for
25      decades despite repeated specific warnings, including those on the pack of cigarettes, about
2      the dangers, starting before we even know he smoked
3      an R.J.R. brand -- R.J.R. cigarette.
4           Look, we have unanimity on this as well, and
5      we'll talk about this.  Mr. Cavalier always had the
6      ability to quit, always.  Their witnesses, their
7      expert witnesses, every single one of them:
8      Everybody, every single person has the ability to
9      quit.
10           And the fact of the matter, until he decided
11      in 1989, he wasn't motivated to quit.  When he was
12      motivated, he quit.  If he was motivated in the
13      '50s, '60s, '70s, he would have quit, too.  Why
14      would we think anything else?  Why would we guess
15      about anything else?  He quit.  He can quit.
16           And finally, Mr. Cavalier's smoking decisions
17      were not influenced by anything R.J. Reynolds said
18      or did.
19           Now, I'm going to cover some of these topics;
20      and then Mr. Persons is going to finish and deal
21      with some of the other ones.
22           The plaintiff failed to prove Mr. Cavalier as
23      a class member.  I'm going to handle that part of
24      the argument.
25           Failed to prove Mr. Cavalier died because information about the dangers and addictiveness of
2      smoking were unknown or unavailable.
3           And failed to prove that Mrs. Fanali, on
4      behalf of the estate of Thomas Cavalier, is
5      entitled to recover money damages on behalf of her
6      mother, Ann Cavalier, when she, herself, admits
7      that it was her father's own decision, her words,
8      own decision to quit or not to quit.
9           All right.  Look familiar?  Hopefully it does.
10      This is what we showed you in opening statement.
11           For class membership, for the first two
12      questions on the verdict form, the plaintiff has to
13      clear three hurdles.
14           First, they must prove that Mr. Cavalier died
15      from coronary artery disease and that that coronary
16      artery disease was caused by smoking.
17           Second:  If they clear that hurdle, they have
18      to establish that Mr. Cavalier was addicted to
19      nicotine.  I'll talk about that.
20           And if they clear those two hurdles, they also
21      have to prove that addiction to R.J. Reynolds
22      cigarettes was a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's
23      death.
24           And "legal cause," it's in your instruction
25      booklet.  We'll talk about what "legal cause" means, was a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's death.
2           So here's the first question on the verdict
3      form:  "Was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of
4      Mr. Cavalier's coronary artery disease..."
5           So there are two parts to this right, right?
6      That's the first part, "Was smoking cigarettes a
7      legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's coronary artery
8      disease and...was coronary artery disease a legal
9      cause of his death?"
10           That's the medical causation component.  Two
11      components, right?
12           Did it cause, was it a legal cause of the
13      coronary artery disease; and if so, did the
14      coronary artery disease, was it a legal cause of
15      his death.
16           Now, look, we talked about this before; and it
17      makes your job challenging, even more difficult
18      than otherwise, because the Judge has already
19      instructed you that the plaintiff cannot recover
20      money damages for lung cancer or COPD and you're
21      sitting there and you know, even according to their
22      theory, that COPD was a cause of death.
23           And this is where this instruction is so
24      critical.  Does anger help you make your decision
25      in this case?  Does sympathy help you make your decision in this case?
2           Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is
3      following the law.  Taking the facts as you find
4      them and following the law, that's justice in this
5      country.
6           I agree with Mr. Gary, Lady Justice is blind.
7      It's not a popularity contest.  It's not have you
8      done bad things.  That's not justice.  Justice is
9      looking at the facts, deciding what you've heard
10      from that witness stand, what the truth is.  And
11      then it's about you've got it, justice is following
12      the law, plain and simple.
13           That's the way it is in America.  We don't let
14      prejudice, we don't let sympathy, we don't let bias
15      decide things in a court of law.  We don't let
16      anger decide things in a court of law.  We let the
17      facts decide, and we let following the law decide.
18      That's justice in the United States of America; and
19      everybody, everybody is entitled to that justice.
20           All right.  Five times, five sustained
21      objections, talking about what --
22           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor.
23           THE COURT:  Sustained.
24           MR. GARY:  And move to have it stricken.
25           THE COURT:  Sustained. GARY:  Thank you.
2           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Let's look -- you have this in
3      your instructions.  It's not complicated.  It's not
4      a complicated concept.
5           On the first question of whether smoking was a
6      legal cause of coronary artery disease, it's a
7      legal cause "if it directly and in natural and
8      continuous sequence produced or contributed
9      substantially to producing such coronary artery
10      disease --" here's the point -- "so that it can be
11      said that, but for smoking cigarettes, the coronary
12      artery disease would not have occurred."
13           Then, lest we miss the point, the jury
14      instruction looks at it just from the other side of
15      the coin, right?
16           MR. ACOSTA:  I have an objection to this
17      slide.  It's not the whole jury instruction.
18           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Neither did they put up --
19           THE COURT:  That's fine.  It's overruled.
20           MR. HOHNBAUM:  In other words, the plaintiff
21      must prove that, but for Mr. Cavalier's cigarette
22      smoking, he would not have developed coronary
23      artery disease.
24           If he developed it from something else,
25      regardless of his smoking, then they have failed to prove to you that smoking was the cause as opposed
2      to something else.
3           Now, look, I've been here a long time.  At the
4      end of the day, quite simply, ladies and gentlemen
5      of the jury, this fact, and this fact alone, is
6      determinative of this case, because what we know is
7      that during Mr. Cavalier's life, diabetes, diabetes
8      caused coronary artery disease.  It caused it 100
9      percent of the time.  Put smoking on the moon, put
10      it on some other planet.  Assume he never smoked
11      any cigarette in his life, not one.  The fact of
12      the matter is Mr. Cavalier was going to get
13      diabetes -- was going to get coronary artery
14      disease because he had diabetes.  It wasn't caused
15      by smoking.  It has to be but for, but for the
16      smoking, he wouldn't have got it.  He got it and
17      was going to get it from diabetes alone.
18           Did anybody challenge that proposition?
19      Dr. Feingold looked at that.  Nobody.  Diabetes
20      caused the coronary artery disease, and it caused
21      damage.  Smoking could not be the "but for" cause,
22      because even if he didn't smoke, he was going to
23      get it.
24           Look, this is -- at this point in time, you
25      have got this, I know you have it.  He had diabetes since 1974.  You know that.  Nobody is fussing
2      about that, no one is disputing that, no one is
3      jumping up and down and saying, "That ain't true."
4      It's the truth.  He was on it since 1974 and he had
5      problems controlling it.  1974, had diabetes.
6           We know that diabetes ran in Mr. Cavalier's
7      family.  His mother, you remember that, his mother
8      died from complications of diabetes in 1968.  His
9      daughter has diabetes.  Neither one of them are
10      smokers.
11           Dr. Cowen, I'm going to talk a lot about him.
12      So another way of saying that is even if he never
13      smoked, he may very well have had coronary artery
14      disease anyway, correct?  Yes.
15           The diabetes alone, whether he smoked a
16      cigarette or not, is that a significant enough risk
17      factor to have caused the coronary artery disease?
18      And the answer to that question is yes.  Dr. Cowen
19      agrees.  Dr. Cowen agrees with Dr. Wohlgelernter,
20      who says at that time, when he was alive -- things
21      have improved, but when he was alive, diabetes
22      equalled coronary artery disease.  That's how it
23      worked.
24           Dr. Feingold, we'll talk a little bit about
25      him.  Diabetes, the most important risk factor in the development of coronary artery disease?  Yes,
2      he says.
3           And then, of course, we've got
4      Dr. Wohlgelernter.
5           "In your patients who have diabetes in the
6      '70s, '80s, and early '90s, what percentage of
7      those patients who had diabetes also had coronary
8      artery disease?"
9           And what does he say?  What does he say?  What
10      percentage?  Every single one of them, every single
11      one of them, and that's because it's established at
12      that point in time, scientific fact, that diabetes
13      causes coronary artery disease 100 percent of the
14      time.
15           How can they meet their burden of proving to
16      you that but for smoking, he wouldn't have coronary
17      artery disease?  Of course, he would have had
18      coronary artery disease.  He had it because of the
19      diabetes.  They can't meet even the first threshold
20      question of whether or not smoking was a legal
21      cause of the coronary artery disease because, of
22      course, it wasn't.  He was going to have diabetes,
23      no matter what.
24           Let's just be very clear about this.  The long
25      list of Engle diseases that you heard, I think it's in your jury instructions, is diabetes on that
2      list?  Of course, it's not.  It's not an Engle
3      disease.  And nobody told you from that witness
4      stand, and that's because they can't tell you from
5      that witness stand, that diabetes is caused by
6      smoking.  That's because it's not.  It's not caused
7      by smoking.
8           Diabetes caused Mr. Cavalier's coronary artery
9      disease.
10           But, look, he had other risk factors.  Right?
11      I mean, this is -- you have this.  He had family
12      history, Tolinase, gender, age, and lack of
13      physical activity.  Once again, there is unanimity,
14      everyone agrees that those are risk factors for
15      coronary artery disease.
16           Let's talk about family history.  Father had a
17      heart attack, positive family history.  Father died
18      at 83 of coronary artery disease.  Those are notes,
19      ladies and gentlemen of the jury, from
20      cardiologists.
21           Why are they asking this question of him?  Why
22      is it important to them?  What does "positive"
23      mean?  It means that Mr. Cavalier had a family
24      history of heart disease, and that's a significant
25      risk factor for developing that disease. Dr. Wohlgelernter, after five years, and we
2      know that he developed coronary artery disease,
3      according to the evidence, sometime in 1990, right,
4      1990?  He had diabetes since 1974.  Is that over
5      five years?  Yes, it's well over five years.  100
6      percent of the people.
7           Let's go to the Elmo, Jesse.
8           Is this the button I'm supposed to push?
9           All right.  So you will have the verdict form,
10      right?
11           Boy, that's slow.  This late in the day, we'll
12      have to switch this up.  Let me just do this.  All
13      right.  Verdict form, the first question, right,
14      has two parts to it:  Was smoking cigarettes a
15      legal cause of Thomas Cavalier's coronary artery
16      disease?  That's the first prong of that.  Was it a
17      legal cause, and it's not a legal cause if you take
18      smoking out of the picture, and he still would have
19      gotten coronary artery disease, and that's the
20      evidence in this case.
21           The plaintiff can't meet her burden to prove
22      the very first -- the very first thing that they
23      are -- have to prove to you.  No, on the verdict
24      form.  First question.
25           Facts, facts, evidence, facts, and following the law.
2           Now, you can go ahead and shut that down,
3      Jesse.
4           Here's what the evidence showed, that
5      Mr. Cavalier died from severe COPD.  Coronary
6      artery disease was not a legal cause of
7      Mr. Cavalier's death.  This isn't complicated.
8           I said in opening, "Where would you go and who
9      would you trust?  Where would you go to determine
10      what caused somebody's death?"
11           You go to the death certificate.  That's where
12      you would go, and I want to just make it very clear
13      to you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the
14      same instruction, the same language you have for
15      whether or not smoking was a legal cause of
16      coronary artery disease is the same one you have
17      with respect to whether or not coronary artery
18      disease caused Mr. Cavalier's death.  They must
19      prove that but for Mr. Cavalier's cigarette
20      smoking, he would not have --
21           Do you have the other one up?
22           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor, that's not
23      the whole thing.
24           THE COURT:  Overruled.
25           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Let's clear the air on that. Can we just clear the air?
2           Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, of course,
3      two things can combine and cause somebody's death.
4      Of course.  Is that novel?  That's not novel.  Of
5      course, two things can cause somebody's death.
6           The fact is they have to prove that coronary
7      artery disease was a legal cause of his death, that
8      if coronary artery disease was not in the picture,
9      if you put it up on the moon, they have to prove he
10      wouldn't die.
11           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor.
12           MR. HOHNBAUM:  That's exactly the standard.
13           THE COURT:  Overruled.
14           MR. HOHNBAUM:  That's exactly the standard.
15           MR. ACOSTA:  Same objection.
16           THE COURT:  Overruled.
17           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Don't get the concurring cause
18      instruction, come up here and tell you there is
19      concurring cause.  Nobody -- the judge isn't going
20      to let them tell you that it's anything that "but
21      for."  "But for" did the coronary artery disease
22      cause his death?  If it wasn't in the picture, he
23      still would have died anyway.
24           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor, same
25      objection. COURT:  Overruled.
2           MR. HOHNBAUM:  All right.  So you pull that
3      instruction out.  Pull it out.  When you get back
4      in the jury room, you pull it out, and you read it.
5      It's not complicated.  It's not difficult to
6      understand.
7           So what does the death certificate say?  We've
8      heard a lot of talk about the death certificate.
9      But what everybody agrees to, what Dr. Feingold
10      agrees to, what Dr. Cowen agrees to, what
11      Dr. Wohlgelernter agrees to, is death certificates
12      are important legal documents.  It is the standard
13      of care.  Every single witness told you it is the
14      standard of care of medical professionals
15      throughout the country to fill out the death
16      certificate accurately and completely.
17           Nobody said anything different.  Nobody said
18      that somehow this is something nobody pays any
19      attention to.  It's the death certificate, ladies
20      and gentlemen of the jury.  And what we know from
21      Dr. Cowen is he knew what the requirements were.
22      He knew it was an important legal document, and we
23      know from Dr. Cowen that he filled it out, and he
24      filled it out accurately.  So let's just recap.
25           Did Mr. Cavalier have extensive and severe COPD?  Did he have extensive COPD?  Nobody is -- he
2      did.  Record after record after record after record
3      show that not only did he have it, but that it was
4      getting worse, and it was getting worse, and it was
5      getting worse, and what happens with somebody who
6      has COPD, what happens is that they start getting
7      infections, and they start getting pneumonia, and
8      they start having fevers, and they have to go to
9      the hospital more frequently.
10           And, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what
11      happened to Mr. Cavalier?  That's what happened to
12      Mr. Cavalier.  That's exactly what happened to him.
13           Let's talk about the final hospitalization,
14      because no one is going to come up here and tell
15      you that he didn't have severe life-threatening
16      COPD.  The last hospitalization, what's he admitted
17      for?  He's admitted for COPD and congestive heart
18      failure.  The only records that we have for the
19      last 10 days -- today that we have for the last 10
20      days of his life are reports, not the films, but
21      reports of portable chest x-rays.
22           What we saw from Dr. Wohlgelernter yesterday
23      is that Mr. Cavalier's heart failure was treated,
24      and it improved.  That's what the evidence shows.
25      And at the same time that the congestive heart failure was improving, the COPD was worsening, and
2      the severe COPD caused his death.
3           Look, maybe you remember Dr. Feingold.
4      Dr. Feingold didn't take you through each of these
5      x-rays, reports of x-rays, that Dr. Wohlgelernter
6      did.  Dr. Wohlgelernter didn't run from the
7      evidence in the case.  He went through it in
8      painstaking detail.  Why would we do that?  Because
9      those records establish that the congestive heart
10      failure was being treated, it was improving, and it
11      didn't cause his death.
12           What do we know about congestive heart
13      failure?  I know that's a lot of medical concepts
14      being thrown at you, but what we know from their
15      own witnesses is that it can get better from day to
16      day, right?  We know that one day you can have an
17      episode of congestive heart failure, and the next
18      day, you can improve and be fine.  The congestive
19      heart failure will have been remedied, and that's
20      not to say you won't have another episode of
21      congestive heart failure, but it's that variable.
22      It can vary day to day, middle of the day to end of
23      the day.  That's what we know.  We don't have to go
24      any farther than their own witness for that.  Now,
25      look, very important piece of information. In May of 1990, we talked about the ejection
2      fraction, and the ejection fraction, as
3      Dr. Wohlgelernter said, is not -- didn't tell you
4      that he had congestive heart failure.  It says that
5      he's got a weakened heart muscle, and sometimes
6      that can lead to congestive heart failure and
7      sometimes it doesn't, right?
8           We know that in May of 1990, although we don't
9      have an echocardiogram, we have a record that
10      refers to it that says he had an ejection fraction
11      of 30 to 35 percent.  Think May 1990.
12           We know from the records that in July of 1993,
13      in the last couple weeks of his life, the last
14      ejection fraction reading we have shows that his
15      ejection fraction was -- what was it?  29 percent.
16      Essentially the same reading as he had three years
17      earlier; yet, they want you to believe that this
18      somehow, this 29 percent, would have caused his
19      death.  Would have caused his death?  He had
20      essentially the same thing three years ago.  Ask
21      yourself whether that makes any sense at all.
22           What do we know from Dr. Feingold?  We know
23      that a person can live with and function with an
24      ejection fraction of 29 percent.  That's what he
25      had.  I asked him the specific question.  I wanted to know what he was going to say.
2           Can somebody live?  We know that's true.  How
3      do we know it's true?  We know it's true because he
4      was living with an ejection fraction of around 29
5      percent three years before, and what was he doing
6      when he had the ejection fraction of 30 to 35
7      percent in 1990, what was he doing?
8           He was taking long trips, deadheading hard
9      trips, on death's door?  Significant enough to
10      cause death?  He was driving, deadheading it up to
11      Connecticut and back.  It makes no sense.
12           You've seen this before.  Reasonable degree of
13      medical certainty, reasonable degree of medical
14      certainty.  Reasonable degree of medical
15      probability.  That's the standard, right?  That's
16      the magic words that the lawyers use and the
17      witnesses say, "Oh, yeah, reasonable degree of
18      medical certainty, that's what I'm testifying to
19      you about."
20           What does Dr. Feingold not have that Dr. Cowen
21      who filled out the death certificate had?  All of
22      these, every single one.  There is no dispute that
23      these documents would have existed at the time.
24      There is no doubt about that.
25           Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you also heard that congestive heart failure is not
2      complicated.  It's not one of those things that you
3      need to get some advanced degree in.  It's like
4      Medical School 101.  And what they want you to
5      believe is that Dr. Cowen, on these records, saw
6      evidence that congestive heart failure caused his
7      death.  They want you to think that he saw all of
8      this, and all of that must have said the congestive
9      heart failure was so bad, so much of a problem,
10      that it caused his death.  But of course, he
11      didn't.
12           It's fair to ask yourself this question:  Why
13      would Dr. Cowen, who had all of this information,
14      why would Dr. Cowen put down that the only cause of
15      his death -- and then he affirmed it just a little
16      while ago, a month or so ago at his deposition --
17      that COPD was the only cause of his death?  And the
18      only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from
19      that is that none of this evidence that he had but
20      that Dr. Feingold doesn't have and we don't have
21      today, that that evidence supported that the only
22      cause of death was COPD.
23           I asked Dr. Wohlgelenter -- last question last
24      night -- did anybody on the planet know more about
25      Mr. Cavalier's medical condition than Dr. Peter Cowen.  Did Dr. Feingold?  Of course not.
2      Dr. Cowen had all the information.
3           We've heard lots of things about Dr. Cowen.
4      Maybe he wasn't paying attention.  Maybe he wasn't
5      taking his job seriously.  What do we know from
6      Dr. Feingold, who reviewed all the records?  What
7      did Dr. Feingold say about Dr. Cowen?  Did he say
8      he looked sloppy.  Did he say he wasn't -- didn't
9      know what was going on?  Did he say he wouldn't
10      have been able to determine whether or not
11      congestive heart failure caused a man's death?
12           Did he say any of those things?  He didn't.
13           What he said, by contrast, was that Dr. Cowen
14      was, in quotation marks, qualified, capable, and
15      competent.  That's Dr. Cowen from Dr. Feingold's
16      perspective.  Not sloppy, not not paying attention,
17      not not doing his job, not being cavalier about
18      filling out a legal document.
19           Dr. Feingold himself, qualified, competent,
20      and capable.
21           All right.  So I don't know, what do you do if
22      you're the plaintiff?  What do you do with that?
23      Well, you try to kick up some dust.  Right?
24           So all the testimony about is that Dr. Cowen's
25      signature?  Well, it doesn't look like signature 15 years later.  Is that really his
2      signature?  Is that really an H and a W.  Is that
3      really all of that?  I don't -- who would we ask?
4      They played his -- they had his deposition.  What
5      did Dr. Cowen say?  Dr. Cowen, as recently as two
6      months ago, said, It's my signature.
7           Why have some discussion, why have somebody
8      suggest that somehow it's not his signature?
9      That's the very definition of a red herring.  The
10      man, under oath, said it's his signature.
11           THE COURT:  Let me just ask, any jurors need a
12      break?  Everybody okay?  I just wanted to make sure
13      everybody is okay.  Anybody need a break?
14           JURORS:  Yes.
15           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Dr. Cowen, it's not just that,
16      back in 1993, he thought -- it's not just back in
17      1993 that he thought that COPD was the only cause
18      of death.  Because his deposition was read and he's
19      saying, Yes, I certify, by signing this death
20      certificate, that COPD was the only cause of
21      Mr. Cavalier's death, the only cause.
22           And ladies and gentlemen of the jury, think
23      about it:  He treated Mr. Cavalier.  He treated
24      Mrs. Cavalier.  He treated one of the daughters,
25      Jeanne, maybe one of the daughters.  Remember, that was the testimony, He was my doctor and I gave him
2      the letter and all that stuff.
3           He was a family physician.  If he had
4      something to say that would be helpful -- if he had
5      something to say that would be helpful to the
6      plaintiff's case -- you heard in his deposition,
7      Would you go to trial?  I asked him:  "Did they ask
8      you to go to trial?"  He doesn't have anything
9      helpful to say.
10           What he has to say is that COPD was the only
11      cause of death and he stuck with that even after he
12      had been shown medical records prior to his
13      deposition.  And you see in the -- you heard in the
14      reading of his deposition that a lawyer for the
15      plaintiff was there, didn't ask any questions.  He
16      had met with Mr. Cavalier prior to the deposition.
17      Remember that?  30 minutes, 40 minutes, phone call,
18      they actually met, sat down, talked to him.  Had
19      every opportunity to try to figure out whether
20      Dr. Cowen could say something other than "COPD
21      caused his death," and the answer was he couldn't
22      because that's the truth.  COPD is what caused his
23      death.
24           Now, look, think about it.  Dr. Feingold was a
25      pulmonologist, a lung doctor.  That's his training, that's his experience, he's a pulmonologist.  They
2      brought a pulmonologist to talk to you about
3      coronary artery disease.  They brought -- they
4      brought a pulmonologist to talk to you about
5      coronary artery disease, not a cardiologist.  They
6      brought a pulmonologist to talk to you about
7      addiction, not a psychiatrist.
8           Dr. Feingold, $40 million, $40 million
9      testifying.  That's what he does.  That's how he
10      earns his money.  $40 million.  That's who they
11      brought to tell you that something other than COPD
12      caused this man's death.
13           Ladies and gentlemen, there are cardiologists
14      in Florida.  There are cardiologists right down the
15      street.  There are cardiologists that could have
16      come in and testified for the plaintiff.  Instead,
17      they bring in the $40-million-man.
18           Now, look, you know the saying, "A picture is
19      worth a thousand words."  Yeah, I thought I
20      stumbled on that.
21           Look, take a look at that and think about this
22      for a second.  Just think about this slide.  This
23      was Dr. Feingold's own slide.  He prepared it.
24      You've seen it before.  Does anything jump out at
25      you about this slide?  His clinical practice, do you see "cardiology" on there?  It's his own slide.
2           Did you see "addiction" on there, clinical
3      practice?  He's not a cardiologist, ladies and
4      gentlemen of the jury, and he's not a psychiatrist.
5      And according to his own document that he prepared
6      that he probably uses in all kind of cases, what
7      does he say?  Cardiology is not his expertise, and
8      neither is addiction.
9           I think it's also interesting in this
10      particular case, under these particular facts,
11      that -- what is he looking into?  A microscope.  Do
12      we have any pathology in this case?  Do we have any
13      slides to help determine what happened to
14      Mr. Cavalier?  They existed at one point in time,
15      but do we have any now?  No.
16           What's in the background here?  What do you
17      see in the background here?  Actual x-rays, the
18      films.  Not reports of the x-rays, but the films.
19      Do we have any films?  We don't have a single film.
20      You know who had access to pathology?  Dr. Cowen
21      did.
22           Do you know who had access, and undoubtedly
23      saw films, x-ray films?  Dr. Cowen, the doctor who,
24      under oath, said COPD was the only cause of death.
25           Now, to Dr. Feingold's credit, he acknowledged -- as he had to, he would look silly
2      if he did not -- that the fact that there was no
3      discharge summary -- remember, if somebody is in
4      the hospital, they leave the hospital, they pass
5      away, there is a death summary.  There is a
6      discharge summary.
7           The fact that we don't have it, the fact that
8      we don't have it, it limited what he could
9      ultimately decide.  That's his own words and it has
10      to be the case because he's trying to come in here
11      and tell you, within a reasonable degree of medical
12      certainty, what happened to this man when he
13      doesn't have the information necessary to make that
14      determination and Dr. Cowen did.
15           All right.  This is -- so we have -- maybe
16      Dr. Cowen didn't sign the death certificate.  Maybe
17      it's somebody else's signature.  That doesn't work.
18      Right?
19           We have this, the ultimate red herring in the
20      case.  So this is 2008.  This is 15 years after he
21      passes away, and Dr. Cowen is asked by somebody in
22      Mr. Cavalier's family to do a letter for him.
23      There is only one thing you need to know about this
24      letter, and that that's Dr. Cowen acknowledged both
25      that he signed it and that it's wrong.  That's all you need to know.  Right?  He signed it and it's
2      wrong.  He didn't have his records.  The family
3      thought it was lung cancer that caused his death.
4      He filled out the form, the letter, and he moved it
5      along.
6           Did he go and amend the death certificate to
7      say something else?  No.  Why not?  Because he
8      knows, as he said in this case under oath, that
9      COPD was the only cause of death.
10           The only doctor specializing in cardiology,
11      specializing in the disease of coronary artery
12      disease, the only doctor who has devoted his entire
13      practice of medicine to cardiac issues,
14      Dr. Wohlgelenter, told you he didn't die from
15      coronary artery disease.
16           But for -- put coronary artery disease on the
17      moon, and Mr. Cavalier is going to die anyway
18      because he died from COPD.
19           That's the second part of the first question,
20      which we contend you shouldn't get to, just so
21      we're clear.  We have to be thorough, we have to go
22      through everything, but the first question of
23      whether or not Thomas Cavalier -- was smoking a
24      legal cause of Thomas Cavalier's coronary artery
25      disease?  We've already talked about that.  The answer is no because diabetes caused it, does 100
2      percent of the time.
3           But they also have to prove that coronary
4      artery disease was a legal cause of his death.  But
5      for coronary artery disease, he wouldn't have died.
6           MR. ACOSTA:  Objection, Your Honor, that's not
7      right.
8           MR. HOHNBAUM:  That is indeed the standard.
9           THE COURT:  Overruled.
10           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Even if they -- first check
11      mark, second check mark, they do not -- did not
12      meet their burden to prove to you that smoking was
13      a legal cause of coronary artery disease or that
14      coronary artery disease caused his death.  The
15      answer to the first question on the verdict form is
16      no.
17           But as I talked about, we have to go through
18      the rest of the verdict form.  Unfortunately for
19      you at 10 to 6:00, that's what we have to do.  We
20      appreciate you staying with us as we talk to you.
21           Here's the second question on the verdict
22      form:  Was Thomas Cavalier addicted to cigarettes
23      containing nicotine?  And if so, was an addiction
24      to cigarettes manufactured by R.J. Reynolds a legal
25      cause -- legal cause, a but for cause -- of coronary artery disease and death?
2           This is what we talked about.  We showed that
3      before.  That's the hurdle, right, addiction.
4           The DSM-5.  You heard a lot about addiction in
5      this case.  Let me see if I can't straighten some
6      things out.
7           What is the state of the art as it relates to
8      nicotine addiction in this country?  Not stuff from
9      2010, not stuff from 2008.  2015, today, what's the
10      state of the art?
11           The state of the art is the DSM-5.  Studies
12      come out, people get more knowledgeable, more
13      information comes out, things are updated.  The
14      DSM-5 doesn't stay stale.  There were reiterations
15      of the DSM-IV and they came out with the DSM-5.
16      Who came out with it?  The American Psychiatric
17      Association.
18           That document from Dr. Barnett, the DSM-5:
19      Half of all daily smokers are addicted.  Half.
20      Let's just start from there.  We're not saying that
21      people weren't addicted to cigarettes, ladies and
22      gentlemen.  Of course they are.  Of course they
23      are.  But the evidence, the facts, not guess work,
24      not speculation, the facts are that half of daily
25      smokers are not addicted. We know, look, say all you want about
2      Dr. Barnett.  Dr. Barnett agrees with Dr. Benowitz
3      that there are reasons other than nicotine
4      addiction for why people smoke.  Taste, smell,
5      enjoyment, relaxation, ritual.  That's undeniable.
6      Their own expert says it.  We don't have to guess.
7      We're not fussing about that.
8           There are reasons other than nicotine for why
9      people smoke, and that makes perfect sense.
10           I have an app on my phone, it's a calculator.
11      You can get on the app store and get a calculator.
12      What it comes down to is that the plaintiff's
13      witnesses are saying that all you need is a
14      calculator to diagnose someone with addiction,
15      that's all you need.
16           Why did the $40-million-man come in and
17      testify from that stand when all you need, all you
18      need is just to add up the cigarettes?  We'll just
19      add them up.  That's addiction, we'll just add.
20      One, two, three, four, we'll get to the point.
21      That's how we're going to determine whether
22      somebody is addicted or not.  It's really
23      Dr. Benowitz's point.
24           Dr. Barnett, what did she do?  She said, Look,
25      I put my faith in the American Psychiatric Association.  I put my faith in the DSM-5.  So I am
2      going to use that and apply actual diagnostic
3      criteria to determine whether or not this man was
4      addicted.
[#DELETED RECESS#]
[#DELETED COUNCIL DISCUSSION#]
13            MR. HOHNBAUM:  First, let me say thank you for
14       the 10 o'clock start time.  We appreciate it
15       ourselves.
16            Indulge me for just a moment and let me go
17       over, if I could, very briefly just to reorient
18       ourselves about where we were.  We had the three
19       hurdles.  The first two questions on the verdict
20       form deal with class membership.  All the
21       information that you heard in this trial about
22       conspiracies and concealment, what was said and
23       what was not said, are not to be considered when
24       you decide the first two questions on the verdict
25       forms.  You have to put those out of your mind and  you have to focus on the questions -- the first two
2       questions on the verdict form.  The rest of the
3       stuff doesn't matter to those questions.
4            Medical causation, addiction, addiction
5       causation.  We spent a lot of time yesterday
6       talking about medical causation.  Smoking was not a
7       legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's coronary artery
8       disease.  He was going to get it any way because of
9       diabetes.  100 percent, 100 percent certainty.  And
10       coronary artery disease was not a legal cause of
11       Mr. Cavalier's death.
12            He died from COPD.  If he didn't have coronary
13       artery disease, he was going to die anyway.  That
14       is the fact.
15            This is just a brief summary.  He had diabetes
16       since 1974, was poorly controlled.  Diabetes caused
17       the coronary artery disease.  His congestive heart
18       failure, Dr. Wohlgelenter went through it
19       painstakingly, x-ray by x-ray.  It was treated and
20       under control.  The ejection fraction he had in
21       1990 was the same ejection fraction he had two
22       weeks before he passed away.  And they're claiming
23       that caused his death.
24            And severe COPD.  There is no doubt he had
25       severe COPD.  Exacerbations, in the hospital,  infections, there is no question he had COPD.
2            The plaintiff has the burden here, folks, to
3       prove medical causation to you, and as I did
4       yesterday with the verdict form -- of course, when
5       you give lawyers more time to do something, they
6       will do it.
7            All right.  So two components to that verdict
8       form:  Was smoking a cause of the coronary artery
9       disease?  No.
10            Was coronary artery disease a legal cause of
11       his death?  No.
12            All right.  Let me move on to where I was
13       starting yesterday.
14            Even if they prove to you those two things --
15       smoking caused the coronary artery disease, and
16       coronary artery disease caused his death -- they
17       still have to prove to you that Mr. Cavalier was
18       addicted.
19            As with every question, you need to decide in
20       this case, where do you go to determine what the
21       law is?  You go to the instructions, and here's
22       what the instruction says.  I've got to tell you,
23       you are -- you can look through those as hard as
24       you want to, and as carefully as you want to and
25       you will not see the term "addiction" defined.  You  won't see it defined.
2            And so one of the things you're going to have
3       to decide as a jury is what does the term
4       "addiction" mean, and who are -- what are you going
5       to use to help you decide that.
6            Well, I talked a little bit about the DSM-5.
7       We're going to talk about that in a second.
8            Half of all daily smokers -- current, state of
9       the art knowledge of addiction -- are not addicted.
10            Smokers smoke for reasons other than
11       addiction.  Right?  If half the people are addicted
12       and half the people are not addicted, those are
13       daily smokers, some people are smoking for reasons
14       other than addiction to nicotine.  And we talked
15       about some of those reasons with Dr. Barnett.  We
16       talked about some of that with Dr. Feingold.  I
17       think Dr. Benowitz also answered questions about
18       that.
19            And then Dr. Barnett talked about the
20       half-life nicotine and peak saturation.  And I want
21       to do it this way, ladies and gentlemen of the
22       jury:  A sponge can only absorb so much water.
23       Think about it.  If you take a daily vitamin, one
24       vitamin.  Do you take 10 vitamins in the morning?
25       No.  Because your body cannot absorb all of those  vitamins.  So you take one, just like a sponge.
2       Just like a sponge.
3            The fact of the matter is Mr. Cavalier smoking
4       a cigarette every 10 minutes, every 12 minutes,
5       cannot be -- nicotine cannot be the reason he's
6       doing that.  Why?  Because the nicotine is staying
7       at a peak level, it never goes down.  If people
8       smoke and they smoke one cigarette every 30
9       minutes, the nicotine level goes down a little bit.
10       They can have some feeling of withdrawal and they
11       want the nicotine again to get that level of
12       nicotine back up.  But somebody who smokes as much
13       as Mr. Cavalier was not doing it solely for the
14       nicotine.  He couldn't be.  It never went down.  He
15       was saturated.  There was no more.
16            There had to be other reasons, and there were
17       other reasons.  Taste, smell, enjoyment,
18       relaxation, boredom.  Driving was his vocation, was
19       his job.
20            So here's what it comes down to:  If you
21       define "addiction" by just the number of
22       cigarettes, right -- so we heard five cigarettes in
23       this trial.  If you smoke five cigarettes a day,
24       you're addicted.  Some people said 10 cigarettes
25       and you're addicted.  Some people said a pack a day  and you're addicted.  If you just define
2       "addiction" by the number of cigarettes, then,
3       okay, he's addicted.  Right?  It's circular.  If
4       that's the definition, then he meets that
5       definition.
6            Or you can choose to apply some actual
7       diagnostic criterion besides a calculator.  On the
8       one hand, they say it's a serious medical
9       condition, and on the other, all they say you need
10       to define it is a calculator.  Right?
11            100 percent of smokers.  Every smoker gets a
12       smoking-related disease was addicted.  $40 million,
13       $40 million to come in and tell you it's just one
14       cigarette after another.  That's all it takes --
15            MR. GARY:  I'm going to object.  He didn't get
16       paid no $40 million.
17            THE COURT:  Overruled.
18            MR. GARY:  That's ridiculous.
19            MR. HOHNBAUM:  $40 million.  The Fagerstrom
20       test, that's what they used.  That's what
21       Dr. Feingold said on the stand is used to determine
22       whether or not somebody is addicted.  The fact of
23       the matter is that test can be gotten off the
24       Internet.  You can fill it out in five minutes.
25            There was some discussion about, Well,  DSM -- Mr. Chestnut, the DSM, you have to be alive.
2       What is this?  After you wake up.  I mean, that
3       test is designed to be pulled off the Internet and
4       filled out, and it can be done in five minutes.
5       Anyone can apply and administer it, and there is no
6       expertise, no judgment no clinical analysis, no
7       learning, no education, no judgment whatsoever.
8            And then even the plaintiff's experts disagree
9       about this.  So Dr. Feingold -- that's what doctors
10       typically use, they use the Fagerstrom.  What did
11       Dr. Benowitz say?  It's not typically used as a
12       test to determine whether or not somebody is
13       addicted, because the test assumes you are addicted
14       and then determines what sort of severity that
15       addiction is.  That's the Fagerstrom test.
16            Let me put to rest this concept of brain
17       changes somehow impacting this analysis.  It is
18       another red herring.  All right?
19            For 100 years, it's been known that nicotine
20       affects the body's receptors.  We all have nicotine
21       receptors in our body.  After a smoker quits, a
22       period of time, different for each smoker, but not
23       a long period of time, the receptors go back to
24       normal after a few weeks.  Everybody says to the
25       extent those increased brain receptors that go back  to normal, to the extent that is occurring in
2       somebody, it doesn't prevent that smoker from
3       quitting.  Everybody can quit.
4            And of course, it doesn't affect -- it's not
5       like intoxication, right?  It doesn't affect
6       anybody's ability to understand and appreciate the
7       risks of smoking.
8            And you remember the dopamine slide.  We
9       didn't put it back up here.  We had the
10       methamphetamine off the charts, and then we had
11       cocaine, and then we had nicotine and caffeine.
12       The amount of dopamine that's released from
13       nicotine is just about equivalent to the amount of
14       dopamine that's released with caffeine.
15            But let me be clear:  Nicotine is addictive.
16       It can be addictive in certain people.  No one is
17       running from that.  No one is denying that.  No one
18       is suggesting otherwise.
19            The issue isn't whether it's addictive.  The
20       issue is whether or not Mr. Cavalier was addicted.
21            So what -- what do we have?  We have the
22       DSM-5.  Again, do you want to use the Internet tool
23       as a test for addiction, or do you want clinical
24       analysis?
25            The DSM-5 is the gold standard.  Nobody denied  that.  Dr. Benowitz, their own witness, what did he
2       say about the DSM-5?  He said that the DSM-5 is the
3       Bible.  The Bible in the U.S. for the diagnosis of
4       substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders.
5       They can't have it both ways.  Is it a substance
6       abuse disorder or not?  If it is, the way you go
7       about diagnosing it is to use a tool that requires
8       clinical analysis and judgment.
9            And that's exactly what Dr. Barnett did.  She
10       walked through it.  Why didn't Dr. Feingold walk
11       through the DSM-5?  He didn't want walk to through
12       the DSM-5 because he knew what the answer was.  He
13       knew what the answer was that if you went through
14       the DSM-5, there was not going to be a finding of
15       addiction, so he went back to Fagerstrom, he went
16       back to the calculator.  And the DSM-5 requires
17       clinically significant impairment or distress.
18       That's what it requires.  It requires that your
19       life is impaired or you're distressed because of
20       your smoking.
21            Evidence, evidence beyond number of cigarettes
22       is required under the DSM-5.
23            You assess the evidence you heard in the case
24       under the construct of the DSM-5.  Listen to
25       Dr. Barnett.  You can see the criteria.  He was  able to quit.  He quit the first time he was
2       motivated to do so, and there was no evidence when
3       he quit that he suffered some serious withdrawal,
4       that he had some serious problem, that he somehow
5       couldn't function in life because he had stopped
6       smoking.  Was there any evidence of withdrawal?
7       You had some witnesses say, well, maybe he went
8       down to two cigarettes or snuck a cigarette here or
9       there after 1989.  Did anybody say -- think about
10       it?  He is smoking five packs of cigarettes a day.
11       If he goes down to one or two cigarettes, people,
12       A, they are going to notice it.  They are going to
13       notice it, and then they are going to notice if
14       it's causing him any problems.  And did anybody say
15       it caused him any problems?  No.
16            The fact of the matter is some people can
17       quit, and they can quit easily.  And that's exactly
18       the case for Mr. Cavalier.
19            That's not to say that people don't struggle
20       with quitting, some people do.  But the evidence in
21       this case is that he didn't.
22            Evidence.  Facts.
23            Mr. Cavalier was not addicted.  But, look,
24       even if they convince you of the medical causation,
25       even if they convince you -- even if they carry  their burden of proof on addiction, they still have
2       to prove that addiction to cigarettes manufactured
3       by R.J. Reynolds was a legal cause of his death.
4       Where do you go first to determine what the answer
5       to that question is?  The law, what you have to
6       follow in this case.
7            But for the addiction to cigarettes
8       manufactured by R.J. Reynolds, the coronary artery
9       disease and death would not have occurred.  Because
10       if you get to this point, you've already determined
11       that the coronary artery disease was caused by
12       smoking and it caused his death.  They have to
13       prove to you that but for the addiction to R.J.
14       Reynolds cigarettes, he would not have had the
15       disease and died.
16            This is the first date any witness claims to
17       have seen Mr. Cavalier smoke R.J. Reynolds
18       cigarettes, 1961, one of the daughters.  The first
19       time.
20            We talked about this a little bit yesterday.
21       Every single picture in this case has him smoking
22       cigarettes other than cigarettes manufactured by
23       R.J. Reynolds.  They have to prove to you that
24       addiction to R.J. Reynolds cigarettes, not somebody
25       else's cigarettes, not some other packs of  cigarettes, not somebody else's cigarettes caused
2       the disease.  And smoking a pack or two of Kools
3       or -- there's no suggestion that a pack or two or
4       even a carton of Kools over the course of his life
5       would do it.
6            They have to prove to you that addiction to
7       R.J. Reynolds cigarettes was the legal cause of his
8       coronary artery disease and death.
9            Pictures.
10            Even if they prove to you that R.J. Reynolds
11       cigarettes were in the mix, the issue is did
12       Mr. Cavalier have the ability to quit but chose to
13       continue to smoke, or was he rendered powerless?
14       Did the nicotine -- the addiction to nicotine drive
15       him, was it so powerful that he couldn't quit?
16            Because if he could quit, then it wasn't the
17       addiction that caused a disease, it was his choice
18       not to quit.
19            Yesterday Mr. Gary stood up here for the first
20       time in this case -- for the first time in this
21       case and said that plaintiff conceded Mr. Cavalier
22       was at fault.  None of the witnesses said that.
23       Dr. Feingold didn't say that.  None of the
24       plaintiff's witnesses said that.  But think about
25       that.  What does that mean in this context?  What  does it mean?
2            It means that it was his -- look, if he was --
3       ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he was
4       powerless, nicotine made him powerless, then he
5       wasn't at fault.  Right?  How could he be at fault,
6       if it was the nicotine?
7            The admission means that he chose to begin
8       smoking R.J. Reynolds cigarettes despite knowing
9       the risks.  He knew that smoking was dangerous.  He
10       was not confused about the dangers and
11       addictiveness of smoking.
12            Was there any testimony at any point in time?
13       He said, "Well I didn't know that.  I didn't know
14       that.  I didn't think that."  There wasn't.
15            It says that he was responsible for quitting
16       smoking.  And that if he wasn't able to quit
17       smoking, how could he be at fault?  How could he be
18       at fault for anything if he wasn't able to quit
19       smoking?  Of course he was able to quit smoking,
20       and he was able to quit smoking at any time.
21            We've talked about this before.  Nicotine
22       addiction does not rob smokers of free will or as
23       Dr. Benowitz says, somehow change them into robots.
24       It doesn't do that.
25            Addicted smokers, even if they are addicted,  are responsible for their own actions, and
2       decisions to quit or not to quit.
3            Where do we have more agreement in this case
4       than on this point?  Every single expert, whatever
5       their opinion is about what the definition of
6       addiction is says any smoker can quit, every single
7       one of them.  And it's not just people who smoke a
8       little bit, people who smoke a pack a day.
9            Let's hear what Dr. Benowitz has to say.  Do
10       we have that, Jesse?
11  12            "QUESTION:  And most of the people who quit
13       smoking, the 60 million that we talked about just a
14       second ago, and most of those 60 million people
15       would have met your criteria for being highly
16       addicted to cigarettes, correct?
17            "ANSWER:  A fair number.  I don't know what --
18       a fair number, yes."
19            (Video clip stopped.)
20            MR. HOHNBAUM:  That's Dr. Benowitz.  It's not
21       just folks who smoke a pack a day, half a pack a
22       day, two packs a day.  It's highly addicted
23       smokers.
24            Dr. Proctor and the people who quit weren't
25       just light smokers, it included heavy smokers as  well.  And then he says it did.  Many people were
2       smoking, one, two, three, four, or even more packs
3       a day.  Absolute agreement on this point.
4       Mr. Cavalier, a five-pack-a-day smoker could, in
5       fact, quit.
6            We know millions and millions and millions and
7       millions of people were quitting smoking in the
8       '50s, '60s, and '70s.  Millions of people chose to
9       quit smoking.  Their choice.  They chose.  And many
10       of them were heavy addicted smokers like
11       Mr. Cavalier.  60 million.
12            Then you can ask yourself was Mr. Cavalier
13       different?  Was there anything about Mr. Cavalier
14       that made him different from 60 million other
15       smokers who quit?  Were his cigarettes more
16       addictive?  Was his brain affected differently?
17       Was he exposed to advertising different from
18       somebody else?  Did he smoke for longer than the
19       smokers who quit?  We just know from Dr. Benowitz
20       and Dr. Proctor that there were millions of people
21       who quit smoking who were heavy smokers, or did he
22       make the choice to continue to smoke until 1989,
23       when he quit for the first time and he was
24       motivated to quit?
25            Motivation. Another place where we have consensus.
2       Motivation is the key to quitting.  Let me go to
3       Dr. Benowitz.
4  5            "QUESTION:  We alluded to a few of those a
6       amount ago, but you agree that being motivated,
7       being motivated to quit is essential to
8       successfully quitting smoking, right?
9            "ANSWER:  Yes.
10            "QUESTION:  Now, you would agree that
11       sometimes people say "I want to quit," but they
12       don't really mean it.
13            "ANSWER:  I'm sure that happens.
14            "QUESTION:  And if someone doesn't want to
15       quit, they're not going to quit, right?
16            "ANSWER:  That's true.
17            "QUESTION:  Motivation and commitment are
18       essential elements of the ability to quit smoking,
19       correct?
20            "ANSWER:  Yes.
21            "QUESTION:  People can say they want to quit
22       but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are
23       committed to doing so, right?
24            "ANSWER:  Yes."
25            (Video clip stopped.) MR. HOHNBAUM:  That's clear as a bell.  Their
2       own witness.
3            We did talk about his personality in this
4       case, right?  Because that's important to
5       understand the issues in this case as it relates to
6       whether or not he had the internal constitution,
7       the personality that would allow him to quit
8       smoking if he wanted to.
9            He was intelligent, he was hardworking, of
10       course he was.  He was resilient.  Dr. Barnett
11       talked about that.  He was responsible.  He made
12       his own decisions about smoking.  And, frankly, the
13       testimony was no one could really tell him
14       anything.  He was his own man.  He was his own man.
15            And the fact of the matter, he was not
16       motivated to quit.
17            So we have all the experts saying every smoker
18       can quit.  Even his own family said since the
19       1960s, when they encouraged him to quit, "We know
20       you can do it."  They knew what kind of man he was.
21       He was the kind of man that if he set his mind to
22       something, he was going to do it.
23            He wasn't rendered powerless by nicotine.
24       That's not Mr. Cavalier.  He wasn't rendered
25       powerless.  He made his own decisions.  From  Mrs. Fanali's own mouth, whether or not he was
2       going to quit was his own decision.  His own
3       decision.  Don't let facts that have nothing to do
4       with this question or any of these other questions
5       related to class membership get you stumbled up.
6            He could make his own decision to quit.
7            If you think about the plaintiff's theory,
8       it's that Mr. Cavalier had no idea that smoking was
9       dangerous, and he never quit.  He had no idea that
10       smoking was dangerous.  That couldn't be any
11       clearer.  That's their testimony.  That's what they
12       are trying to prove, he didn't know.  And they are
13       saying if he had known, if somehow he had been told
14       information, and Mr. Persons will address this, he
15       would have made a different decision.  There is no
16       way he would have done something that he knew was
17       going to harm him.  Right?  That's their theory.
18            But look -- and this is what -- sometimes when
19       we're putting on evidence, it's not clear, and it
20       can't be until we get to this point to explain to
21       you why it matters.  Right?  And Mr. Cavalier's
22       handling of his diabetes is not a knock on
23       Mr. Cavalier, it's not impugning his character,
24       it's not suggesting he was a bad person.  It has
25       nothing to do with that.  What it has to do with is  he knew that diabetes was harmful because his mom
2       had died of diabetes.  He had been treated since
3       1974.  He knew what a wicked disease diabetes was.
4            And then we know, and look at the records,
5       mouth sores.  Let's go chase that rabbit all you
6       want and look at those medical records, and you
7       tell me whether any of those medical records
8       suggest that he was eating his ice cream for mouth
9       sores, or whether there was any evidence around
10       that time that he had mouth sores.  And that's --
11       that's the ultimate red herring.
12            The fact of the matter is he made his choice.
13       He knew it could harm him.  He wanted to do it.  It
14       debunks the notion that somehow if he would have
15       known smoking was harmful, he would never do
16       anything to harm his body.  And this suggestion
17       about physical activity, look at the pictures and
18       determine whether or not -- you whether you heard
19       any testimony about his physical inactivity before
20       this time period.
21            He was a truck driver and a limo driver.
22       There was no testimony that he was going to the
23       gym.  There was no testimony that he was going for
24       strolls.  There was no testimony about that.
25            Facts, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  Not  speculation, not guesswork.  Facts.
2            We -- this has been beaten to death, right?
3       Throughout this time period, his glucose levels
4       were off the charts.  And it wasn't because he
5       wasn't being treated.  He was being treated.  It
6       was because he had made a decision, knowing that it
7       could harm him, knowing that it could kill him,
8       knowing that it could cause hospitalization,
9       because he was hospitalized.  He made the decision
10       to continue to engage in behavior that was harming
11       his health.
12            What didn't he do?  What do we know he didn't
13       do.  If he was motivated to quit, if he had a
14       persistent desire, if he was committed, what would
15       be the first thing you would do?  What would be the
16       first thing you would you do?  You would throw away
17       your cigarettes.  You'd get them out of your sight.
18       You would throw away your ashtrays, if he was
19       motivated.
20            He was seeing doctors.  Is there any evidence
21       that he went to a doctor and said, "Please help me
22       stop smoking"?  No evidence that he went to a stop
23       smoke cessation clinic.  And you can weigh the
24       evidence on whether he actually tried to quit, but
25       let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,  if he actually tried to quit and did so for half a
2       day, a day, two days, he is smoking five packs a
3       day, that would be monumental.  No one would miss
4       it.  No one would think, oh -- it would be big news
5       in that household.
6            Did anybody say anything about that?  The
7       answer is no.  To the extent he had some desire to
8       do it, it was to appease his wife who we know
9       didn't like his smoking.
10            Finally, on this point, the best evidence he
11       could quit is it Dr. Benowitz?  Is it Dr. Proctor?
12       Is it Dr. Feingold?  Is it Dr. Barnett?  No.  The
13       best evidence is that he did.
14            THE CLERK:  10 minutes counsel.
15            MR. HOHNBAUM:  That's the best evidence.  When
16       he was motivated to quit, he quit.
17            And you look at the records.  He quit smoking
18       prior to his lung cancer diagnosis.  The lung
19       cancer diagnosis did not cause him to quit.  He
20       quit with his brother before he was diagnosed.  He
21       decided he was going to quit and he did.
22            Now, look, the number of medical records that
23       document that he quit permanently in 1989, 34.  You
24       saw this in opening.  Right?  You will have all
25       these records.  34 records. Why are they spending all of this time trying
2       to convince you that Mr. Cavalier never stopped
3       smoking until he couldn't smoke any more?  Why?
4       Why not say on memories, it's back a little bit,
5       I'm not exactly sure.  I mean, I can't be
6       confident.  I don't remember.
7            Why this clinging to "he quit" in the face of
8       34 medical records, doctor after doctor, hospital
9       visit after hospital visit, doctor visit after
10       doctor visit.
11            Folks, if you are smoking and I'm this far
12       away from you, we know it.  Look at the medical
13       records.  There's no reference in the medical
14       records to "he says he's not smoking but I can
15       smell that he's smoking," or anything to suggest
16       that, in fact, he actually quit smoking.
17            The reason they are trying so hard to persuade
18       you that Mr. Cavalier never quit smoking is because
19       they know, just like we know, that if he quit
20       smoking in 1989, they cannot meet their burden to
21       prove that addiction to R.J. Reynolds cigarettes
22       caused any disease.  That's why they -- that's why.
23       That's why we're doing this dance.
24            What is this?  Well, isn't it true -- who went
25       to doctors' visits with Mr. Cavalier?  Mrs. Fanali  did.  She accompanied her dad.  She's a good
2       daughter helping out her father.  Went to the
3       doctors' visits.
4            "Well, isn't it true that neither you nor your
5       father were ever trying to mislead your father's
6       doctors or nurses by giving them wrong
7       information?"
8            What is the information that the doctors had?
9       That he quit.  And what's the answer?  He either
10       did or he didn't, folks.  He either quit smoking or
11       he didn't.  The answer was:  No.  No, sir.  He
12       might have.  Who knows?  He might have quit.  Who
13       knows if they didn't get that wrong, because I can
14       prove that he did not quit smoking.
15            Getting caught up in the facts of the case,
16       the facts are he quit; we can't say he quit,
17       because if we say he quit, we can't prove that
18       addiction caused the disease.
19            Can't both be true, right?  The medical
20       records can't be true if he didn't quit smoking.
21            "You never heard him lie to the doctors or the
22       nurses about his medical history, did you?"
23            "Not that -- no."
24            Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the
25       plaintiffs have failed to prove to you that  Mr. Cavalier was addicted or that addiction to
2       R.J. Reynolds cigarettes was a legal cause of any
3       disease.  The answer to this question, if you get
4       to it, and you shouldn't get to it, let me make
5       that very clear, is no.
6            Thank you for your attention.  I'm going to
7       turn things over to Mr. Persons.


14            MR. PERSONS:  Counsel, Mrs. Fanali, ladies and
15       gentlemen, good morning.
16            We've been together for three weeks now, and I
17       want to add my voice to the chorus and thank you
18       for your patience, your indulgence, your dedication
19       to this process.  Without you, obviously it
20       wouldn't function, and you've been most attentive,
21       and we all greatly, greatly appreciate it.
22            I'm going to talk to you about the last five
23       questions on the verdict form, and I won't spend a
24       lot of time doing it.  We'll move through it as
25       efficiently as we can, but they are very, very,  like all the questions, they are very important
2       questions.
3            When we started this process, I told you that
4       it was my objective to bring you the evidence that
5       would help you answer the questions on the verdict
6       form.  And I submit we've done that, and I'll go
7       through some of that at this time.
8            The Questions 3 and 4:  "Did Thomas Cavalier
9       reasonably rely to his detriment on either a
10       statement or omission of material fact made by
11       R.J. Reynolds that concealed or omitted material
12       information not otherwise known or available
13       concerning the health effects or the addictive
14       nature of smoking cigarettes; and if so, was such
15       reliance a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's coronary
16       artery disease and death?"
17            If you answer no to Question 3, you skip to
18       Question 4 and proceed to Question 5.  I submit to
19       you the answer will be no.  We'll talk about why.
20            Number 4.  "Did Thomas Cavalier reasonably
21       rely to his detriment on either a statement or
22       omission made in furtherance of R.J. Reynolds'
23       agreement to conceal information not otherwise
24       known or available concerning the health effects or
25       addictive nature of smoking cigarettes; and if so,  was such reliance a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's
2       coronary artery disease?"
3            Again, it's no.
4            And then we look at the jury instructions,
5       because they provide us guidance in making this
6       determination.  The issue for your determination on
7       plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment
8       against R.J. Reynolds is whether Mr. Cavalier
9       reasonably relied to his detriment on either a
10       statement or an omission made by R.J. Reynolds that
11       concealed or omitted material information,
12       information that was not otherwise known or
13       available, regarding the health effects of
14       cigarettes or their addictive nature, and whether
15       such reliance was a legal cause of his coronary
16       artery disease and death.
17            And then the law helps us.  It provides us
18       guidance in terms of telling us what that means.
19       In this case, a material fact is one that is of
20       such importance that Mr. Cavalier would not have
21       acted as he did but for the concealment or omission
22       of that fact.
23            In other words, it would be a game-changer.
24       It's that kind of fact.  It's a material fact.  Not
25       just any fact, but a material fact. And in order to meet their burden, the
2       plaintiff has to show that there is a connection
3       between concealment and agreement to conceal and
4       Mr. Cavalier's coronary artery disease that they
5       contend was the cause of death and they failed to
6       prove that Mr. Cavalier died because of the dangers
7       and addictiveness of smoking were unknown or
8       unavailable to you.
9            You cannot conceal what is already known, and
10       we're going to demonstrate what was already known.
11            Reasonable reliance on either a statement or
12       omission by R.J. Reynolds that concealed or omitted
13       information, material information, was a legal
14       cause if it directly and in a natural and
15       continuous sequence caused the death so that it can
16       reasonably be said that but for the reliance the
17       coronary artery disease and death would not have
18       occurred.
19            This means that plaintiff must prove that but
20       for Mr. Cavalier's reasonable reliance on either a
21       statement or an omission made by R.J. Reynolds that
22       concealed or omitted material facts not otherwise
23       known or available, Mr. Cavalier would have acted
24       differently, and he would have acted differently in
25       such a way that he would have avoided coronary  artery disease and death.
2            Now, Mr. Cavalier did not die because the
3       dangers and addictiveness of smoking were unknown
4       or unavailable.  Again, you can't conceal what's
5       already known.
6            We started this case, we showed you an article
7       from Reader's Digest, I believe it was 1923, that
8       talked about the dangers of smoking.  They had the
9       Reader's Digest in the home.  Plaintiff contends
10       that Mr. Cavalier couldn't read or write, but other
11       members of the family could, and when you have a
12       member of the family that can't read and write,
13       oftentimes you read to that person.  If there's
14       information that you've encountered that might be
15       helpful to that person, you feel incumbent upon
16       yourself to share it with them, to tell them about
17       it.  Even though they can't read and write, you
18       provide it to them.  You do that for them.  And the
19       information was out there.
20            What we do know is for over 100 years it's
21       been known, and Dr. Benowitz, their expert,
22       Dr. Proctor, their expert, both said that it's been
23       known for over 100 years that nicotine is in
24       tobacco.  That it's in tobacco.  Nicotine has a
25       pharmacological effect on the human body. Now, what does that mean?  Pharmacological.
2       The root word is pharmacology, which is the science
3       of the composition, the uses, and the effects of
4       drugs.  That's what pharmacology means.  So if
5       you've known that for 100 years, you've known about
6       the makeup of nicotine, the composition, you've
7       known about its uses, and you've known about its
8       effects, nicotine affects the body's receptors.
9       That's been known for over 100 years.
10            Didn't need somebody to come along in the
11       1970s or somebody to come on the witness stand and
12       say that, well, you know, upregulation of the
13       acetylcholine nicotine receptors occurs with the
14       use of nicotine.  That's been known that it affects
15       the receptors for over 100 years.  That's their
16       experts.  It's also been known that it's difficult
17       to quit.  That's been known for over 100 years.
18            What we do know is that the first time anybody
19       places a Reynolds product in Mr. Cavalier's hand
20       was in 1961, but we know that back in the '50s,
21       this was the testimony in front of Congress.  Here
22       is Leroy Barney, who was the Surgeon General of the
23       United States, he said in front of Congress:  "The
24       public health community had done an excellent job
25       at warning the public about the dangers of  smoking."
2            What does the National Cancer Institute, the
3       head of the National Cancer Institute, what does he
4       say?  "The powerful and frightening information
5       coming out about the dangers -- I'm sorry.  That's
6       Dr. Proctor.  "The powerful and frightening" -- I
7       got that.  Let me get back to it.
8            This is Dr. Proctor, Robert Proctor.  He said:
9       "The powerful and frightening information coming
10       out about the dangers of smoking scared millions of
11       people into quitting."
12            And we showed you those mouse skin-painting
13       studies where they were in Life Magazine, and they
14       showed the tumors on the backs of the mice.  Very
15       graphic information about the dangers of smoking.
16       The tar that they painted on the backs of the mice
17       was the same tar that's in cigarette smoke.
18            So do you need to know that polonium is in it,
19       do you need to know that acetone is in, to know
20       that it causes cancer?  Isn't it sufficient to know
21       that the tar in cigarette smoke caused cancer on
22       the backs of those mice?  And they used the backs
23       of the mice because the tissue on the backs of the
24       mice is comparable to the tissue in the human lung.
25       It was known and available. Here's what Dr. Proctor also tells us.  He
2       told us:  "The publicity around those studies in
3       the early 1950s made a significant portion of
4       people fear for their lives and it stimulated
5       quitting in this country."
6            That was the question.
7            "Exactly.  It's when the first great wave of
8       quitting becomes.  It's when you get the first
9       significant self-help manuals to help people quit."
10            "Question:  All right.  It scared millions of
11       people into quitting in the early 1950s, didn't
12       it?"
13            "Answer:  It did."
14            "And then this quitting was driven by people's
15       fears and concerns about the dangers of smoking?"
16            He said:  "Yes, it was."
17            He talks about the self-help manuals.  I
18       didn't say that.  Those are his words.  Self-help
19       manuals that came out during that time to help
20       people quit, those who were motivated to quit.
21       Millions were motivated to quit.  That was back in
22       the 1950s when this research first started coming
23       out.
24            Mr. Cavalier was not one of them.  Am I
25       faulting Mr. Cavalier?  No, absolutely not, because  it was a person's choice whether they wanted to
2       continue in the activity or they wanted to take
3       steps to discontinue it for their health.
4            This question was put to Donna Fanali about
5       whether her father knew about addiction and that
6       smoking was addictive.
7            Question:  "Also in the 1950s and '60s, based
8       on what you knew about your father, you believe
9       your father understood that smoking was addictive,
10       correct?"
11            "Yes, I think he knew smoking was addictive."
12            Now, this is before he ever was first seen
13       smoking a Reynolds cigarette in 1961.  She says
14       going back into the 1950s, using her exact words,
15       "When I was a kid, my father knew smoking was
16       addictive."
17            So do you need the 1988 Surgeon General's
18       report to tell you that smoking is addictive if you
19       already know?  It can't be concealed from you if
20       you already know.  It can't be a secret if you
21       already know.  The information was known and
22       available.
23            In the early 1960s, Jeanne would tell her
24       father, "You're addicted to cigarettes," and his
25       response was he knew he was addicted. We talked about the epidemiology studies that
2       came out in the 1950s showing a strong correlation
3       between smoking and lung cancer.  Dr. Proctor
4       testified about the Wynder and Graham study.  He
5       testified about the mouse skin-painting study.  He
6       testified about the Surgeon General's report.  He
7       testified about the 1966 warning label.  All of
8       these were big news stories.  These things led to
9       millions of people being scared of smoking and they
10       quit.
11            It was big news.  And what do we know about
12       big news?  We know that this is the kind of thing
13       that Mr. Cavalier watched on TV.
14            Question:  "When he came home early enough to
15       watch the nightly news, he did watch the nightly
16       news?"
17            Answer:  "Yes, if the news was on, he'll watch
18       it."
19            Question:  "All right.  When it came to being
20       informed or being aware of current events, your
21       father was certainly aware of the big news events
22       of the day, correct?"
23            "The bigger ones, yes."
24            Question:  "Things that would be considered,
25       quote, 'big news,' right?" The answer:  "Yes."
2            And of course this was big news.  Dr. Proctor
3       tells us the highest rate of quitting is in that
4       period after the Surgeon General's report when
5       nearly 3 million people were quitting every year.
6       That's really the turning point.
7            In the public health history of the United
8       States of America as it relates to cigarette news,
9       that was the turning point, 1964, because you will
10       recall he said at that point there was the three
11       pillars of the consensus, forum, and the scientific
12       community, public health community, told the
13       American public smoking causes lung cancer, smoking
14       causes emphysema.  1964.  Turning point.
15            Can we play this?
16            (Videotaped deposition played as follows:)
17       Q.   Now, it was known in 1964 that cigarette
18  smokers engaged in highly compulsive use of cigarettes,
19  right?
20       A.   Yes.
21       Q.   It was known in 1964 that cigarette smoking
22  had psychoactive effects, right?
23       A.   Yes.
24       Q.   And it was known in 1964 that cigarette
25  smoking led to drug reinforced behavior, correct?  A.   Yes.
2       Q.   All of those things were known in 1964?
3       A.   Yes.
4       Q.   It wasn't some secret that anybody was keeping
5  under wraps, right?
6       A.   Correct.
7       Q.   Well-known to the medical and scientific
8  community, correct?
9       A.   Yes.
10       Q.   As you told us, you know, within the last 30
11  or 40 minutes, many of these things were known 100 years
12  ago?
13       A.   Yes.
14            (Videotaped deposition was concluded.)
15            MR. PERSONS:  Known and available.  No secret.
16       In fact, the criteria that were just set out in
17       that question that was put to Dr. Benowitz, it was
18       same criteria that appeared in the 2010 Surgeon
19       General's report.  What was known and available
20       back in 1964.  It was no secret.
21            Here's what Cheryl Lupo said on the stand:  "I
22       wish they would have told him years ago that it was
23       bad for him, that it would -- the chemicals."
24            And Dr. Robert Proctor told you that R.J.
25       Reynolds disclosed all of the compounds identified  in cigarette smoke, including new and previously
2       unknown ones, to the Surgeon General's advisory
3       committee in 1964, and the Surgeon General's
4       committee published them as carcinogens in smoke in
5       the 1964 Surgeon General's report.
6            Now, Dr. Proctor also said, well, they didn't
7       point out to the scientists in the Surgeon
8       General's office that many of these were
9       carcinogens.  Well, if you're pointing it out to
10       scientists, they knew, and when they wrote the
11       report, they published them as carcinogens,
12       cancer-causing chemicals.
13            Do I need to go through and point out each one
14       of the cancer-causing chemicals if you're a smoker
15       or use shorthand and say, "This will kill you"?
16       What's going to be more useful to you as a
17       consumer, knowing that the product could kill you,
18       or going through and telling you that it contains
19       all these glycerines and all these other compounds?
20       In short, it kills.  You saw the PSAs.  It kills.
21       You saw Sanford and Son.  "Pop, those things will
22       kill you."
23            1966, Dr. Proctor said Congress required the
24       cigarette makers to make the label.  The warning
25       label had to be prominent.  It had to be prominent.  And of course it was.  "Caution:  Cigarette smoking
2       may be hazardous to your health."
3            The plaintiff has stipulated in this case that
4       the warning was adequate, that it was adequate,
5       that it was sufficient.  That's what adequacy
6       means.  It's sufficient to put the consumer on
7       notice.  Sufficient to put the smoker on notice of
8       the dangerous nature of this product.  It's
9       hazardous to your health.  In other words, it's bad
10       for you.  It's bad for you.
11            And so she said, "I wish they would have told
12       him years ago that it was bad for you."
13            They did.  They told him in the '50s and they
14       told him in 1964 in the Surgeon General's report.
15       And, again, for 140,000 times, at least if you're
16       smoking five packs a day, this information was
17       available.  Now, whether you paid attention to it
18       or not, that's your own business, but it was there.
19            If you don't pay attention to something that's
20       on the product that you are using 100 times a day,
21       what makes you think that he would have paid
22       attention to a memo from R.J. Reynolds that said,
23       Well, nicotine is addictive?  Or that there are
24       chemicals in cigarette smoke?  No.
25            We know from Jeanne Dupuis' testimony, she  remembers a PSA about the warning on the side of
2       the cigarette packs.  And this is a PSA about the
3       warning on the side of the cigarette packs.
4            Would you play that.
5  6            SPEAKER:  We receive many warnings in our
7       life, and sometimes they can save our life.  This
8       message is brought to you by the American Cancer
9       Society.
10            (Video clip stopped.)
11            MR. PERSONS:  The sponsor of the message
12       alone, the name of that organization tells you
13       everything you need to know.  If it doesn't cause
14       cancer, why is the American Cancer Society telling
15       you that this is a dangerous product?  That this is
16       a dangerous activity?  But you're an adult, be free
17       to make your own choices but it's a dangerous,
18       dangerous activity.  And this kind of information
19       was so widespread, it was so widely known, that the
20       head of the organization, Dr. Horn, Daniel Horn,
21       who was with Hammond and Horn, they did the
22       epidemiological studies in the 1950s.  And in the
23       1960s, Daniel Horn has become head of what was
24       called the National Clearinghouse on Smoking and
25       Health, a federal agency that was charged with  getting out the information to the American public
2       about the dangers of cigarette smoking.  And he
3       said in 1968 that you could stand on a rooftop and
4       shout "Smoking is dangerous" at the top of your
5       lungs, and you would not be telling anyone anything
6       they did not already know.
7            Whether they chose to continue in the activity
8       was their own business, but the public knew.  The
9       public had been warned.
10            In 1970, again, labels required to be
11       prominent.  This was the warning label:  Warning:
12       The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette
13       smoking is dangerous to your health.
14            Again, there is no dispute in the case that
15       this was an adequate warning, that it was adequate,
16       it was sufficient to put the smoker on notice that
17       this activity is dangerous to your health.  It's
18       not good for you.
19            This warning was available to Mr. Cavalier at
20       least 500,000 times between 1970 and 1985, when the
21       rotating warnings began.  Over the 15-year period,
22       that warning would have been available to him
23       500,000 times, and yet he never heeded it.
24            Now, there has been a lot of talk about, Well,
25       if somebody had told the public about  additives, flavorants, in cigarettes, different
2       choices would have been made.
3            Now, you heard Dr. William Farone testify
4       about, in 1972, R.J. Reynolds published a book
5       about the ingredients in its cigarettes.  It was
6       known in 1972 the tobacco companies were using
7       sugar and licorice and cocoa and chocolate syrup in
8       cigarettes.  This book lists hundreds of various
9       flavorants that have been used historically in
10       cigarette products.
11            And in the words of Dr. William Farone,
12       "comprehensive reference to a number of flavor
13       materials useful for flavoring tobacco and a guide
14       to the current state of the art," and they are all
15       listed here.  And it's in evidence.  You will have
16       it back there with you.
17            But I submit to you there is page after page
18       after page after page after page after page after
19       page after page, and this is small print.
20            MR. CHESTNUT:  You missed one.
21            MR. PERSONS:  After page, and it just goes on.
22       These are things that are in the cigarette, and you
23       heard Dr. Farone said that, yes, it would be
24       available in a public library or medical school
25       library, known and available. Known and available.
2            And it goes on and talks about glycerines and
3       things like that, muriatic acid and those kind of
4       things.  It's all in there.
5            This is the warning that came out in 1985 and
6       very explicit:  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart
7       disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
8            I won't go through each of them but the
9       warning is adequate.  The plaintiff has admitted
10       that.  It's adequate.  As a matter of law, it's
11       adequate, and at least more than 140,000 times, it
12       was available to Mr. Cavalier.
13            In short, Mr. Cavalier didn't need any more
14       information to make an informed choice about
15       smoking or quitting.  He chose to continue to
16       smoke.
17            The number of witnesses who said Mr. Cavalier
18       relied on advertisements for his smoking decisions
19       is zero.  You heard a lot of talk about
20       advertising.  There will be a lot of ads in
21       evidence.  But there is no evidence -- there is no
22       testimony or other evidence that it had anything to
23       do with Mr. Cavalier's smoking decisions.  Zero.
24            You heard talk about filter fraud.
25       Dr. Proctor was saying, Well, it was a gimmick or  an illusion.  There are no R.J. Reynolds documents
2       using phrases like "gimmick" or "illusion" to
3       describe filtered cigarettes.  There are no
4       documents from the '60s, '70s, or the '80s, where
5       Reynolds scientists said they believe smokers are
6       getting just as much tar and nicotine as smokers of
7       nonfiltered cigarettes.  There are no documents
8       from the '60s, '70s, or the '80s in which Reynolds
9       scientists state that filters are ineffective.  In
10       fact, what the internal documents show is that the
11       Reynolds scientists expressed that they genuinely
12       believed that filtered cigarettes were better for
13       health.  That was their firmly held and genuine
14       belief.
15            None of the witnesses, the family, they did
16       not tell you that Mr. Cavalier relied on any
17       tobacco company or tobacco industry organization in
18       making his decisions about smoking.  He never said
19       he heard any statements from any tobacco company or
20       tobacco industry organization.
21            And that stands to reason.  Remember, the
22       instruction says reasonable reliance.  A story came
23       out a couple weeks ago from the World Health
24       Organization about bacon causing cancer.  I didn't
25       see anything from Oscar Mayer coming out and saying  anything about it.  But I'm not going to look to
2       Oscar Mayer or the pork producers for health
3       information about eating pork.  Who looks to the
4       Beef Council to tell them anything except beef is
5       what's for dinner?  They don't tell you that's bad
6       for you.  Your doctor tells you, but you don't look
7       to the livestock makers to tell you that the
8       product is bad for you.
9            This is a product that does tell you it's bad
10       for it.  It's on the pack it tells you it's bad for
11       you.  There is nothing on a pack of bacon that says
12       it causes cancer, but you wouldn't look to Oscar
13       Mayer to tell you that anyway, or Budweiser to tell
14       you that the product can make you intoxicated.
15            Now, the Frank Statement, he hadn't heard of
16       it.  No.  Mr. Cavalier didn't rely on the CTR
17       statements?  No.  The Tobacco Industry Research
18       Committee statements?  No.  Tobacco Institute
19       statements?  No, he did not.  Tobacco industry
20       press releases?  No.  He said he didn't read the
21       paper.  Tobacco industry white papers?  No.
22       Tobacco industry interviews or statements.  No
23       evidence that he ever relied on any of these
24       things.  Tobacco Company statements about smoking
25       and health?  No evidence.  Tobacco Company  statements about smoking and addiction?  No.
2            And the case has to be decided on evidence.
3       No evidence of any of these things.  No evidence of
4       reliance.
5            All right.  I submit to you, based on the
6       evidence in this case, the answer to number 3, Did
7       Thomas Cavalier reasonably rely to his detriment on
8       either a statement or omission of material fact
9       made by R.J. Reynolds that concealed or omitted
10       material information not otherwise known or
11       available concerning health effects and that such
12       reliance was a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's
13       coronary artery disease and death?  No.
14            (Off the record discussion.)
15            MS. SCHNEIDER:  There you go.
16            MR. PERSONS:  Thank you, Ms. Schneider.
17            MS. SCHNEIDER:  Got it.
18            MR. PERSONS:  Get it even.  Thank you, ma'am.
19            And then the same thing for number 4.
20            And we go to number 5:  Was there any fault on
21       the part of Thomas Cavalier that was a cause of his
22       coronary artery disease and death?
23            We know the answer to that.  In light of
24       plaintiff's admission yesterday when Mr. Gary was
25       before you.  So we know that there was fault on  part of Thomas Cavalier.  So the answer to that is
2       yes.  We don't have to spend any time on that.  We
3       know the answer to that is yes.  They've admitted
4       that.
5            "Please state what percentage of any fault for
6       Thomas Cavalier's coronary artery disease and death
7       that you charge to R.J. Reynolds and Thomas
8       Cavalier."  Let's talk about that at this time.
9            We talked yesterday, plaintiff conceded
10       Mr. Cavalier's fault.  Ms. Fanali admits it was her
11       father's own decision to quit.  He could have quit
12       sooner and avoided getting a disease.
13            And what does the admission of fault really
14       mean?  It means that Mr. Cavalier chose to begin
15       smoking despite knowing the risks.  That he knew
16       that smoking was dangerous and continued to smoke.
17       That he wasn't confused about the dangers and
18       addictiveness of smoke, because if you are confused
19       about it, then you can't have any fault for doing
20       it.  You're absolved of fault if you are confused.
21       Or if are you a victim of misinformation by the
22       tobacco industry, then you have no fault because
23       you're confused.
24            Responsible for quitting smoking.  We know
25       that.  That's what the admission means.  And that  he was able to quit smoking at any time.  He could
2       have quit soon enough to have avoided the adverse
3       health effects of smoking.  That's what the
4       admission means.
5            Mr. Cavalier never blamed the tobacco
6       companies for his decision to smoke and not quit
7       before he did.  In all those years, in
8       conversations with his daughters and with friends,
9       at no time did he ever blame the tobacco companies
10       for the decisions that he made, the decision he
11       made to continue smoking.  Despite all the
12       information he was provided, despite warnings from
13       his own body.
14            "The assignment of fault relates only to
15       actions that were a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's
16       coronary artery disease and death."
17            The but for cause that Mr. Hohnbaum discussed
18       with you all yesterday.
19            "R.J. Reynolds cannot be assigned fault for
20       actions that were not a legal cause of
21       Mr. Cavalier's coronary artery disease and death."
22            It's not a comparison of whose choices were
23       worse, R.J. Reynolds employees who chose to write
24       stupid things in memos and those papers that were
25       shown to you.  But what did that have to do with  causing Mr. Cavalier's coronary artery disease?  It
2       was 100 percent attributable to diabetes.  Those
3       documents had absolutely nothing to do with it.
4            Reynolds' fault starts at zero percent.
5       Plaintiff has the burden to prove by the greater
6       weight of the evidence each and every percentage
7       point of Reynolds' fault.  Every bit of it, they
8       have to prove to you, and I submit to you they have
9       absolutely not.
10            "Per the Court, you may not assign fault to
11       Reynolds for Mr. Cavalier's lung cancer or his
12       COPD."
13            That's not Reynolds' fault.  You can't assign
14       any fault to Reynolds for the lung cancer or COPD
15       that Mr. Cavalier had.  That's out.
16            Now, we know that Mr. Cavalier was responsible
17       for his own smoking, that smokers are responsible
18       for it because even the plaintiff's own expert, Dr.
19       Neal Benowitz, was asked this question:  And
20       smoking cigarettes does not cause the smoker to
21       lose the ability to be responsible for their own
22       actions, correct?
23            Correct.
24            Responsible.
25            Mr. Cavalier ignored repeated, specific,  personalized warnings for decades.  We know that,
2       in the '50s and '60s, he knew that cigarettes were
3       addictive.  His daughters told us that.
4            Starting in the 1960s, Mrs. Cavalier was
5       always hollering at Mr. Cavalier to quit.  That
6       came from Joseph Possidento.  He's the man with Lou
7       Gehrig's disease out in Arizona, cousin to
8       Mr. Cavalier.  He said that he could remember back
9       in Connecticut, growing up in Connecticut, that
10       Mrs. Cavalier was always hollering at Mr. Cavalier
11       to quit.
12            And in the early 1960s, Jeanne was always
13       complaining that she hated her father's smoking and
14       telling him he was addicted.  And he would respond,
15       "Yes, I'm addicted."
16            Jeanne told her father, "You got to stop
17       smoking," and it's difficult enough being a
18       teenager, but it's especially difficult being a
19       teenage girl.  Not that I've been one but I raised
20       one.  And imagine going to school with smoke on
21       your clothes and being teased by other students
22       about smoke being on your clothes.  Do you think
23       your father might pick up the phone and call the
24       smoking cessation clinic?  You think he might throw
25       out his ashtrays?  You think he might refrain from  smoking in the house and just go outside to smoke?
2            This is somebody who obviously enjoyed
3       indulging in this activity.  No matter how
4       offensive it was to other members of his family, no
5       matter how much it yellowed the walls in his house
6       and soiled the furniture and carpets in his house,
7       and caused his children's clothes to smell of
8       smoke.
9            Mr. Cavalier developed a cough, he connected
10       it to smoking.  The family constantly warned him,
11       from 1974 on, to quit because it was harming his
12       health.  Now, this is very interesting because
13       Joseph Possidento is in the throes of Lou Gehrig's
14       disease, but he remembered to the year when it was
15       that Mr. Cavalier developed his cough.  That's over
16       40 years ago, but he remembered it distinctly.  He
17       didn't say in the mid '70s, early '70s.  He said
18       1974.  And he also said that he was coughing to the
19       point he was choking.  That's a warning from your
20       own body.
21            So you've got a warning from the Surgeon
22       General, you've got a warning from the public
23       health community, you've got a warning from your
24       own body.  But the plaintiffs want you to believe
25       that, if he got something from R.J. Reynolds, that  that might change his behavior.  The daughter is
2       complaining about smoke in clothes; the wife is
3       hollering at you about quitting smoking; you are
4       coughing to the point that you're choking.  But no,
5       if they told him that cigarettes contained
6       polonium, yeah, that will do the trick.  That will
7       get him to stop smoking.  That will get him to put
8       the cigarettes down.
9            It defies logic.  It defies all logic.  Jeanne
10       told her father, You've got to stop smoking.
11            Once he developed this bad cough, Possidento
12       told us that the family got on him even more about
13       the need to quit.  And the question was asked of
14       Possidento, did he associate the cough -- this
15       severe cough with smoking?  And the answer was yes.
16       So he knew.  He got plenty of warning.  He knew.
17       That's the most personal warning you can get, is
18       one from your own body.
19            And then he starts treating for COPD.  Under a
20       doctor's care, a pulmonologist's care for COPD.
21       Obviously the state of -- standard of care at that
22       time, according to Dr. Cowen, is that you would
23       tell the patient that, You've got to stop smoking.
24       It's going to make the COPD even worse, the more
25       you smoke. A personal warning.
2            Mr. Cavalier's family and friends developed
3       smoking-related diseases and they died from them.
4       We know that his brother developed bladder cancer
5       that was caused by smoking.  We know that Mrs. Mary
6       Yvancek, very close friends, another couple, of the
7       Cavalier's, Mary Yvancek was a smoker, developed
8       lung cancer, was battling lung cancer.  And
9       Mr. Cavalier was aware of this, but he didn't quit.
10            The number of witnesses who told you
11       Mr. Cavalier made any attempts to quit in response
12       to all of these warnings?  Zero.
13            Here's the testimony of Donna Fanali about
14       Mrs. Mary Yvancek.
15            "QUESTION:  Do you recall your father ever
16       making an effort to quit -- to stop smoking because
17       Mary had died of lung cancer from smoking?
18            "ANSWER:  No, I don't think so."
19            "Did I read that correctly?"
20            "ANSWER:  It said, no, I don't think so
21       because of the fact that she had lung cancer.  I
22       don't think that he -- it resonated with him.  Oh,
23       my God, I've got to stop smoking.  That's what I
24       mean."
25            Well, if this didn't resonate with him, what  would have?  A close personal friend dying of lung
2       cancer from smoking.  And you don't even have a
3       conversation about -- about quitting.
4            No, I don't think it resonated with him.  The
5       warning labels didn't resonate with him, warnings
6       from family members didn't resonate with him.
7       Developing a horrible cough didn't resonate with
8       him.  Death of a close friend from lung cancer from
9       smoking didn't resonate with him.  I don't know
10       what would.
11            Mr. Cavalier's choices are the only legal
12       cause of his coronary artery disease.  Ms. Fanali
13       admitted that no additional information would have
14       mattered.  Only Mr. Cavalier had the ability to
15       decide to quit smoking and prevent his death.
16       Mr. Cavalier received adequate warnings on every
17       pack that he smoked.
18            He's 100 percent responsible for the choices
19       he made.
20            Mr. Cavalier's knowledge about the dangers of
21       smoking, plus Mr. Cavalier's power over his
22       smoking, he was the only one that had power over
23       his own smoking.  Nobody could force him to stop.
24       And Mr. Cavalier's responsibility to choose health
25       over smoking, 100 percent. The next question on the verdict form:  "What
2       is the total amount of damages sustained by Ann
3       Cavalier for the loss of her husband's
4       companionship and protection and her pain and
5       suffering as a result of the Thomas Cavalier's
6       death?
7            Any damages must be fair and just in light of
8       the evidence.  And I'm not talking about damages
9       because we are of the position that damages should
10       be awarded to the contrary.
11            I submit to you that no damages should be
12       awarded at all.  But it's incumbent upon me to
13       discuss all the questions on the verdict form, and
14       that's why I'm discussing this one.
15            Plaintiff is not entitled to recover
16       compensatory damages in the amount -- in excess of
17       the amount which represents the loss actually
18       inflicted by the action of the defendants.
19            The purpose of compensatory damage is to
20       compensate, not to punish the defendants.
21            Plaintiff is seeking damages for
22       Mrs. Cavalier's pain and suffering.  Now yesterday
23       you heard the figure tossed out of $10 million.
24       And that that might -- well, that defies common
25       sense. Plaintiff's claim does not include economic
2       damages.  Those are damages for lost wages, lost
3       financial support.
4            And this claim doesn't include anything like
5       medical expenses or funeral expenses.  There can be
6       no recovery for Mr. Cavalier's pain and suffering
7       or Donna Fanali's pain and suffering or Jeanne
8       Dupuis's pain and suffering or Cheryl Lupo's pain
9       and suffering.  None of those things are involved
10       in this case, just Mrs. Cavalier's pain and
11       suffering.
12            Again, the damages start at zero.  And the
13       plaintiff has to prove to you by the greater weight
14       of the evidence each and every dollar of damages.
15            One of the things that you will have with you,
16       that you have now, is Instruction No. 18, and it
17       talks about the credibility of witnesses.  And I
18       want to discuss that briefly with you.
19            In evaluating the believability of any
20       witness, and the weight you will give the testimony
21       of any witness, you may properly consider the
22       demeanor of the witness while testifying, the
23       frankness, or lack of frankness, of the witness,
24       and that's what I want to talk about.  The
25       frankness or lack of frankness of the witness. And I want to ask you, why weren't the
2       plaintiff's witnesses frank with you?
3            Cheryl Lupo had to be impeached four times.
4       On four occasions, Ms. Schneider had to show her a
5       deposition and said, "Well, you testified
6       differently in here in front of the jury than you
7       did in your deposition where you took the same oath
8       to tell the truth and nothing but the truth so help
9       you God."  But you said something different here.
10       Well, the truth doesn't change.  You don't have to
11       try to remember it because it does not change.  But
12       my grandmother used to say "The truth don't
13       change."  That's what she'd say.
14            Now, Jeanne Dupuis had to be impeached six
15       times.  Again, confronted with the deposition.  And
16       Mr. Gary was showing you all those pages of the
17       deposition that they -- the testimony, but
18       impeached because not consistent.
19            Donna Fanali had to be impeached 10 times,
20       including an impeachment about "Well, your father
21       didn't lie to the doctors about his quitting
22       smoking, knowing that he did quit."  Well, both of
23       those things can't be true.  You can take those
24       into account when you are evaluating what these
25       people said, what they told you. And Donna Fanali filed the lawsuit,
2       Mrs. Cavalier has been affected by dementia and
3       Alzheimer's since 2006.  The lawsuit was filed in
4       2008.  Before trial, Jeanne agreed.  Donna took it
5       upon herself, upon her own initiative to make the
6       claim.
7            Before trial, Jeanne did not know whether
8       Donna had discussed the lawsuit with their mother
9       when the lawsuit was filed.  Donna filed the
10       lawsuit after seeing an ad for the Gary firm on TV.
11            Now, plaintiff wants at least $10 million in
12       damages and it defies common sense.  They want
13       millions of dollars for concealing information from
14       Mr. Cavalier when the plaintiff and her family
15       admit that they didn't pay much attention to the
16       warnings that cigarettes could kill you, but they
17       want to recover millions of dollars without even
18       paying attention to the warnings.
19            They say no additional information would have
20       mattered to Mr. Cavalier in his smoking decisions,
21       but yet they want to recover millions of dollars
22       from R.J. Reynolds for not telling him more
23       information.
24            They want millions of dollars when no one
25       knows why Mr. Cavalier started smoking, there is no  evidence about it.  Millions of dollars when no one
2       knows what brands Mr. Cavalier smoked before 1961,
3       when he was 38 years old.  They showed you all the
4       stuff about youth smoking, a photograph at the
5       teamsters union party with the children with
6       Viceroy candy cigarettes, as if that had anything
7       to do with this case, all the stuff about youth
8       smoking and targeting youth.
9            The man is 38 years old before anybody places
10       an R.J. Reynolds product in his hand, but they want
11       millions of dollars from Reynolds.
12            Millions of dollars when Mr. Cavalier
13       continued to smoke throughout the '50s, '60s, '70s
14       and '80s at the same time millions and millions and
15       millions of other smokers were quitting.
16            Millions of dollars when no evidence
17       Mr. Cavalier relied on any advertisement or any
18       tobacco organization.  It defies common sense.
19            Millions of dollars when Mr. Cavalier's family
20       believed that he died of lung cancer until they
21       walked into court for the trial.
22            Now, they had a deposition.  These depositions
23       weren't taken years ago, they were taken last
24       summer.  They were taken in July and August of this
25       year.  And to a person they were saying well,  that -- that their father died of lung cancer.  But
2       when they got to the courthouse, all of a sudden it
3       was coronary artery disease that killed him.  Oh,
4       it's congestive heart failure that killed him.
5            Well, what happened between July and now?  You
6       said one thing in your deposition, all 700 and some
7       pages of it, talking about, well, lung cancer.  And
8       then you come in here and all of a sudden it's
9       constructive -- I mean, that it's congestive heart
10       disease -- coronary artery disease.
11            Well, the truth does not change.
12            They want millions of dollars when the
13       plaintiff admits the pack warnings on the
14       cigarettes adequately warned smokers, including
15       Mr. Cavalier, that it was adequate.  It's
16       sufficiently warned you about the dangers of
17       smoking, the adverse health effects of smoking.
18            And the peanut gallery is reminding me that
19       I've got a board here with the warnings on it.
20            Plaintiff admits the warnings were adequate as
21       a matter of law.  And plaintiff does not dispute
22       their adequacy, that they were sufficient.
23            They put the smoker on notice, give the smoker
24       the sufficient information that this was enough,
25       that you didn't have to put all of the chemicals  and everything.  The pack is so small, you can't
2       put all that on there anyway.  But the shorthand is
3       it will kill you.  The shorthand is it causes lung
4       cancer, and heart disease, emphysema, may
5       complicate pregnancy.  The shorthand quitting
6       smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your
7       health.  In shorthand, it contains carbon monoxide.
8       That's poison.  Everybody knows that.
9            You leave the engine running in your car and
10       you're in a garage or an enclosed space, it will
11       kill you.
12            What would you rather know, that it can kill
13       you or that it's -- you want the formulas with all
14       the chemicals in it?  It makes no sense at all.
15       But the warning is adequate.  That's the point.
16       The warning is adequate.
17            Millions of dollars is what they want, when
18       plaintiffs admit that any additional information
19       would not have mattered to Mr. Cavalier.  They are
20       asking for millions of dollars when plaintiff
21       admitted Mr. Cavalier loved cigarettes.  He loved
22       smoking.  He did what he loved doing, to the tune
23       of five packs a day.  And no, we're not faulting
24       him.  Nobody is in here disparaging him or casting
25       aspersions on him or engaging in an activity that  he loved.
2            What we do take issue with is someone coming
3       in and wanting compensation because the man
4       indulged in an activity that he loved doing.
5            "Please state whether you find by clear and
6       convincing evidence that punitive damages are
7       warranted."  No.
8            The judge will instruct you that if you find
9       punitive damages are warranted, you will return for
10       a second phase of trial which we will anticipate --
11       we anticipate will take a day or two.  I submit to
12       you, you answer "no," and it's over.
13            The burden of proof on the other issues in the
14       case, it's been by the greater weight of the
15       evidence.  You heard us talking about greater
16       weight of the evidence.
17            Well, in order to get punitive damages,
18       entitlement to punitive damages, the plaintiff has
19       to prove to you by clear and convincing evidence,
20       and that's a different standard, it's a much higher
21       standard, it's not beyond a reasonable doubt, but
22       it's much higher than greater weight of the
23       evidence -- much higher than greater weight of the
24       evidence.  The law will provide us some direction
25       on that. Now punitive damages can be awarded only for
2       concealment and agreement to conceal information
3       that was a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's death.
4       Information that but for the concealment of that
5       information, the omission of that information,
6       Mr. Cavalier would have quit smoking and not
7       died -- not died of a smoking-related disease.
8            You may not punish Reynolds for any harm
9       suffered by anyone other than Mr. Cavalier.  And
10       you heard time and again about all the people who
11       are dying across the country from smoking-related
12       illnesses.  No, it doesn't have anything to do with
13       Mr. Cavalier.  This case is about Mr. Cavalier.
14            Any punitive damages awarded are in addition
15       to damages that fully compensate Mrs. Cavalier.
16       And punitive damages can be awarded only -- can be
17       awarded to Mrs. Cavalier only.  They can't be
18       awarded to the American Cancer Association, or the
19       American Lung Association or anything of that sort.
20       Whatever punitive damages are awarded, and I submit
21       to you that they should not be, can only be awarded
22       to Ann Cavalier.
23            Here is Instruction No. 15:  For purposes of
24       determining whether punitive damages are warranted,
25       you may not -- you may not consider in any way  Engle findings.  You can't consider them.  Not at
2       all.  No.  The law is you cannot consider them.
3            The Engle findings do not establish that
4       Ms. Fanali is entitled to recover punitive damages
5       on behalf of her mother.
6            In determining whether punitive damages are
7       warranted, you may also take into consideration any
8       mitigating evidence.  And mitigating evidence is
9       evidence which may demonstrate there is no need to
10       impugn -- impose punitive damages against Reynolds.
11       And I submit to you there is no need to impose
12       punitive damages against Reynolds.  And I will tell
13       you why.
14            Dr. Proctor testified that over the years,
15       that Reynolds has engaged in a number of efforts to
16       make a less hazardous cigarette.  There is no such
17       thing as a safe cigarette.
18            Question:  Now, the historical record
19       demonstrates that the tobacco companies tried to
20       make a cigarette that was less hazardous,
21       understanding there is no such thing as a safe
22       cigarette, they tried to make a cigarette that was
23       less hazardous.
24            Answer:  Many cigarettes, they used catalysts
25       in the '50s.  They used special breeding techniques  in the '60s.  They used genetic engineering.  They
2       used nicotine-free cigarettes.  They developed
3       Premier and Eclipse at Reynolds to develop a
4       cigarette that would heat, not burn tobacco.  There
5       were many.  If you listed all the genuine efforts,
6       there would be many dozens.
7            Dozens of efforts to try to make the product
8       less hazardous, recognizing that it's deadly, that
9       there is no way to make it completely safe.
10            From the '50s to the '90s, Reynolds made
11       efforts to remove known carcinogens from smoke.
12       Dr. Proctor testified to this.  They started
13       developing heat, not burn technology.  Spent a
14       billion dollars back in the '80s trying to develop
15       a less harmful cigarette.  And it failed because
16       people wouldn't buy it due to the taste.  You can't
17       make consumers buy things they don't want to buy.
18            Take the nicotine out.  That's what you heard
19       Dr. Proctor say.  Well, if they took the nicotine
20       out then it would be -- it would be safer because
21       people would smoke less of it or they wouldn't
22       smoke it and then people wouldn't use it.
23            Well, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris
24       manufactured denicotinized cigarettes.  It sold
25       poorly, or they sold poorly, and they were rejected  by consumers.
2            And Dr. Farone told you that they were
3       severely criticized by the antismoking community as
4       the most dangerous product to be put on the market
5       in the last 10 years.
6            The public health community petitioned the
7       Federal government to force Philip Morris to stop
8       advertising and selling denicotinized cigarettes.
9            Mitigating evidence.  R.J. Reynolds funded
10       $350 million in research and Dr. Proctor says it
11       would be several times that amount if you adjust it
12       for inflation.
13            The Council For Tobacco Research funded
14       projects that resulted in more than 7,000
15       peer-reviewed articles.  The Surgeon General has
16       cited CTR-funded studies, studies funded by the
17       tobacco companies, more than 600 times.
18            CTR funded research at top universities,
19       including University of Florida, University of
20       Miami, Florida State, and so on, and funded at
21       least ten Nobel Prize winners.
22            Mitigating evidence, the relationship between
23       smoking and COPD.  That was some of the research
24       that was done, established this relationship
25       between cigarette smoking and COPD.  Some of  research established the effects of cigarette
2       smoking on the impairment of lung function among
3       heavy smokers.  The effects of inhalation of
4       cigarette smoke on the risk of lung injury and
5       declining lung function.  Articles on addiction and
6       withdraw.  All of this funded by the tobacco
7       industry, and there is no evidence that the funding
8       was cut off.
9            Now, Dr. Proctor sat there on direct
10       examination in the course of a day a better part of
11       a second day and said, Oh, yeah, when they did
12       things that were critical of tobacco, that showed a
13       link between smoking and adverse health effects,
14       the funding got cut off.
15            Well, on cross-examination, he was asked about
16       each of those.  Have you seen anything where that
17       indicates that Dr. Janoff's financing was cut off?
18       No.
19            Have you seen anything to indicate
20       Dr. Lombard's funding was cut off by anything.  No.
21            You've looked at all these documents --
22       millions of pages of documents, he said.
23            Have you seen anything that Dr. Knapp's
24       founding was cut off because he published an
25       article that said that smoking was addictive back  in 1963?  No.
2            Dr. Hanes?  No.
3            Dr. Bosse?  No.
4            Have you seen anything about any scientist's
5       funding being cut off because they published
6       something that was adverse to the tobacco industry?
7       Absolutely not.
8            Dr. Farone testified about the Tobacco Working
9       Group, and he told you that it was a collaboration
10       between the federal government, the public health
11       community, and the tobacco industry.  Now, the
12       Tobacco Working Group, that's people from the
13       American Heart Association and the American Cancer
14       Society, the federal government, and people from
15       the tobacco industry.
16            They never recommended that tobacco industry
17       remove any additives or flavors or ammonia or
18       humectants -- and humectants include glycerol.
19       That keeps the tobacco moist, the same thing in
20       opening statements, you were told that, Well,
21       glycerine, that's the same thing that's in
22       antifreeze.
23            But it's not antifreeze that's in the tobacco.
24       It's just a chemical component that is similar to
25       one found in antifreeze. The Tobacco Working Group recommended that
2       companies manipulate nicotine and tar levels in
3       cigarettes.  And Dr. Farone said, yeah, well, you
4       can.  Manipulate.  It has a negative connotation.
5       Manipulate.  But what they did was they adjusted
6       the amount of nicotine in the cigarette in an
7       effort to lower the amount of -- while lowering the
8       amount of tar, recognizing that the tar is what
9       causes disease, not the nicotine, so that someone
10       smoking the cigarette would get a certain level of
11       nicotine and at the same time get less tar.  And so
12       that's what this group, government officials,
13       public health officials, people from the tobacco
14       companies, recommended that the companies
15       manipulate tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes in
16       an effort to make them less hazardous.
17            More mitigating evidence, evidence of why
18       Reynolds should not be punished.  Since 1986,
19       Reynolds has disclosed to congress the ingredients
20       and additives in its cigarettes, and since 2009,
21       Reynolds has disclosed to the Food and Drug
22       Administration its formulas for all cigarette
23       products and disclosed to the FDA all research done
24       on the ingredients and the additives.
25            Well, the bottom line is that the tobacco  industry is becoming obsolete.  Dr. Proctor told
2       you that.  Smoking is denormalized and marginalized
3       in today's society, and ever since the Surgeon
4       General's report came out in 1964, this society has
5       been marching toward that end.  Smoking rates are
6       at their lowest level since the 1920s.  The
7       cigarette is a horse and buggy technology,
8       according to Dr. Proctor.  We are in a period of
9       collapse of smoking.  Smoking is on its way out.
10       It's no longer socially acceptable.  It's
11       stigmatized to smoke.
12            And among youth, youth smoking has dropped 66
13       percent since 1966, and in all the 50 states, of
14       all the 50 states in the United States of America,
15       there's only one state that has lower rates of
16       youth smoking than Florida, and that's Utah, which
17       is heavily Mormon and the Mormons said no drinking,
18       no smoking, don't even use caffeine.  It's against
19       their religion.  Only that state has a higher --
20       has a lower rate of youth smoking than Florida.
21            Cigarettes are stigmatized.  Teenagers today
22       are more likely to smoke marijuana or drink alcohol
23       than smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is on its way out.
24       You heard all this stuff about youth marketing and
25       our selling to youngsters, references to our  children.  Well, our children are not smoking.
2       They're doing some other things, but they aren't
3       smoking.  And then if you want to take up an
4       activity, it doesn't have to be advertised.
5       There's no advertising for marijuana.  You don't
6       see any ads for marijuana, but people are using it.
7       That's because it's becoming more socially
8       acceptable.  The social forces in the country are
9       leaning in that direction, with states legalizing
10       marijuana for medicinal and recreational use.
11            The evidence demonstrates there is no need to
12       impose punitive damages.
13            In deciding whether punitive damages are
14       warranted, you may not seek to punish R.J. Reynolds
15       for any harm suffered by any individuals other than
16       Thomas Cavalier.
17            MR. ACOSTA:  Your Honor, I object to that.
18       That's a misstatement of the law.
19            THE COURT:  He's just reading from the final
20       jury instructions.
21            MR. PERSONS:  I'm reading the instructions,
22       and it's Instruction 15.  Nor may you punish
23       R.J. Reynolds for conduct that did not produce
24       harms within the state of Florida.
25            THE CLERK:  Ten minutes, Counsel. MR. PERSONS:  Thank you.
2            I thought I had turned it off.  I apologize.
3            Okay.  We talked about damages, and you
4       shouldn't even get there.  Punitive damages
5       warranted?  No.
6            There goes the clicker.  I'm almost done.  I
7       know we need a break.  You're going to get one, I'm
8       sure.
9            Summing up, Mr. Cavalier did not die from
10       coronary artery disease caused by smoking.  He died
11       from COPD.  The coronary artery disease that he did
12       have was caused by diabetes, 100 percent.
13            No evidence that Mr. Cavalier smoked R.J.
14       Reynolds cigarettes before 1961 when he was 38
15       years old.  In fact, there is no physical evidence
16       of R.J. Reynolds' product being smoked by
17       Mr. Cavalier.  All of the photographs that have
18       cigarette packs in them have Parliament cigarettes
19       in front of Mr. Cavalier.  That's a Philip Morris
20       product, not an R.J. Reynolds product.
21            We have Donna said that he smoked Kools, but
22       we don't have anything that we can look at to
23       verify or confirm that.  Donna also said on the
24       stand that, well, he bought more Kools, he bought
25       them by the carton, while he bought Parliament by  the pack; yet in all the photographs there is
2       Parliament and not Kool.  Some of the photographs
3       go back before the children were born.  Parliament,
4       not Kools.
5            Mr. Cavalier continued to smoke for decades
6       despite repeated specific warnings about the
7       dangers, starting before he ever smoked an R.J.
8       Reynolds cigarette.  Mr. Cavalier always had the
9       ability to quit but continued to smoke -- continued
10       to smoke until he was motivated to quit, and then
11       he quit in 1989.
12            Mr. Cavalier's smoking decisions were not
13       influenced by anything R.J. Reynolds said or
14       anything R.J. Reynolds did.
15            And here is Dr. Cuyler Hammond, and this was a
16       broadcast about the research.  You see, when they
17       did this research, it was big news, and so you
18       didn't have to read, you could sit in front of your
19       television or in front of your radio and get this
20       information that's coming out about the dangers,
21       the health risks of smoking.
22            Here's Dr. Cuyler Hammond talking about the
23       research he and Daniel Horn did, the
24       epidemiological studies, that demonstrated,
25       according to Dr. Cuyler Hammond, beyond a  reasonable doubt the link between smoking and lung
2       cancer.
3            Would you play it, Mr. Smith?
4  5            DR. HAMMOND:  It is now subject to my opinion
6       beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking
7       greatly increases the probability of developing
8       lung cancer.  In my opinion, people should be
9       warned of the dangers, and they are being warned.
10       What they then want to do, whether they want to
11       smoke or not, is their own business.
12            (Video clip stopped.)
13            MR. PERSONS:  And then when the Surgeon
14       General's report came out, the news covered that.
15  16            HARRY REASONER:  In this kind of a country, it
17       comes down to you, whether you like it or not.  No
18       one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is
19       now quite clear that no one is going to tell him
20       that it's good for him either.  The decision is
21       his, the decision and the health that may depend on
22       it.  This is Harry Reasoner.  Good night.
23            (Video clip stopped.)
24            MR. PERSONS:  And that's consistent with what
25       Donna Fanali told us.  Whether or not he was going  to quit was his own decision, and when he made that
2       decision, when he made up his mind he was going to
3       quit, that's when he quit.
4            I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, the
5       evidence is overwhelming that it was Mr. Cavalier's
6       fault for his smoking, and not that of anyone else.
7       Only he had control of it, and no one else should
8       be blamed for it.  And if you apply the law to the
9       facts, the evidence, based on the evidence that
10       you've heard in the courtroom, the evidence points
11       in only one direction, and that's a verdict in
12       favor of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
13            I thank you for your kind attention.
