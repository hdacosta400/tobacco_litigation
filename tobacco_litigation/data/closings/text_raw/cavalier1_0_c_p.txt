22           MR. CHESTNUT:  Good afternoon, jurors.  On
23      behalf of the entire group of plaintiffs, on behalf
24      of Mrs. Fanali, on behalf of Mrs. Cavalier -- who's
25      on the back row there, sitting back there, gorgeous lady one over from the back -- we want to
2      thank you.  It's been almost three weeks.  You've
3      been very attentive.  We just need a few more
4      minutes of your time, perhaps one more day for
5      punitive damages, to encapsulate all the evidence
6      you've heard, because you've heard so much.
7           But it all boils down to this, ladies and
8      gentlemen.  It's simple:  Lie, deny, and blame the
9      smoker.  Lie about the harmful effects of smoking,
10      deny that smoking is addictive, and blame the
11      smoker.
12           Members of the jury, this is America.  We love
13      it.  You can do anything.  You can be Jay Z.  You
14      can be Jay from around the corner.  You can be
15      Beyonc√© or you could be Bea from the beauty salon.
16      You could apply pressure, defy pressure.  It's
17      limitless.
18           But as a company, there are limitations,
19      because as a country, we have a conscience, and
20      it's that conscience that separates us from the
21      rest of the --
22           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's
23      improper, conscience of the community.
24           THE COURT:  Conscience of the community, just
25      don't reference that.  You're fine otherwise. That's fine.
2           MR. PERSONS:  Motion.  May I approach?
3           THE COURT:  Okay.  Sure.  Of course,
4      Mr. Persons.
5 before the
6 Court at the bench and out of the hearing of the jury.)
7           MR. PERSONS:  This will save some time.
8           THE COURT:  That's fine.  Yes.
9           MR. PERSONS:  What I'd like to do so that I
10      don't have to jump up here every time is when --
11           MR. GARY:  You don't have to scream the
12      objection.
13           THE COURT:  We're fine.
14           MR. PERSONS:  Well, instead of having to come
15      up here and move for a mistrial, which is what I'm
16      going to do now, I will simply say "motion."
17           THE COURT:  Okay.
18           MR. PERSONS:  That way I don't have to come up
19      here and do this.
20           THE COURT:  Okay.  That's fine.  Okay.  That's
21      fine.  Is that acceptable to the plaintiff?
22           MR. CHESTNUT:  That's great.
23           MR. GARY:  Yeah, that's good.
24           MR. PERSONS:  And of course I'll move --
25           THE COURT:  At this point, I'm going to deny it, but I'll sustain your objection.
2           MR. PERSONS:  Thank you.
3 in open
4 court before the Court and jury.)
5           MR. CHESTNUT:  Members of the jury, the rules
6      for a company are simple.  You can make all the
7      money you want to make, a million, a billion, $10,
8      but you cannot sacrifice the safety of Americans
9      for profit.
10           A tobacco company, including RJR, must not
11      intentionally produce a defective cigarette knowing
12      that the toxin, the chemical compound in this
13      cigarette, is toxic to humans and is likely to
14      cause deadly disease in the Americans that purchase
15      that cigarette.
16           MR. PERSONS:  Objection; preemption.
17           THE COURT:  Overruled.
18           MR. CHESTNUT:  An industry, the tobacco
19      industry, must not conspire amongst itself, plot to
20      intentionally conceal from the American government
21      and the American public the harmful effects of the
22      cigarettes they sell and the addictive nature of
23      the cigarettes that they sell.
24           Members of the jury, we're going to go through
25      some evidence, and as we do that, I'd just ask you do one thing for me, and that is, remember that the
2      reality of Mr. Cavalier is different.  The reality
3      of this case is different.
4           This case is really set in the 1930s and '40s.
5      When Mr. Cavalier was a teenager and was targeted
6      by the tobacco companies, there wasn't the
7      organization called Truth.  Teenagers didn't know
8      about the harmful and deadly effects of smoking.
9      In fact, tobacco companies were advertising that
10      smoking was not only safe, it was healthy.
11           Mr. Cavalier's reality in the 1930s and '40s,
12      and '50s, the reality of the public in the 1930s
13      and '40s and '50s, was wholly diametrically opposed
14      to what we know today, and that was by design,
15      because the tobacco company conspired, the tobacco
16      industry conspired, to lie, deny, and blame the
17      smoker.
18           Let's go to 1955, ladies and gentlemen.  The
19      Plaza Hotel, a group of tobacco executives get
20      together.  They're meeting about the future of
21      their industry.  They're meeting to plan on lie,
22      deny, and blame the smoker.
23           Here's a document, ladies and gentlemen.  It
24      says:  For nearly 20 years, this industry has
25      employed a single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts:  litigation, politics, and
2      public opinion.  It has always been a holding
3      strategy consisting of creating doubt about the
4      health charge without actually denying it --
5      they're talking about smoking -- advocating the
6      public's right to smoke without actually urging
7      them to take up the practice.  On the litigation
8      front, for which this strategy was designed, it has
9      been successful.
10           What are they conspiring to do, ladies and
11      gentlemen?  They are conspiring to make billions of
12      dollars selling a drug.  They say the future, the
13      future, we have an emerging picture of a fast,
14      highly pharmacological, effective and cheap drug --
15      this is their internal document, ladies and
16      gentlemen -- drug called tobacco.
17           Now, why is it so important for them to lie
18      and deny the addictive nature of tobacco?  We'll
19      get to it in some slides later.
20           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Objection, Your Honor.  May we
21      approach?  Can you pull that down, please?
22           THE COURT:  Sure, Ms. Schneider.
23           MS. SCHNEIDER:  That is not in evidence.
24           THE COURT:  Mr. Acosta didn't put that in
25      evidence. CHESTNUT:  I think he's moving it into
2      evidence.
3           THE COURT:  Is it coming in?
4           MS. SCHNEIDER:  We still have argument on it,
5      Your Honor.
6           THE COURT:  That's denied.  Let's go.
7           Defendant's objection is denied.  Let's go.
8 in
9 open court before the Court and jury.)
10           MR. CHESTNUT:  Before starting on the future
11      scenario let us look at what we are currently
12      selling and how it is developed.
13           "A cigarette as a drug administration system
14      for public use has a very, very significant
15      advantage."
16           Here's, in essence, what they're trying to
17      say, ladies and gentlemen.  I'll sum it up for you.
18           MR. PERSONS:  Object to the interpretation of
19      the document.
20           THE COURT:  Overruled.
21           MR. CHESTNUT:  It's argument.
22           THE COURT:  Overruled.
23           MR. CHESTNUT:  Thank you.
24           The cigarette companies are selling a drug.
25      The drug is nicotine.  In America, the Government regulates drugs as either illegal or legal.  You're
2      either in the illegal drug trade or you're in the
3      legal drug trade.
4           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
5           THE COURT:  Overruled.
6           MR. CHESTNUT:  If you're in the illegal drug
7      trade, if you get caught, you're going to jail.  If
8      you're in the legal drug trade, ladies and
9      gentlemen, you are regulated by the FDA.  And that,
10      ladies and gentlemen, is what they were trying to
11      avoid.
12           The tobacco companies, although they're
13      selling nicotine, they know it's addictive, they
14      know it's going to freebase.  It's addictive as
15      crack.  Freebase is what Pookie did in New Jack
16      City.
17           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
18           THE COURT:  Overruled.
19           MR. CHESTNUT:  It's freebase.  It's a drug.
20      Drugs that are this strong, as strong as nicotine,
21      are regulated by the Federal Drug Administration.
22      They don't want the Government regulation, and so
23      they conceal it.  Not only do they conceal it, they
24      conspired to conceal it by putting it in tobacco
25      seeds. It says:  "Tobacco is a relatively efficient
2      nicotine delivery system."
3           This is their documents, not me, it's them.
4           "The effect of nicotine on the brain is to
5      increase the level of arousal.  Different people
6      smoke cigarettes for different reasons, but the
7      primary reason is to deliver nicotine into their
8      bodies.  Similar organic" -- this is them comparing
9      the drug they're selling to other drugs.
10           They say:  "Similar organic chemicals include
11      nicotine, quinine, cocaine, atropine and morphine.
12      While each of these substances can be used to
13      affect human physiology, nicotine has a
14      particularly broad range of influence."
15           A cigarette --
16           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, take that down,
17      please.  May we approach?
18           THE COURT:  That's fine.
19           Objection sustained; the bottom portion of
20      that document.  I saw it.  Just the bottom portion.
21      Objection sustained.
22           Just crop the bottom portion.  Thank you.
23           MR. CHESTNUT:  Thank you.
24           It's a tobacco document, internal, ladies and
25      gentlemen, says:  "A cigarette is the perfect pleasure.  It is exquisite, and it leaves one
2      unsatisfied."
3           This starts talking about addiction.
4           "What more can one want?  Let us provide the
5      exquisiteness and hope that they," meaning the
6      American public --
7           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
8           THE COURT:  Overruled.
9           MR. CHESTNUT:  -- the American public, "that
10      they, our consumers, continue to remain
11      unsatisfied" because, members of the jury, the more
12      you remain unsatisfied, the more cigarettes you
13      buy.  Kind of like when you buy four to six packs a
14      day for 50 years like Thomas Cavalier, the more
15      you're unsatisfied, the more you buy.
16           "The attitude of men must directly deal with
17      the industry is that's what's interesting and
18      important for us to understand, that is why the
19      notes of our four interviews and research are given
20      at some length."
21           Here's where we get into addiction.
22           One of the men, these are tobacco employees
23      and execs saying, one of the men said, "It's
24      fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they,"
25      meaning the American public, "cannot break." Another one said, "Boy, wouldn't it be
2      wonderful if our company was the first to produce a
3      cancer-free cigarette?  What could we do to the
4      competition?"
5           Members of the jury, all this time we're
6      spending arguing about causation, they knew as an
7      industry way, way back, as my grandma would say,
8      way back yonder, that this causes cancer.  They're
9      thinking about how can we produce a cancer-free
10      cigarette.  They didn't do it.
11           Suppose everybody smoked just one cigarette
12      less a day.  That would be maybe $40 billion a
13      year.
14           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
15      Misstates the evidence.
16           THE COURT:  Overruled.
17           MR. CHESTNUT:  Suppose everybody smoked just
18      one cigarette less a day.  That would maybe be $40
19      billion a year.
20           MR. PERSONS:  Same objection.
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.
22           MR. CHESTNUT:  The smokers seeks the
23      subjective state that results from the introduction
24      of nicotine into the bloodstream.
25           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, may we approach? COURT:  Sure.
2 before the
3 Court at the bench and out of the hearing of the jury.)
4           MS. SCHNEIDER:  This is not in evidence.
5      It's not part of the conspiracy.  It's hearsay.
6           THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Chestnut, it's a PM
7      document.
8           Mr. Acosta?
9           MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor, this goes to prove
10      conspiracy.
11           THE COURT:  Wait, wait.
12           MS. SCHNEIDER:  You only use what's in
13      evidence in closing.
14           THE COURT:  Was there any objection to this
15      one?
16           MR. ACOSTA:  Which one is this?
17           MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor, I'll move on.
18           THE COURT:  He'll move on, okay.
19 in open
20 court before the Court and jury.)
21           THE COURT:  You may continue, Mr. Chestnut.
22           MR. CHESTNUT:  Remember, ladies and gentlemen,
23      these are tobacco documents.  Tobacco documents,
24      not documents we made up, these are documents that
25      the tobacco companies hid and concealed as part of the conspiracy.  They never thought that you would
2      see it.  They never thought the public would see
3      these internal documents.
4           And so on a lot of them, you'll see this,
5      "Confidential."  Now, the themes, I'm going to go
6      through the slides, members of the jury, and if
7      you'll just go with me, all right.  Watch the
8      themes.
9           The first theme is this.  Tobacco, when you
10      see a confidential document, they admit, you'll see
11      an admission in that document that tobacco is
12      harmful and that it's addictive.  When you see a
13      public document or a document that is for release,
14      it will say the opposite, that tobacco is not
15      harmful, that it is not addictive.
16           "We must in the near future provide some
17      answers which will give smokers a psychological
18      crutch and a self-rationale to continue smoking."
19           Members of the jury, this is an ad from the
20      '40s and '50s where they have doctors and
21      advertising that doctors smoke.  More doctors smoke
22      Camels than any other cigarette.  So what tobacco
23      is telling the public, that their product must be
24      safe, it must not be addictive because doctors are
25      smoking it, but they know the opposite. You can count on cigarette companies who have
2      obligated themselves to pour millions of dollars
3      into cancer research to take anything out of your
4      cigarette that is a health hazard.  If our science
5      ever really finds any such hazard in the wonderful
6      tobacco leaf -- this is a public document.  Go back
7      to the private document.
8           "It has been our holding strategy to create
9      doubt about the health charge without actually
10      denying it."
11           They don't admit anything.  They just say, if
12      we find that it is harmful, we'll do something
13      about it.  That's not true.  It's a lie.  Lie,
14      deny, blame the smoker.
15           Here, ladies and gentlemen, the tobacco
16      companies take on the Surgeon General's report.
17      Clearly, the report issued by the Surgeon General's
18      office today is politically rather than
19      scientifically motivated.
20           Now, is this d√©j√† vu or what, because
21      yesterday when Dr. W flew all the way from Santa
22      Monica --
23           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
24           MR. CHESTNUT:  He's a witness who testified.
25      They hired him. PERSONS:  Objection.
2           THE COURT:  Overruled.
3           MR. CHESTNUT:  Thank you.
4           So he flew all the way from Santa Monica,
5      California.  He was the guy that testified in two
6      tobacco trials the same day for tobacco.
7           When I asked him -- remember he said, "I
8      graduated from Yale in 1977."
9           When we asked him about the Surgeon General's
10      report, he said, "I don't rely on the Surgeon
11      General report.  That's not authoritative."
12           But, ladies and gentlemen, you know what's
13      ironic about it?  He testified, "That's a political
14      question.  That's not a scientific medical
15      question.  I don't rely on the Surgeon General.
16      They don't know what they're talking about."
17           Members of the jury, guess what?  The Surgeon
18      General in the United States of America graduated
19      from guess where?  Yale medical school, the school
20      he was so proud of graduating from.
21           "After years of well-funded research, it has
22      not been established that cigarette smoking
23      produces a physical dependence on nicotine."
24           This is a public document.  They're denying
25      that it's addictive.  Meanwhile, inside company, they're trying to figure out how to make
2      it more addictive.  Remember, we just read a
3      document, isn't it great that people don't know.
4      We're happy they're unsatisfied because they're
5      going to buy more cigarettes.
6           The claim that there is a physical dependence
7      for smoking is simply a desperate attempt to find
8      some way to differentiate smoking from other
9      habits.  This is a public document.  Habit.  The
10      internal confidential documents will mainly say
11      addiction.
12           The Surgeon General has repeatedly stated that
13      his goal is a smokeless society, that he believes
14      smoking is one of the most addictive drugs in
15      society, and he has voiced his support of persons
16      suing tobacco companies.  Consequently, it is not
17      reasonable to expect that a report coming from his
18      office would be objective in its view on the
19      subject of cigarette smoking behavior.  This is an
20      internal document.  They're taking on the Surgeon
21      General of the United States of America and
22      basically calling him a politically motivated liar.
23           We have the responsibility of guiding a
24      research program through which a tobacco industry
25      research committee already has provided $2.2 million in 1957, $2.2 million, for grants to
2      independent scientists working in the field of
3      cancer and other challenges of human survival.
4           The research, thus far, has produced no
5      evidence that cigarette smoking or other tobacco
6      use contributes to the origin of lung cancer.  Many
7      experiments on inhalation of cigarette smoke in
8      animals have failed to produce a single cancer
9      similar to the most prevalent type of lung cancer
10      in humans.
11           Ladies and gentlemen, this is Phase II of the
12      conspiracy.  They went to universities.  They
13      commissioned committees.  $2.2 million in 1957.
14      They were paying.  They gave $2.2 million in
15      grants.  They said "independent scientists."  We're
16      going to get to slides later; but, ladies and
17      gentlemen, you'll see another theme amongst these
18      tobacco companies, when these committees that they
19      commissioned for research, some of them are
20      universities, some of them are independent, when
21      they produce or find, make factual findings, that
22      tobacco is addictive or is harmful, they terminate
23      the grant.
24           Here's a confidential letter.  There are
25      biologically active materials present in cigarette tobacco.  These are cancer-causing,
2      cancer-promoting, poisonous, stimulating,
3      pleasurable and flavorful.
4           Members of the jury, 1957, they just said
5      there is no evidence that cigarette smoking or
6      other tobacco use contributes to the origin of lung
7      cancer.  And here we go, Mr. Little here
8      confidentially saying it can cause cancer, promote
9      cancer --
10           MR. PERSONS:  Objection to that.
11           MR. CHESTNUT:  We're moving on, Your Honor.
12           The Tobacco Institute, one of these
13      committees, claims that cigarettes -- "The claims
14      that cigarettes are addictive is irresponsible and
15      are scare tactics."
16           Again, this is a public document.  And so
17      they're saying to the public, this Tobacco
18      Institute is telling the public, hey, the fact that
19      these claims that cigarettes are addictive are
20      scare tactics.  Let's look at what they're saying
21      amongst themselves.
22           Sorry.  This is another public document.  Here
23      we go.  It's part of their strategy, ladies and
24      gentlemen.  Advocate the public's right to smoke
25      without actually urging them to take up practice, but create doubt about the health charge
2      without actually denying it.  This is their
3      strategy.  This is their conspiracy.  This is their
4      document.
5           Here's another example of the committee.
6      Ladies and gentlemen, "The executive committee has
7      letters of agreement to get journalism school
8      studies of communication materials underway and
9      have been negotiated with Michigan State
10      University, University of Georgia and University of
11      Texas.  The letters of agreement include
12      confidentiality safeguards as discussed at our
13      meeting."
14           They have a confidentiality clause.  So
15      they're giving money to the schools.  They're
16      commissioning these communication materials about
17      smoking, telling the public they're safe, but
18      there's a confidentiality clause; meaning, if one
19      of these, Michigan State University, University of
20      Georgia, University of Texas, discovers that
21      tobacco is harmful or addictive, there's a
22      confidentiality clause preventing them from, what,
23      telling the public the truth.  Lie, deny, blame the
24      smoker.
25           Here's a document.  This is CTR.  It's tobacco industry research that says, "Someone could attempt
2      to make a point regarding CTR that when research by
3      its grantees appear to be" --
4           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, may we approach?
5      Take that down, please.
6           THE COURT:  Sure.
7           MR. CHESTNUT:  I'll move on.
8           THE COURT:  Mr. Chestnut will take it down and
9      won't discuss it.  We'll move to the next document.
10      Not a problem.
11           MR. CHESTNUT:  Let's go to the next one.
12      Thank you.
13           Here's the Tobacco Institute.  "Our basic
14      position in the cigarette controversy is subject to
15      the charge, and may be subject to a finding, that
16      we are making false or misleading statements to
17      promote the sale of cigarettes."
18           This is a confidential document so they're
19      admitting that there is a controversy.  They're
20      worried that the truth may come out.  They're
21      making false or misleading statements to promote
22      the sale of cigarettes, ladies and gentlemen.
23      They're putting profit over the safety of the
24      American public.
25           This is a tobacco document, ladies and gentlemen, the Tobacco Institute incorporated.
2      That's the conspiracy of all the companies, that's
3      part of what we have to prove.
4           An admission by the industry that excessive
5      cigarette smoking is bad for you is tantamount to
6      an admission of guilt with regard to the lung
7      cancer problem.  This could open the door to legal
8      suits in which the industry would have no defense.
9           So we've been through lie about the harmful
10      effects, through their documents, we've established
11      deny the addictive nature.  This is the beginning
12      of the theme, blame the smoker, ladies and
13      gentlemen.
14           If we admit that excessive smoking is bad for
15      you, it's tantamount to an admission of guilt.  To
16      suggest that coping techniques are not of his own
17      choosing and are predetermined certainly does not
18      constitute good faith on the part of the industry
19      toward its consumers.
20           Ladies and gentlemen, that's a convoluted way
21      of saying these cigarettes are addictive.  They're
22      addictive, choice, from their document way back.
23           So, ladies and gentlemen, all these arguments
24      we've been hearing for the last three weeks about
25      it was Mr. Cavalier's choice, it was Mr. Cavalier's choice, it was never his choice.  It was never
2      America's choice.  You know whose choice it was?
3      Tobacco.
4           You know what they chose?  Money over the
5      safety of the American public.  They chose to lie
6      to the American public.  They chose to deny the
7      truth to the American public.  They chose to blame
8      the public for becoming susceptible to the very
9      marketing they're spending millions of dollars
10      trying to convince the public.  And then they throw
11      it back on the public for smoking their product.
12           Again, ladies and gentlemen, they admit, their
13      own document, 20 years, this was their strategy.
14      Three major fronts:  Litigation, politics, public
15      opinion.  Public opinion.  It's a smoker's choice.
16      They choose to smoke.  Smoking isn't addictive.
17      It's not a chemical.  Nicotine doesn't affect your
18      brain.  There's no freebase.  It's a choice.  It's
19      willpower.  You can't stop smoking, you're weak.
20      That's not what they think, but that's what they
21      tell the public.
22           Let's talk about addiction.  Addiction is a
23      chronic relapsing brain disease.  Did they know?
24      So the irony in this, it's 2015.  One of the major
25      issues in this litigation -- MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, may we approach?
2      Take it down, please.
3           THE CLERK:  You have 20 minutes.
4           MR. CHESTNUT:  20 minutes still.
5           Your Honor, I'll just move on.  That's fine.
6           THE COURT:  He's going to move on.  We're
7      good.
8           MR. CHESTNUT:  One of the major issues we've
9      been arguing about is addiction.  Ladies and
10      gentlemen, we're going to see a number of documents
11      that say, what, the tobacco companies, plural, not
12      only conspired to addiction, but they knew the
13      cigarettes were addictive way back.
14           Cigarette smoking is more addictive than using
15      heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people, whoever
16      smoked.  But we just spent the whole morning
17      listening to a hired expert telling all of us that
18      Mr. Cavalier is not addicted, that it's his choice,
19      that he was weak because he chose to smoke.
20           But their own people say, hooking two-thirds
21      of people, whoever smoke, we can't defend continued
22      smoking as free choice if the person was addicted.
23      This is their document.  This is their theory in
24      this case.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  Attacks the defense of the case.  Motion.
2           THE COURT:  It's from the document.
3      Overruled.
4           MR. CHESTNUT:  It's fortunate for us that
5      cigarettes are a habit the public can't break.
6           Although more people talk about taste, it's
7      likely a greater number smoke for the narcotic
8      value that comes from the nicotine, addiction.
9           Ladies and gentlemen, a cigarette -- in 1969,
10      a cigarette will even preempt food in times of
11      scarcity on the smokers priority list.
12           Ladies and gentlemen, this is important,
13      because in 1969, they're saying that a cigarette
14      will preempt food in times of scarcity on the
15      smokers priority list.
16           Well, let's -- let's think about
17      Mr. Cavalier's priority list.  Think about the
18      testimony we heard from the Cavalier family.
19           MR. PERSONS:  Objection to that one.
20           THE COURT:  Sure.
21           MR. CHESTNUT:  I'll move on.
22           THE COURT:  He'll move on.  He'll move on.
23           MR. PERSONS:  I need a ruling on it.
24           THE COURT:  Yes.
25           MR. PERSONS:  And there's -- MS. SCHNEIDER:  Objection to this one, too.
2           MR. PERSONS:  And there's a number of them
3      like that, and they're not even on the plaintiffs'
4      exhibit list, so when we move, they take it down.
5           THE COURT:  He's okay.
6           MR. CHESTNUT:  I'll tell you what --
7           THE COURT:  He'll move on.  That's fine.  He's
8      okay.  We're good.  We're good.  We'll move on.
9           MR. CHESTNUT:  We've seen enough tobacco
10      documents today.
11           So what is it really, ladies and gentlemen,
12      that this case is about?  A lot of this has to do
13      with credibility.
14           And so I just want to plant some things in
15      your mind so you can think about it as you hear our
16      closing arguments.
17           Now, first and foremost, we have the burden of
18      proof, we do, the greater weight of the evidence.
19      We're the plaintiffs.
20           Members of the jury, we presented you with
21      over two weeks of evidence.  They did one day.
22           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
23           THE COURT:  Overruled.
24           MR. CHESTNUT:  Members of the jury, you will
25      hear in the defense closing a lot of different theories about causation, because there's some
2      things that you're going to have to determine.
3      Here's what I submit to you that this comes -- this
4      case comes down to this regarding Mr. Cavalier.
5      "A" versus "the."  Two words, ladies and gentlemen,
6      that's what the case is about, "a" versus "the."
7           Let's take a look at -- now yesterday we heard
8      from Dr. W let's call him.  And the doctor's
9      primary contention was that COPD was the cause of
10      smoking.  And he and I got into this big kind of
11      spar over "a" versus "the."  And ultimately he had
12      to conclude that cigarette smoking is "a" cause of
13      cardiovascular disease and that cardiovascular
14      disease is "a" cause of death from smoking.
15           So let's look at the difference between "a,"
16      ladies and gentlemen, and "the."
17           The word "a" or letter, is an indefinite
18      article.  So it's not particular or certain of one
19      class or a group.  It's "a."
20           So if Mr. Cavalier has COPD, cardiovascular
21      disease, diabetes, and lung cancer, all we have to
22      prove is that cardiovascular disease is "a,"
23      indefinite, one of, one of the causes of his death.
24           What the defense will submit to you is that it
25      is "the" cause.  They're going to submit to you -- they're going to argue to you, ladies and
2      gentlemen, that cardiovascular disease is "the"
3      cause of death, which is why they've made such a
4      huge deal out of the death certificate when they
5      say that COPD is "the" only cause of death.  We'll
6      get to the death certificate.
7           "The" is distinct from "a."  "The" is a
8      definite article used especially before a noun,
9      with a specifying or particularized effect, as
10      opposed to the indefinite or generalized force of
11      the indefinite article "a."  So "a" is the opposite
12      of "the."
13           Why is that important for us, ladies and
14      gentlemen, "a" versus "the"?
15           We, as the plaintiffs, the Court will instruct
16      you, here's the first question you will have to
17      answer on your verdict form.
18           Was smoking cigarettes "a" not "the," a legal
19      cause of Mr. Cavalier's coronary artery disease?
20      And, if so, was coronary artery disease "a" legal
21      cause of his death, not "the" legal cause of his
22      death.  It has to be "a" legal cause of his death.
23           So whether COPD was a contributing factor,
24      whether diabetes was a contributing factor, whether
25      the lung cancer was a contributing factor, he had cardiovascular disease.  It is one of the causes
2      legally of his death.
3           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.  Misstates the law,
4      Your Honor.
5           THE COURT:  Overruled.
6           MR. CHESTNUT:  That is our verdict.  I submit
7      to you we'll make it.  And it's in the jury
8      instruction as well.  And I don't want to go
9      through it.  But I'll just highlight it very
10      quickly, ladies and gentlemen, that even in the
11      jury instructions -- and I want to go through this
12      with you because it's important.
13           Because it says, "In order to be regarded as a
14      legal cause of coronary artery disease, cigarette
15      smoking need not be the only cause."  This is the
16      jury instruction.  Instruction 5, in order to be
17      regarded as a legal cause cigarette smoking does
18      not have to be the only cause.  Smoking cigarettes
19      may be a legal cause of coronary artery disease
20      even though it operates in, what, combination with
21      some other cause if smoking cigarettes contributes
22      substantially to producing coronary artery disease.
23           Let me go a little further.  Coronary artery
24      disease is a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's death if
25      it directly and in a natural and continuous sequence produced or contributed substantially to
2      producing such death so that it can be said but for
3      the coronary artery disease, the death would not
4      have occurred.
5           Now, this is very important because this will
6      make you think, wait now, wait now, it says but for
7      the coronary artery disease, the death would not
8      have occurred.  In other words, plaintiffs must
9      prove that but for the coronary artery disease, he
10      would not have died.  That's an important
11      paragraph.
12           You're going to hear a lot of argument on
13      that.  But I just submit to you, let's read the
14      next paragraph that qualifies this one.  The next
15      paragraph says, "In order to be regarded as a legal
16      cause of death, coronary artery disease need not be
17      the only cause.  Coronary artery disease may be a
18      legal cause of death, even though it operates in
19      combination with some other cause if coronary
20      artery disease contributes substantially to the
21      death."
22           That's the jury instruction, ladies and
23      gentlemen.  It's just got to be one of them.  It
24      doesn't have to be the only one.
25           That's what the argument has been about death certificate.  Before we get to the death
2      certificate, can we go to 508157?
3           So was Mr. Cavalier diagnosed with coronary
4      artery disease?  William Ludwig, December 7th,
5      1990, writing to Dr. Cowen.  Thank you very much
6      for the privilege of seeing Mr. Cavalier again --
7      then exchange of pleasantries.  Can we go down to
8      the bottom?
9           Clinical impressions:  Evidence of
10      atherosclerotic heart disease and underlying
11      myocardial dysfunction.  He's got heart dysfunction
12      and evidence of atherosclerotic heart disease.
13           Now, you remember yesterday, I'll get to it a
14      little later, but Dr. W came in, and he was arguing
15      down that heart disease -- or that COPD was the
16      only cause of death.
17           But, ladies and gentlemen, dyspnea is a
18      shortness of breath.  It says it's probably
19      multifactorial, which means there are many causes,
20      COPD, heart disease, and myocardial dysfunction.
21           Now, according to the jury instruction we just
22      read and the verdict form that you'll receive,
23      that's sufficient for us to prevail and go to Phase
24      II.
25           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.  That is a gross misstatement of the law --
2           THE COURT:  Sustained.
3           MR. PERSONS:  And move --
4           MR. HOHNBAUM:  -- and move to strike it.
5           THE COURT:  Denied.
6           MR. CHESTNUT:  We submit to you that this is
7      evidence to prove that Mr. Cavalier had heart
8      disease diagnosed in 1990.  The doctor admitted
9      yesterday that there is no other medical record
10      demonstrating that Mr. Cavalier had or was
11      diagnosed with heart disease prior to 1990.  That's
12      important, because there's a Statute of
13      Limitations.  So he has to be diagnosed with this
14      after 1990.  This is 12/7/1990, first document,
15      first doctor to diagnose it.
16           And moreover -- can we go back up top?
17      Because there's going to be argument about, well,
18      we don't have all the medical records, a lot of the
19      medical records are missing.
20           But you know, this doctor says a lot for us.
21      Because he says that this is a consultation
22      follow-up, which means Dr. Cowen referred Mr.
23      Cavalier to Dr. Ludwig for a consultation, which
24      means he's sending him to the -- to this doctor for
25      an evaluation of what's wrong with his heart. This is further evidence that this is the
2      diagnosis, that there's no prior treatment for the
3      heart, no prior diagnosis of heart conditions.
4           THE CLERK:  Counsel, you have 10 minutes.
5           MR. CHESTNUT:  Thank you, ma'am.
6           Let's go to the -- so the next question is:
7      Was Mr. -- can we go to Cavalier 33?
8           Was Mr. Cavalier addicted?  Now, we just heard
9      testimony about that, right?  How about let's start
10      out -- now, Dr. -- Dr. Feingold came in.  We
11      brought him in.  He testified to you that there are
12      basically two ways of determining addiction.
13           But before we get into the complex cases on
14      addiction, let's just go to common sense, ladies
15      and gentlemen.
16           Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
17      testimony -- you've seen documentation that
18      Mr. Cavalier smoked four to six packs a day.  So
19      that's over a 100 cigarettes a day for 50 years.  A
20      100 packs a day, 50 years, and that he tried
21      multiple times to quit, and he was never able to
22      quit.
23           And his daughter testified that the last
24      couple days of his life he was on oxygen, and
25      that's why he stopped smoking.  So common sense says he was addicted.  Can we go to Dr. Feingold?
2      You ready?
3           So here's what's important about what you've
4      heard.  You've heard from Dr. Feingold.
5      Dr. Feingold diagnosed Mr. Cavalier with the --
6      with being addicted to cigarettes based off of the
7      Fagerstrom.  And he differentiated why he used this
8      test and not the DSM-5 test which was used today.
9      Why is it?
10           Well, ladies and gentlemen, here's the DSM-5
11      test.  Guess what?  You kind of need the person
12      alive to answer these questions.  "Have you had
13      unsuccessful efforts to quit?"  They didn't even
14      ask Mr. Cavalier that.  "Cravings for tobacco."
15      You need to ask Mr. Cavalier that.  "Failure to
16      attend to responsibilities or obligations due to
17      tobacco."  You've got to ask Mr. Cavalier that.
18      But he's been dead since 1993.  It's 2015.
19           Members of the jury, the Fagerstrom, which is
20      Dr. Feingold used, doesn't require that.  These are
21      objective questions.  "How soon after you wake do
22      you crave smoking?"  Well, his daughter can observe
23      that.  "Was it difficult for him to stop?"  These
24      are observations.  Well, let's just disregard all
25      of that. The basics is this:  Over a 100 cigarettes a
2      day.  There's a deposition read in for
3      Mr. Possidento yesterday that said he would buy two
4      cartons at a time and bring them to work with him
5      every night.  Two cartons.  Not the packets.  Two
6      cartons.
7           And there's an argument that he's not
8      addicted?  That's an argument that he's not
9      addicted from the same folks who have internal
10      documents saying that --
11           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
12           THE COURT:  Sustained.
13           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Me, too.
14           THE COURT:  That's okay.
15           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
16           THE COURT:  Denied.
17           MR. CHESTNUT:  So next, ladies and gentlemen,
18      let's talk about Dr. W.
19           You know, it's kind of unfortunate -- can we
20      go to the second slide?
21           So this is --
22           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Objection, Your Honor.
23           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
24           MS. SCHNEIDER:  It's not in evidence.
25           MR. CHESTNUT:  It's the -- HOHNBAUM:  We specifically excluded it.
2           MR. CHESTNUT:  It's the Surgeon General
3      Report.
4           THE COURT:  He's just using it as a
5      demonstrative.  It's not in evidence.
6           MR. CHESTNUT:  So this is the Surgeon General.
7      He went to Yale medical school.  So did Dr. W.
8      Let's talk about what the Surgeon General --
9           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
10           MR. CHESTNUT:  It's demonstrative.
11           THE COURT:  Tie it to Proctor's testimony.
12           MS. SCHNEIDER:  What?
13           MR. HOHNBAUM:  May we approach on that, Your
14      Honor?
15           THE COURT:  Sure.
16           MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor, I tell you what,
17      we'll move on.
18           MR. HOHNBAUM:  May we approach, Your Honor?
19           THE COURT:  Okay.  No, because he moved on,
20      Mr. Hohnbaum.
21           MR. HOHNBAUM:  I'll make a motion on that,
22      Your Honor.
23           THE COURT:  Denied.
24           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Thank you.
25           MR. CHESTNUT:  Can we pull this up on addiction?
2           Dr. W said he relied upon the death
3      certificate in forming his conclusions.  That's
4      what he told you yesterday.
5           Now, he also said that he taught students, he
6      teaches doctors, and that it's very important
7      that -- and he stresses this to his students, that
8      you be accurate in your diagnosis, that you verify
9      the accuracy of documents, that you read the
10      details, the devil's in the details.  This is
11      medicine.  People's lives are at stake.  They have
12      a hippocratic oath to do no harm to a patient.
13           Ladies and gentlemen, we locked him in.  He
14      said, yeah, you've got to be accurate.  Yeah, I
15      teach my students on it.  You've got to read the
16      document.
17           THE COURT:  Mr. Chestnut, five minutes.
18           MR. CHESTNUT:  Five minutes.  Okay.
19           I thought I had a pointer here.
20           Ladies and gentlemen, now we all know -- he
21      said he reviewed, he did his homework.  But he also
22      said -- actually, he did say he did his homework,
23      he said they did his PowerPoint.  But he said he
24      reviewed the documents.
25           We all know Mr. Cavalier couldn't read because he only went to the third grade.  The death
2      certificate says "12th grade."
3           Now, we're not knocking Dr. Cowen, I'm not
4      challenging Dr. Cowen.  I'm just looking at the
5      document.  And it's like an exercise of Microsoft
6      Word because there's too many fonts on this
7      document.  You've got manuscripts, Sans script,
8      Times New Roman.  I mean, so let's just look at
9      this.  So here's one signature.  Here's where
10      Dr. Cowen signs, right?
11           Now, let's go back -- wait, wait, wait.
12           Now, Dr. Cohen -- Dr. Cowen -- look at this,
13      right?  Look at that font.  That's cursive.  Then
14      he goes to print, allegedly, misspells his name.
15      Now, he's done (sic) had that since he was a kid,
16      and this is a trained doctor.  So now it's
17      C-O-H-E-N, even though up here it's C-O-W-E-N.  But
18      it's cursive here.  It's printed there.
19           Can we go down to the diagnosis?  And then
20      it's real loopy here like big P's.  Look at that
21      circle on "O."  That's totally different.  That's a
22      totally different font than before.
23           Are we knocking Dr. Cowen?  No.  Are we saying
24      he probably didn't sign this death certificate?
25      Yes.  He's a busy doctor.  How do we know? Here's a 2008 document.  Here's his signature.
2      Totally different from the signature here.  And,
3      look, even on this document they spell his name
4      right.  C-O-W-N (sic), not C-O-H-E-N.  More
5      important, here he diagnoses it as lung cancer.
6           Here's what we're saying, ladies and
7      gentlemen, Dr. W comes in and testified to a
8      reasonable degree of medical certainty that the
9      only cause of death is COPD.  And I say how did you
10      get there?  Well, I'm relying on the death
11      certificate.
12           Well, we can agree there are inaccuracies on
13      the death certificate.  We say, "well, I'm relying
14      on Dr. Cowen."  Dr. Cowen is relying on Dr. Cowen.
15           In 1993, he says "COPD."  In 2008, he says
16      "lung cancer."  We're not saying either one of them
17      are wrong.  What are we saying?  Both of them will
18      what, "a" cause, not "the," "a" cause.
19      Cardiovascular disease is a cause.
20           Now, there are lines here that could have been
21      filled out.  They could have put lung cancer here.
22      They could have put cardiovascular disease here.
23      They didn't.  The document is inaccurate.  So you
24      can't rely just on this death certificate as a
25      cause of death. But you know what we can rely on is the
2      medical records.  So Dr. W kept saying well, the
3      medical records said he was getting better, he was
4      getting better, he was getting better.  I said,
5      okay, no problem.  Show us one medical record
6      saying that.  Show us one medical record the last
7      two weeks he was in -- that Mr. Cavalier was in the
8      hospital showing that he got better.  He didn't
9      show us one.
10           You know why, ladies and gentlemen?  Because
11      there isn't one.  He didn't show us one medical
12      record for the last two weeks that said -- of Mr.
13      Cavalier's life, that mentioned COPD.  You know
14      why?  Because there wasn't one, and there isn't
15      one.
16           More importantly, ladies and gentlemen, can I
17      have 50826 -- 272?
18           So then Dr. W says well, you know, he was
19      getting better.  He was feeling better.  All right.
20      But here we have an ejection fraction of 29
21      percent.  I won't go into the diagrams on it.  But
22      if we recall, ejection fraction is -- is how much
23      capacity the heart has to pump.  And the normal --
24      Dr. Feingold told us and he showed us a graph.  A
25      normal ejection fraction is 55 percent.  Nine days before Mr. Cavalier dies, he's at 29 percent.
2      Dr. W told you, man, yeah, 29 percent, you're good.
3      Anything less than 30 percent is an industry
4      standard severe.
5           He says well, the patient was doing so good,
6      he could go back to regular life.
7           I said, okay, Doctor, no problem.  Show us one
8      record where he was discharged from the funeral
9      home?  I'm sorry.  Where he was discharged from the
10      hospital, where he was sent home since he was
11      getting better.  He wasn't sent home.  He was sent
12      to Dorsey Funeral Home nine days later.  He never
13      got better, ladies and gentlemen.
14           THE COURT:  One minute, Mr. Chestnut.
15           MR. CHESTNUT:  Thank you.
16           And there's no document or diagnosis in the
17      last nine days of Mr. Cavalier's life demonstrating
18      anything other than heart complications.
19           Now, the judge has told you about credibility
20      of witnesses, correct?  And the medical records are
21      in evidence.  You can take them back with you.
22           Here's what I want to submit to you, ladies
23      and gentlemen, there is no mention -- so they go
24      through this elaborate presentation on symptoms of
25      congestive heart failure. What isn't on there, ladies and gentlemen?
2      Ejection fraction.  These the most important, most
3      repeated symptom of congestive heart failure.  They
4      didn't leave it on there.  Because you know why?
5      Because that's what happened.  Because it
6      demonstrates that there was -- that congestive
7      heart failure was a cause of death.
8           Now I have to take my seat.  But let me just
9      share one other thing with you.
10           MR. GARY:  He can use some of my time, Your
11      Honor.
12           MR. CHESTNUT:  I want to go over the factors
13      with you, because Dr. W started talking about
14      factors of smoking, right?  So here he said these
15      are the factors of smoking:  Diabetes, family
16      history, smoking.
17           And then there was an objection to the Surgeon
18      General's report; is that correct?
19           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Yes.
20           MR. CHESTNUT:  Okay, cool.
21           So I would submit to you that there is
22      evidence out there, that there is medical evidence,
23      medical publishings, medical treatises that --
24           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Objection, Your Honor.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Objection. CHESTNUT:  I didn't say --
2           THE COURT:  Keep going.
3           MR. CHESTNUT:  I didn't say -- that relate
4      smoking to causing --
5           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Objection.
6           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.  This is
7      exactly what we addressed yesterday.
8           THE COURT:  No -- no -- no -- no speaking
9      objections.
10           MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor, I have not cited a
11      specific source.
12           THE COURT:  No, go ahead.  Mr. Chestnut, let
13      me hear -- let me hear the statement first.  Let me
14      hear the statement first.  You may continue,
15      Mr. Chestnut.
16           MR. CHESTNUT:  That there is documentation out
17      there, there are medical findings that infer that
18      diabetes can be caused by smoking.
19           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor, and move
20      to strike.
21           THE COURT:  Sustained.
22           MR. CHESTNUT:  Let's do this.  They went
23      through all these causes, right?  If you recall
24      they kind of glossed over smoking.  They did the
25      PowerPoint, but they -- HOHNBAUM:  Motion, Your Honor, on that.
2      I'm sorry.
3           THE COURT:  Okay.  Denied.
4           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Thank you.
5           MR. CHESTNUT:  They did the PowerPoint, but
6      they kind of glossed over this point of smoking.
7           And here's what's interesting.  Members of the
8      jury, they said these are Mr. Cavalier's risk
9      factors for coronary artery disease, right?  Risk
10      factors.  I don't have it on here, so I'm going to
11      show it to you on the Elmo.  And to support that,
12      they showed you a medical record.
13           Now, Mr. Cavalier, we just saw, was diagnosed
14      with cardiovascular disease in December of 1990.
15      Members of the jury, they showed you a document
16      saying -- the doctor says, "I have begged him to
17      begin exercising," from 1992.
18           So, members of the jury, they want you to
19      believe that No. 7 on their list of physical
20      inactivity is a risk factor for Mr. Cavalier's
21      coronary artery disease.  Here's the problem.  The
22      risk factor came two years after the diagnosis.
23      How can there be a risk of something you already
24      have, ladies and gentlemen?  Credibility of
25      evidence. Members of the jury, we have submitted a
2      significant amount of evidence to you.  We can
3      prove or we have proved, to a reasonable -- to --
4      to -- by a greater weight of the evidence, our
5      case.  Now, Mr. Acosta is going to come up and
6      share some additional facts, research with you, Mr.
7      Gary is going to come after that and share with you
8      documents.  We just ask your continued patience.
9           But we also ask for accountability.  Ladies
10      and gentlemen, hold both sides accountable.
11      Question the evidence.  There were a lot of
12      opinions up here, but they were based off
13      PowerPoints, a lot of records.  Our experts, they
14      had records, and their records corroborated the
15      PowerPoints that we showed you.  They taught you.
16      They took you through how they came to their
17      conclusions.  Dr. W couldn't explain how he got to
18      his conclusions because the doctor he relied on had
19      multiple findings.  Credibility of the evidence is
20      important, ladies and gentlemen, credibility of the
21      source.
22           Thank you for your attention.


25           MR. ACOSTA:  Good afternoon.  I hope you had a nice lunch.  I'm going to continue sort of where
2      Mr. Chestnut left off, with the lying and the
3      denying and the blaming.
4           You know, Mr. Cavalier was a pretty typical
5      smoker except that he smoked a lot more than most
6      smokers smoke, five to six packs a day.  But you
7      now what?  He was doing just what the cigarette
8      companies wanted him to do.
9           But the cigarette company wants you to think
10      that Mr. Cavalier knew more than they did, that he
11      should have known that they weren't telling him the
12      truth, that he should have just put down the
13      cigarettes.  But Reynolds is the one that got him
14      to do that, and he smoked their cigarettes exactly
15      the way Reynolds wanted him to smoke them.  He
16      bought a lot of cigarettes over the years and got
17      caught in a big web.  That web is a true-to-life
18      conspiracy of the tobacco companies that all made
19      an agreement to deny.
20           And the reason they did that is because if one
21      of them admitted it, one of them admitted it, the
22      cat would be out of the bag.  If that happened, the
23      others would fall.  The whole industry would have
24      fallen.
25           So they lied.  So they lied.  There really is no justification for that when it comes to human
2      life.  This is not about making a little more money
3      selling wallpaper.  This is about killing people.
4           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor;
5      inflammatory.
6           THE COURT:  Overruled.
7           MR. ACOSTA:  So I'm going to show you some
8      slides and talk a little bit, and then I'll sit
9      down and then Mr. Gary will go and he'll wrap it
10      up.
11           First thing we've got to do is we've got to
12      prove that Thomas Cavalier was a member of the
13      Engle class.  This is the definition of "class
14      members."  Class members are Florida smokers or
15      residents, which he was, who suffered or died, he
16      died, from a cigarette-related illness, which is
17      coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
18      caused by an addiction to cigarettes containing
19      nicotine.
20           That's our burden.  If we have proved that to
21      you to your satisfaction -- you're the ones that
22      decide that.  We think we've put enough evidence on
23      to prove it to you -- then you'll be answering
24      questions:  Was Thomas Cavalier addicted to RJR
25      cigarettes containing nicotine? Ms. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, that's a
2      misstatement of the --
3           MR. ACOSTA:  Well, I'm just paraphrasing.
4           THE COURT:  He's --
5           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Atherosclerotic heart disease
6      is not the disease --
7           THE COURT:  Okay.  That's fine.  Okay.  I'll
8      sustain.  That's fine.
9           MR. ACOSTA:  Well, okay.  I just put
10      atherosclerotic heart disease.  It's coronary
11      artery disease.  It's CHF.  There's a number of
12      different ways you can describe it, but it's heart
13      disease.  And then whether that was a legal cause
14      of his death.
15           A legal cause need not be the only cause.
16      That's in the instruction, and it's important
17      because there's two instructions on causation.  And
18      the second one talks about concurring cause.  A
19      legal cause is a substantial contributing cause.
20      We call that instruction the concurring cause
21      instruction, but all it means is that a legal cause
22      is a substantial contributing cause.
23           And if you think about it, there are lots of
24      situations where things combine and can cause an
25      injury or cause a death, any one of which might not be enough to cause the injury or death, but when
2      they act together, they cause the injury or death.
3      That's why we have this instruction, because it
4      permits us to show causation and prove causation
5      without having to prove but for the --
6           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
7      a misstatement.
8           THE COURT:  Sustained.
9           MR. ACOSTA:  This is the one that you can
10      follow.  A legal cause can be one of many causes.
11           Greater weight of the evidence shows Thomas
12      Cavalier died from his addiction to several
13      cigarette-related illnesses.  He had three
14      cigarette-related illnesses.  He had lung cancer,
15      he had COPD, and he had congestive heart failure
16      that backed up fluid into his lungs.
17           "Greater weight" means the more persuasive and
18      convincing force and effect of the entire evidence.
19      So when you go back into the jury room, you'll have
20      to decide, well, which side, the plaintiff -- which
21      is us -- or the defendants, had the more persuasive
22      convincing force and effect of the entire evidence,
23      the entire evidence that you've heard in the case.
24           For class members -- it's kind of cut off at
25      the top.  For class members, the findings are going to be the law, and this is the first -- the first
2      one I put up here is that nicotine in cigarettes is
3      addictive.  There is no question about that.  It's
4      been -- it's admitted and it's part of the
5      findings.
6           Reynolds placed cigarettes on the market that
7      were defective and unreasonably dangerous.  Now, if
8      you think about it, there was a warning back in
9      1970 that said cigarettes are dangerous to your
10      health.  They didn't say they were unreasonably
11      dangerous.
12           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
13      Preemption and we've got a stipulation.
14           THE COURT:  Sustained -- reference the
15      preemption then.  Sustained.
16           MR. ACOSTA:  So unreasonably dangerous is
17      something that you can't allow to happen because
18      it's unreasonable.  It's not just dangerous; it's
19      unreasonable.
20           And it dealt with, you know, an Engle trial
21      similar to this, but a lot bigger, it took a long
22      time, and in that case, much of the same
23      evidence --
24           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
25           THE COURT:  Sustained. ACOSTA:  Cigarette -- smoking cigarettes
2      causes lung cancer, and then I'm going to go
3      through these findings again just so you'll -- you
4      might see something that you hadn't seen before.
5           Lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma,
6      large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and
7      squamous cell.  Those are different kinds of lung
8      cancer; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
9      COPD; and coronary heart disease.
10           Reynolds concealed or omitted material
11      information.  This is one of the findings, and
12      it'll be binding on us -- it's binding on
13      everyone -- if he's a class member.  Reynolds
14      concealed or omitted material information not
15      otherwise known or available, knowing that the
16      material was false or misleading.
17           So that says they knew that the material that
18      they were concealing or not telling them about,
19      hiding, was important and it was false or
20      misleading or they failed to disclose a material
21      fact concerning the health effects or addictive
22      nature of smoking cigarettes or both.
23           And you have to remember, they denied that it
24      was addictive.  If you remember that Life Magazine,
25      which had the coffin nails on it, in that magazine it said cigarettes are not addictive or even
2      habit-forming.  That's what it said in that
3      magazine.
4           People -- there was a controversy created, and
5      it was created by the tobacco industry to keep
6      people smoking back then.  It was a different time.
7      You know, we sort of get locked into the way things
8      are today and what we know today and it's hard to
9      think back as to the way things were.
10           And some of you aren't as old as I am and --
11      most of you, all of you, are not as old as me --
12      and things were different.  And we tried to show
13      you some of that with some of the advertisements
14      that were on early television.
15           You know, we showed you the Flintstones,
16      Barney and Fred hiding behind a rock so that Wilma
17      and Betty won't see them smoking Winstons.  I mean,
18      that's how mundane cigarette smoking -- everybody
19      smoked then.  Everybody smoked.
20           Then Reynolds entered into an agreement to
21      conceal or omit information regarding the health
22      effects of cigarettes or the addictive nature with
23      the intention that smokers and the public would
24      rely on that information.
25           So how -- what is it that we do with corporations in this country, with companies that
2      make products?  We rely on them to tell us the
3      truth about the product.  It's common sense.  You
4      rely on a company to tell you the truth about its
5      products, not to lie to you.  And when you rely on
6      them, you buy their product.  That's what
7      Mr. Cavalier did.  Reliance is buying cigarettes
8      because that's exactly what they wanted him to do.
9           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's a
10      misstatement.
11           THE COURT:  Sustained.
12           MR. PERSONS:  Motion.
13           THE COURT:  Denied.
14           MR. ACOSTA:  Reynolds was negligent.  In that
15      set of instructions, it defines "negligence."  It's
16      unreasonable conduct.  You have a duty to do things
17      right.  They were wrong.  It was unreasonable
18      conduct.
19           So let's talk about Thomas Cavalier's
20      addiction to nicotine for a minute that caused him
21      to die -- that caused him to die from those three
22      diseases.  I already mentioned that.  What they
23      did, those three diseases destroyed his ability to
24      breathe.
25           When he had lung cancer in 1989, they removed the upper lobe of one of his lungs.  It's a big
2      hunk of lung.  So what does that do?  That gives
3      you less breathing capacity because you're missing
4      part of your lung.  The injury from that cancer was
5      a reduction in his lung capacity.
6           COPD.  You heard about emphysema and the
7      cavities it causes in the lungs, so COPD reduces
8      your breathing capacity so that it makes it very
9      difficult for you to breathe.  You can breathe in,
10      but you can't get the air out.  If you can't get
11      the air out, you can't get more air in.
12           The heart disease put fluid in his lungs,
13      because his heart was weakened by his coronary
14      artery disease.  And when you weaken the heart, it
15      can't pump blood back in through your lungs.  You
16      have to get oxygen by having your heart pump blood
17      through your lungs.  It gives it oxygen, then it
18      goes back to the heart and goes out the other side.
19           But when you put fluid in the lungs and you're
20      already missing some lung and you're already
21      stricken with emphysema, the coronary artery
22      disease was the straw that broke the camel's back,
23      and that's exactly what happened to Mr. Cavalier.
24      He had this situation happen in the hospital and he
25      died. Why so much talk about the death certificate?
2      Well, there was a May 5, 1990, cutoff for COPD and
3      lung cancer.  Back when the death certificate was
4      signed and filled out, nobody thought about what
5      the impact of that would be.  You know, it was just
6      a routine event for the doctor in the doctor's
7      office.
8           You know, somebody from the funeral home comes
9      and gives him the death certificate and who signs
10      it?  Was it somebody on the staff?  Did Dr. Cowen
11      just say something like, you know, "Go look at the
12      intake form and see what he was admitted for and
13      put it on there"?  We don't know, but we know it's
14      wrong.  I put Dr. Cowen up there because it's a
15      different writing.
16           I don't want to dwell on it, but this death
17      certificate, it isn't really wrong; it just isn't
18      correct.  It isn't filled out completely.  It
19      doesn't have the other two diseases that combined
20      to cause his death.
21           All right.  Dr. Cowen testified by deposition,
22      and he testified Thomas Cavalier had evidence of
23      congestive heart failure which contributed to his
24      shortness of breath.  He said so.
25           Dr. Cowen said that congestive heart failure causes fluid to fill the lungs.  He got fluid from
2      his body into his lungs and it's not supposed to be
3      there, and then he got an infection.
4           Dr. Cowen again says Mr. Cavalier's heart
5      failure prevented his heart from getting enough
6      oxygen.  Part of his heart muscle died.  This is
7      key testimony from Dr. Cowen.
8           Dr. Cowen said:  And is there any way -- this
9      is the question:  "Is there any way to tell from
10      the medical records when there is a reference to
11      shortness of breath that the shortness of breath is
12      being caused by his congestive heart failure versus
13      his COPD?"
14           What does he say?  He says:  "It's probably a
15      combination of the two."
16           So he's admitting that his heart failure
17      combined with the COPD to cause his death.
18           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
19      Misstatement of the evidence.
20           THE COURT:  Overruled.
21           MR. ACOSTA:  Dr. Cowen -- "Doctor, was his
22      cardiomyopathy ischemic cardiomyopathy or was it
23      diabetic cardiomyopathy?"
24           Dr. Cowen said it's ischemic, different from
25      the type that's caused by diabetes. We have Dr. Feingold.  Dr. Feingold is a
2      pulmonologist down in South Florida, Miami, and you
3      can -- I mean, just think about how he testified
4      and what he said and the way he explained things.
5      Very intelligent man.  He knows how to explain
6      medicine.  He knows the medicine very well.
7           And lung doctors and heart doctors, they have
8      to work together because the lungs are part of the
9      cardiovascular testimony so that you can get oxygen
10      to the rest of your body and your brain.
11           He's asked:  "What was the primary cause of
12      Thomas Cavalier's death?"
13           He answers:  "Ischemic cardiomyopathy."
14           And that's kind of a fancy name for not enough
15      blood getting to the heart.  That's what damaged
16      his heart.  That's coronary artery disease.
17      Ischemia, he explained that when you -- the heart
18      pumps oxygenated blood out, it goes back -- some of
19      it goes back to the heart and all the little
20      arteries in your heart that give the heart muscle
21      the oxygen it needs to pump.
22           So Feingold says the same thing that Dr. Cowen
23      said, it was ischemic, which means it wasn't from
24      diabetes.
25           You've seen that a couple times now, this ejection fraction.  This is like eight days, nine
2      days before he dies; and his heart is so weak that
3      it only pumps 29 percent of what it's supposed to
4      pump.  And Dr. Feingold said anything below 30
5      means you're on the edge of death.
6           Dr. Feingold concludes:  "Cigarette smoking
7      was a major contributor to this man's congestive
8      heart failure and a major component of what caused
9      him to die.
10           So it is a substantial contributing cause.
11      That makes it a legal cause.  That makes it a legal
12      cause.
13           MR. Hohnbaum:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
14      a misstatement of the law as well.
15           THE COURT:  Sustained.
16           MR. ACOSTA:  Dr. Feingold signed this board.
17      "I certify to a reasonable degree of medical
18      certainty the following findings:
19           "Was Thomas Cavalier addicted to nicotine?
20           "Yes."
21           And I'm going to go through some of that in a
22      minute.
23           "Was Thomas Cavalier's addiction to cigarettes
24      containing nicotine a medical cause of his death?
25           "Yes. "Did Thomas Cavalier die from heart disease
2      caused by smoking?
3           "Yes."
4           That's the proof, that's the proof that makes
5      Thomas Cavalier a class member.  I mean, think
6      about it.  How could this guy not be a class
7      member?  He is a poster child for a class member.
8           And Feingold talked about the three diseases,
9      that he died from all three.
10           Thomas Cavalier was addicted to five packs a
11      day.  It's a decision.  It results in people
12      smoking more than they would otherwise.  That's
13      what addiction does, it makes you smoke more than
14      you would otherwise would have smoked.
15           "Addiction results in changes to the
16      decision-making part of the brain.
17           So it influences you.  That's what an
18      addiction is.  You know, it's not a voluntary
19      thing.  It makes physical changes in your brain.
20      You can make a choice to try to stop; but the
21      problem is, hardly anybody stops.  It's like
22      5 percent a year.
23           And when you add that up over 40 years,
24      5 percent of so many smokers, you do get 60 million
25      people that have stopped smoking; but those former smokers, if you think about it, if they were
2      regular smokers, one out of two of them died from
3      smoking.
4           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
5           THE COURT:  Overruled.
6           MR. ACOSTA:  And that's even though they quit.
7           This is Feingold from his testimony:  "So,
8      yes, people who have a smoking rate of 100
9      cigarettes a day are addicted.  There are no other
10      possible explanations to a reasonable degree of
11      certainty without evoking some weird thing maybe
12      that I didn't think of.  But as a regular issue,
13      people who smoke five packs or four packs or three
14      packs of cigarettes a day are very addicted to
15      nicotine, because they have a change in the brain
16      and that brain change is influencing their
17      behavior."
18           Dr. Feingold testifies:  "Nicotine addiction
19      was the cause of cigarette smoking and
20      Mr. Cavalier's death was ischemic cardiomyopathy,
21      COPD, the loss of lung tissue from lung cancer, the
22      diabetes, all put together," all put together.
23           That's why we have the concurring cause
24      instruction, because all we have to show is that
25      his heart disease was a contributing cause of his death.
2           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.  Misstates the law.
3           THE COURT:  Sustained.
4           MR. ACOSTA:  Dr. Benowitz, you may remember
5      him.  I'm going to show you a little film clip, and
6      I don't know how to start that with this thing.
7           (Videotaped deposition of Dr. Benowitz played
8 as follows:)
9      Q.   Why didn't they take the nicotine out of the
10 cigarette?
11      A.   "Well, people don't smoke cigarettes without
12 nicotine.  They smoke cigarettes as a way to get
13 nicotine.  And so --"
14           "Things that are driven by these brain reward
15 centers are ones that are more powerful than your
16 logical reasoning."
17           "Without nicotine there, without addictive
18 smoking to get nicotine, there would not be
19 smoking-related cancer, heart disease, or lung disease."
20           Some people can quit pretty easily and some
21 people have great difficulty quitting and some people
22 never, ever manage to quit.
23           The pharmacologic and behavioral processes
24 that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those
25 that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and
Specialty Reporting, Inc.
941-468-2779 / nancy@specialtyreporting.com
1 cocaine.  And poly drug users, it means people who use
2 multiple drugs, and you ask them which one is the
3 hardest to quit, they will tell you that smoking is
4 harder to quit than alcohol or heroin or cocaine use.
5           Without nicotine, people would not smoke.
6 Without smoking, they would not have those diseases.
7      Q.   Why don't you tell them which factor is the
8 most important to determine if a person is addicted or
9 has a nicotine addiction or is addicted to cigarettes
10 containing nicotine?
11      A.   The most important factor is the number of
12 cigarettes smoked per day.
13      Q.   The warnings that occurred in the mid-'60s, I
14 want you to assume that most, if not all, of the
15 plaintiffs in these cases started smoking prior --
16 regular smoking prior to the 1960s.
17           Would those warnings for a person who is
18 addicted be much help?
19      A.   No.  Well, that's the stage where basically
20 attitudes and beliefs are found, so that's the stage
21 before a child begins to smoke cigarettes, but during
22 which he's exposed to cigarettes in the environment, to
23 friends who smoke, family who smoke, movies,
24 advertisements, whatever they are exposed to, they are
25 developing their -- their beliefs and their ideas about
Specialty Reporting, Inc.
941-468-2779 / nancy@specialtyreporting.com
1 smoking.
2      Q.   Prior to 1994, did they inform smokers that it
3 was an addictive drug?
4      A.   I don't believe they informed smokers that it
5 was addictive.
6      Q.   Did they mislead smokers in that regard?
7      A.   Yes, that is my opinion.  50 percent of people
8 start -- start with their first cigarette by age 15.
9      Q.   Why is that important?
10      A.   Earlier you smoke, the more highly addicted
11 you are.
12      Q.   Do you consider youth when they start smoking
13 to be informed smokers?
14      A.   No.
15      Q.   The fact that cigarette companies
16 denied that -- that nicotine was addictive, did that
17 cause people to either start smoking or continue to
18 smoke?
19      A.   Well, it certainly undermined the informed
20 decision about it.  So if there is was any hope of
21 making an informed decision about whether you should
22 start based on the benefits and risks and -- and someone
23 tells you who should know, well, you know, you can just
24 quit if you want to, that's reassuring when you start
25 smoking, that it's okay because you can minimize your
Specialty Reporting, Inc.
941-468-2779 / nancy@specialtyreporting.com
1 risk and just quit, when, in fact, most people don't
2 quit.
3      Q.   What's the difference between a bad habit,
4 going the McDonald's, versus smoking cigarettes that
5 contain nicotine?
6      A.   The difference is what's driving the behavior.
7 Everyone has to eat.  If you are nicotine addicted,
8 you've become dependent on a drug that you never, ever
9 had to have.  You are using the substance -- the
10 cigarette, in this case -- to get nicotine.  Nicotine is
11 producing changes in your brain and your body that makes
12 you keep on using it.  So your -- your behavior is not
13 simply a matter of willpower or moral strength.  It's a
14 matter of a physiological physical addiction, and an
15 addiction to something that you never, ever had to have,
16 unlike food, which everyone has to eat."
17           MR. ACOSTA:  Dr. Benowitz was the senior
18      editor of one of those Surgeon General's reports.
19      He was the one that was editor of addiction,
20      smoking and addiction, nicotine addiction.  There
21      isn't anybody that knows more than him about
22      nicotine addiction, and all those things that he
23      said were said so that people like you would be
24      informed about what nicotine really does.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor. COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. PERSONS:  And move to strike.
3           THE COURT:  Sustained.
4           MR. ACOSTA:  He talked about the brain.  This
5      was his slide.  He talked about all these hormones
6      that get released, and then what happens when you
7      get hooked on cigarettes?  Your brain doesn't
8      release them anymore, so you feel bad.  It's not a
9      matter of releasing a whole bunch of stuff, like
10      methamphetamine might.  What happens is, it doesn't
11      release them during normal activities, so you wind
12      up smoking more and more and more so that you feel
13      normal.  That's how it works.
14           So if you don't -- you don't smoke, the
15      nicotine doesn't fill the receptors.  When it
16      doesn't fill the receptors but it's looking for
17      them, you feel bad, you feel -- you can feel really
18      pretty bad.
19           So people have to overcome that to stop
20      smoking.  Dr. Benowitz says not everybody stops.  I
21      showed you the DSM, that statistical manual.  Not
22      everybody stops.
23           We have a document from Reynolds that's called
24      the Nordine Study, 1980, where one of their
25      directors says most people aren't able to stop. They knew it.  They knew it, and they did
2      everything they could to keep people smoking back
3      then.
4           You saw that.  It shows how it affects
5      receptors, but it also changes these neuro
6      pathways.  That's what Dr. Benowitz talked about.
7           Then what do they do?  Instead of taking the
8      nicotine out, they intensify its effect.  They make
9      it more potent.  They do it by additives, to change
10      the form to freebase so that it will get to your
11      brain faster.
12           I mean, there's receptors all over your body.
13      If you pinch yourself, you feel it at the same time
14      you pinch yourself.  It doesn't take eight seconds
15      for that to get there.  It's instantaneous.  When
16      the nicotine starts coming in, it's already telling
17      your brain, here it is.  Eight seconds later, the
18      actual drug is in your brain.  That's what it does.
19           And it's the speed that makes it so addictive.
20      That's why people can wear a nicotine patch or take
21      nicotine gum and not get addicted to them.  That's
22      called nicotine replacement therapy, which, for the
23      most part, wasn't available for Mr. Cavalier.  It
24      came later.
25           He died in 1993. This is another Reynolds document, R.J.R.
2      Manipulates Nicotine to Addict and Increase Sales.
3           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, to the
4      slide.
5           THE COURT:  Can you --
6           MR. ACOSTA:  Well, there is evidence of this,
7      Your Honor, increase in physiological satisfaction.
8           THE COURT:  Okay.  That's fine.  I'll
9      overrule.  That's fine.
10           MR. ACOSTA:  That's their name for addiction.
11      That's what they put the ammonia in there for.
12           "Satisfaction" is their code word for
13      "addiction."
14           You saw this.  This was back a few years ago
15      but 48 million smokers at that time, 70 percent
16      want to quit.  Each year 17 million try to quit,
17      but only 3 percent succeed.  I mean, that's the
18      statistic on it.  This isn't something that
19      somebody just made up.  Those are the facts.
20           Now, I put this -- this is a medical record,
21      Mr. Cavalier's medical record.
22           And you heard from family members that he was
23      still smoking.  He wasn't smoking five packs a day
24      after 1989, he was sneaking some cigarettes.  He'd
25      tell his doctors that he stopped smoking, that he quit smoking.  They are going to tell him every
2      time he goes in, if he's smoking to not do it.
3           And he's telling them, well, I'm not.  So he's
4      really trying hard, he's really trying hard; but
5      he's still sneaking a few.
6           The family members, when they're asked these
7      things in their depositions -- you know, lots of
8      questions get asked, and they get cherry-picked out
9      in a trial.
10           This says Social History:  He had been up to a
11      five-pack-a-day smoker, which he has tried to give
12      up.  You don't say somebody "has tried to give it
13      up" unless they are still doing it.
14           They know, they know -- the cigarette industry
15      knew back in 1980 that addicted smokers do not have
16      a free choice, a free choice.  This is their
17      document, this is them saying it.  Okay?  It's not
18      me saying it.
19           Dr. Proctor:  "Tobacco lies helped kill Thomas
20      Cavalier."  And that's true.
21           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's
22      highly inflammatory, improper.
23           THE COURT:  Overruled.  You can proceed.
24           MR. ACOSTA:  Let's play this short little
25      clip, because this is what their lies had to do with Thomas Cavalier.
2 3           "THE NARRATOR:  Tobacco and its use,
4      particularly in cigarettes.  About heart disease,
5      Dr. Seltzer:
6           "DR. SELTZER:  I think where we stand now --
7      the best we can say -- is that we do not know
8      whether or not there is a causal relationship
9      between smoking and heart disease."
10                  (Video clip stopped.)
11           MR. ACOSTA:  So think about it, what would
12      have happened if they had come out and said, look,
13      it causes heart disease, you should be aware of
14      that?
15           This is 1972.  Now, he was about 50 years old
16      at that point, been smoking since he was 15.
17           You heard Dr. Barnett, that you have to admit
18      that you don't start out smoking two packs a day.
19      It takes a while to get up there.
20           One of the records shows him at age 17 at two
21      packs or more a day.  You don't get there right
22      away.  He had to have started a lot earlier, and
23      one of his friends remembered him starting at 15.
24           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, misstates
25      the evidence. COURT:  Sustained.
2           THE CLERK:  10 minutes, Counsel.
3           MR. ACOSTA:  Thank you.
4           They do it with billions of advertisements.
5           You saw this:  The proof is in the pudding
6      here.
7           The sales -- the sales of cigarettes keep
8      climbing despite all this stuff you hear about,
9      despite all these warnings, despite all these
10      Reader's Digest articles, despite all that stuff,
11      sales are going up because they are being
12      overwhelmed by cigarette company messages and
13      advertising.
14           That's why sales go up.  That proves it.  That
15      proves it.  It proves it was working.  It proves
16      that what they did convinced a lot of people to
17      keep on smoking.  And, of course, if you're
18      addicted, there is some hope that you aren't going
19      to -- that -- that your -- that the company is
20      going to fix the problem.  You keep smoking, hoping
21      that maybe they will.  But they don't, and they
22      knew they couldn't.
23           This was from 1953.  This is Dr. Teague, he
24      did that survey.  Look at all the cancer that he
25      found. So they conspire.  In this statement, they
2      told the world that they agreed and they told
3      people that it didn't cause cancer, that it wasn't
4      hazardous, and they were going to do some research
5      on the subject, just to make sure everybody would
6      know the true facts.  It was a lie.  It was a total
7      lie.
8           They -- this is 1959.  They knew that they
9      couldn't take it all out.  Reynolds did.  This is a
10      Reynolds document.  They couldn't take the bad
11      stuff out of the tobacco, but they kept telling
12      people they were going to work on it.
13           Let's play this one.
14 15           "HUGH CULLMAN:  So when we have today 60
16      percent of the business in the whole field compared
17      to 3 percent ten years ago, I think we need a
18      little more research.  I'm convinced that
19      eventually they will find some element, through a
20      filter or through leaf growing or a special type of
21      seed that's growing, that will eliminate the
22      mysterious thing they are looking for.  We want to
23      be the detective just as much as the Surgeon
24      General or the AMA.
25           SPEAKER:  Are you saying then, sir, that there is something toxic about tobacco that is removable
2      by a filter?
3           HUGH CULLMAN:  Obviously, a filter takes out
4      certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think the
5      industry admits there are any bad elements.  If
6      there are bad elements, through our laboratories,
7      through the Surgeon General, through the AMA,
8      through acts of God, and luck, we hope we may find
9      them.  And if they are found, they will be removed.
10      At this point we do not know.  I don't think the
11      tobacco industry as a whole agrees with the
12      conclusions.
13           HARRY REASONER:  $70 million a year is spent
14      to advertise cigarettes in all possible ways,
15      including radio and television.  So far in the
16      developing concern about smoking and health, the
17      national reaction has been to keep smoking.
18           Through the lifetimes of a lot of us,
19      cigarettes have been an intimate and reassuring
20      companion.  The familiar slogans, the familiar
21      packages, have been a part of our lives.  It's like
22      being told that an old friend has all along been
23      betraying you.  In a case like that, you give the
24      old friend every chance before you finally decide
25      to believe what you've been told, and maybe even then, you give him a chance to reform.
2           (Video clip stopped.)
3           MR. ACOSTA:  This is 1968.  1968.
4 5           MIKE WALLACE:  Good evening, I'm Mike Wallace.
6      The question of whether to smoke or not to smoke is
7      one of the most hotly debated controversies in the
8      country.
9           NARRATOR:  The CBS News National Smoking Test.
10           MIKE WALLACE:  Smokers tend to believe
11      statements which say the case is not proven.  The
12      Tobacco Institute, an industry association, says
13      there is no biological proof, either experimental
14      or clinical, that smoking is the cause of diseases.
15           SPEAKER:  Smokers tend to go along with the
16      Tobacco Institute, which says that certain
17      chemicals which may be harmful are more prevalent
18      in some polluted air than in cigarette smoke.
19           MIKE WALLACE:  But the Tobacco Institute
20      believes that obesity, not cigarettes, is a major
21      factor in heart disease.  It says several studies
22      have not shown any association between smoking and
23      heart disease.
24           SPEAKER:  Finally, that you run a greater risk
25      crossing busy streets every day than smoking a pack of cigarettes every day.  The Tobacco Institute
2      says there just isn't documentation available and
3      they add:  "Until we know of any way in which
4      cigarette smoking is, in fact, harmful to health,
5      there is no way for us to say whether this
6      statement is anything more than just speculation."
7           (Video clip stopped.)
8 9           NARRATOR:  From CBS Washington in color, Face
10      the Nation, an unrehearsed news interview with
11      Joseph Cullman, III, Chairman of the Executive
12      Committee of the Tobacco Institute.
13           MR. CULLMAN:  We have no program that I know
14      of to try to help people to stop smoking.  We do
15      talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes
16      are hazardous.  We do not believe that cigarettes
17      are hazardous.  We don't accept that.  And that
18      this industry can face the future with confidence
19      because when, as, and if any ingredient in
20      cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious to
21      human health, we are confident we can eliminate
22      that ingredient.
23           (Video clip stopped.)
24           MR. ACOSTA:  That was their story.  And they
25      keep on with more and more and more of this on TV, newspapers.  I can't show it all to you all over
2      again but there is a lot of it, and they kept up
3      with that thing until they get to 1994 and the CEOs
4      raise their hand and say it's not addictive.  By
5      the way, it doesn't cause any disease either.
6           THE CLERK:  Five minutes, Counsel.
7           MR. ACOSTA:  All right.  Thank you.
8           So we talked about this a little bit in the
9      opening:  Reynolds had choices too, you know?
10      Don't blame it all on Mr. Cavalier.
11           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
12           THE COURT:  Sustained.
13           MR. PERSONS:  Motion.
14           THE COURT:  Denied.
15           MR. ACOSTA:  Blame them.  They are the ones
16      that set this up.  They are the ones that wanted
17      people to buy their products.  They are the ones
18      that knew what was in them.  They are the ones that
19      knew what it would do to people.  They are the ones
20      that made it more addictive.  They denied the
21      truth, they manipulated nicotine, and they chose
22      ammonia to freebase the nicotine.
23           And what do they do?  This one is back when
24      Thomas Cavalier is a little boy, but it's the
25      beginning document that we have on this.  It shows them marketing to kids, and they continued to do
2      that.  They continued to market to kids.  That was
3      how they replaced smokers.
4           You will see in the evidence that we put in,
5      there is a lot of documents that you haven't seen
6      that are in evidence.  That means you will get to
7      see them back there in the room if you want to, but
8      there is a lot of documents from the mid 1970s that
9      talk about products for the youth market.  They
10      wanted to replace -- get youth to smoke, to induce
11      them to smoke through psychological means so that
12      they would start smoking and then get hooked.
13           It's in the documents.
14           Here's this letter.  In 1990, they are writing
15      schoolkids telling them that smoking doesn't cause
16      disease.
17           Remember Bill Farone -- I'm going to go real
18      fast through this -- not all his opinions but he
19      worked at Philip Morris, but he knew what the whole
20      industry did.  In fact, he's studied it since.
21      He's testified at the FDA for the government.  He's
22      an insider.  He told you what they did and what
23      they knew, both about these nitrosamines, which got
24      a lot worse.
25           By the way, they were curing with propane gas just to save a nickel, but it made the cigarette a
2      lot more -- he said twice as carcinogenic.
3           It's disgusting.  These people should be
4      punished -- not these lawyers, but the company.
5      The company should be punished for what it did,
6      because you know what punishment does?  It acts as
7      a deterrent because, if the company knows that
8      another company got punished for lying to people
9      and doing bad things to them, then maybe they won't
10      do it.  That's what it's for.  That's exactly what
11      it's for.
12           He talked about these key problems, that they
13      could have -- even Philip Morris knew how to take
14      stuff like this out but they didn't do it.  They
15      didn't want to change anything because they would
16      lose money.
17           The cigarette company defendants long had
18      firsthand knowledge of unreasonable cigarette
19      dangers while they were publicly denying it.
20           The cigarette company defendants knew how
21      addicting cigarettes are and exploited addiction
22      for profits.
23           The designs and methods that cigarette company
24      defendants use to make cigarettes were developed to
25      addict and to maintain the addiction of smokers despite the unreasonable danger.
2           Each of the cigarette companies agreed with
3      the others that their cigarettes did not cause
4      cancer and were not addictive.
5           The cigarette industry knew how to remove or
6      to reduce harmful agents in cigarette smoke but
7      refused to do it.
8           And you might remember, Farone talked about a
9      couple of cigarette brands that were relatively
10      safe or safe.  They didn't take the addictive ones
11      off the market.  They didn't take the nicotine out
12      of the addictive ones.
13           If the industry had done that across the
14      board, people would have a choice.  People would
15      have a choice then.  People have a choice whether
16      to smoke a pipe or to smoke a cigar.  But when it
17      comes to cigarettes that you inhale that they made
18      inhaleable to do this, that's wrong.
19           The cigarette companies continue to conceal
20      and hide cigarette science and technology to make
21      it appear that what was available to them for years
22      is like new today, you know, like, oh, we're
23      discovering some new things.
24           Well, they knew how to fix a cigarette a long,
25      long time ago by making it either uninhaleable or taking the nicotine out of it.  They could have
2      done either one and people would have had a choice.
3      If you want to smoke tobacco, great, but they're
4      not going to be addicted to it.
5           So at the end, you're going to be asked to
6      fill out a verdict form and, obviously, we think
7      that you should fill out the form in our favor, and
8      that you should decide that punitive damages are
9      warranted.  If you do that, we will have a very,
10      very short -- with maybe one witness -- evidentiary
11      hearing, a continuation of the trial that will be
12      done, most likely, tomorrow afternoon if you
13      finish -- if you have a verdict tonight.
14           If you don't have a verdict tonight -- and I'm
15      certainly not trying to suggest that you should do
16      anything other than fully deliberate until you
17      decide -- until you decide -- what you have here.
18      It's your decision.  Our job is just to give you
19      the information the best way we can so that you can
20      make that decision.  Thank you very much.


2           MR. GARY:  Good afternoon, members of the
3      jury.  I want to take this moment to -- and I don't
4      have much time, but I do want to say thank you.
5      You all have gone beyond the call of duty on this
6      case.  You've been here day in and day out, and
7      you've shown a lot of interest in the case.  So on
8      behalf of my client, Ms. Ann Cavalier --
9           Will you stand, Ms. Cavalier, please?
10           -- I want to say thank you.
11           Members of the jury, you know, this -- but for
12      your service, the system wouldn't work.  Nobody
13      would get justice.  And no matter what you do, do
14      what you feel you have to do.  Do what you feel is
15      right, and we can live with that, because I know,
16      and I believe, that our system of justice is one of
17      the best anywhere in the world.  Anywhere.  And
18      Ms. Ann Cavalier has been waiting on this system
19      for a long time.
20           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.
22           MR. GARY:  Years and years and years, and
23      members of the jury, it's time now -- you know, and
24      I think about all the time that has passed and what
25      she has been through and what she's going through, and maybe by some of the defendant's standard, they
2      talked about him in a way where -- I know he was
3      just a truck driver, but he was an American
4      citizen, members of the jury, and he fought in the
5      war for this country.  And he didn't just fight for
6      this country.  He stood up for his country under
7      gun fire.  He put a fellow soldier on his back and
8      walked miles and miles and miles.
9           Now, let me just say this:  With a third grade
10      education, that really didn't matter, he wanted to
11      serve his country.  You heard the testimony about
12      him trying to get in the Navy, and he didn't have
13      the education to do that.  So he went to the Army
14      and he got in and he served four years -- World
15      War II -- and those were tough times, members of
16      the jury.
17           So I'm calling on you for him, because you owe
18      it to him.
19           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
20           THE COURT:  Sustained.
21           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
22           THE COURT:  Denied.
23           MR. GARY:  Justice, that's all.  Don't give
24      him nothing, just justice.  Give him a fair shot.
25           And members of the jury, I want to just say to you that these people may get away with this.
2           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor,
3      inflammatory.
4           THE COURT:  Referring to the defendants?
5           MR. GARY:  Defendants.
6           THE COURT:  That's fine.
7           MR. GARY:  Because as demonstrated in the
8      case, they have the money, they have the power,
9      they have the resource.
10           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
11           THE COURT:  Sustained.
12           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
13           THE COURT:  Denied.
14           MR. GARY:  Members of the jury, they took
15      someone's deposition.  This is one deposition.  One
16      deposition.  This is one statement.  Hundreds and
17      almost 600, 700 pages, in a deposition.  That's
18      what they can do.  And then they come in the
19      courtroom, because they know that all they have to
20      do is get you to say one word.
21           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
22      Inappropriate.
23           THE COURT:  Sustained.
24           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
25           THE COURT:  Denied. GARY:  On page so and so and so, you
2      didn't say this, you didn't say that.
3           MR. PERSONS:  Same objection.
4           THE COURT:  Overruled.
5           MR. GARY:  Gotcha.
6           MR. PERSONS:  Same objection.
7           THE COURT:  Overruled.
8           MR. GARY:  Members of the jury, they knew they
9      had these ingredients in smoke in that cigarette.
10           Now, I'm a big boy.  If I make my choice, I
11      live with it.  Anybody got a right to know what's
12      in your product because ain't no way you will know
13      but for whoever is selling to you tell you the
14      truth.  And they lied.  And I'm not talking about
15      the lawyers, I'm talking about Reynolds.  They lied
16      and they lied and they lied, and you know they
17      lied.  And it's not right.  And they want to get
18      away with it.
19           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
20           THE COURT:  Overruled.
21           MR. GARY:  Why couldn't they just tell you?
22      Because otherwise you're going to say -- and it's
23      right to say it -- if you smoke, it's your choice,
24      you made it, live with it.  Don't lie and promise
25      something that you know you can't deliver, a safe cigarette, when they knew -- their own documents,
2      members of the jury, their own documents.
3           Their documents that were private, that they
4      had put under lock and key, their documents say --
5      tell the story.  They never thought we would get
6      these documents.  These ain't my documents.  What
7      do they say?  Destroy documents when you are
8      finished reading it.
9           Now why would you say something like that?
10           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.  May we --
11           THE COURT:  Sure, approach, Mr. Persons.  The
12      Judge wants to see them.  Let me take a look.
13 before the
14      Court at the bench and out of the hearing of the
15      jury.)
16           MS. SCHNEIDER:  There is nothing in evidence
17      that says this.  There is no documents on this --
18           MR. GARY:  They did --
19           THE COURT:  The only one I'm concerned about,
20      number 4.  That's the only one.
21           MR. GARY:  It was in there.  It was in there.
22           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Yeah --
23           THE COURT:  Mr. Acosta, number 4, that's the
24      only one I'm concerned about.  Which documents does
25      that relate to? ACOSTA:  This is the --
2           THE COURT:  Switzerland.  That's fine.  So
3      objection is overruled then, that's fine.
4           Counsel, if you want to go over to this side,
5      you're welcome to do that as well.

7 court before the Court and jury.)
8           THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.
9           MR. GARY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
10           Members of the jury --
11           THE COURT:  Hold on, hold on.  Let me look at
12      it.  Not a problem, I'm happy to look.  That's my
13      job.
14           MR. PERSONS:  We want you to look at it.
15           THE COURT:  Not a problem.
16           That's the only one.  That's the only one,
17      take out 27.  That's fine.
18           MS. SCHNEIDER:  There's no dollar sign.  It's
19      40 million cigarettes.
20           THE COURT:  Okay.  That's fine.  Can we
21      just -- just the last two, just cross those out.
22      Otherwise, it's fine.  Okay?
23           MR. GARY:  Take out what, 40, 50?
24           THE COURT:  The dollar sign.  That's a typo.
25           MS. SCHNEIDER:  It's 40 million cigarettes. ACOSTA:  This has to come out.  She's
2      ruled on that.
3           THE COURT:  But otherwise, it's fine.
4           MR. ACOSTA:  We'll get it straight.
5           MR. GARY:  You do that one.  Thank you, Your
6      Honor.
7 in open
8 court before the Court and jury.)
9           MR. GARY:  May I continue?
10           THE COURT:  Of course.  You may continue.
11           MR. GARY:  Members of the jury, you take a
12      peek.  Look at some of the stuff that they did, and
13      they want you, they want you, to say to this man,
14      no justice.  That ain't right.  It's not right,
15      members of the jury, and they know about it.  You
16      look at it.
17           This is what they were doing.  They were --
18      this is what -- I'm not talking about the lawyers,
19      they are good people, but these people, these
20      tobacco people, bad people, what they are.  480,000
21      people die every year from their foolishness.
22           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
23           THE COURT:  Overruled.
24           MR. GARY:  You heard Dr. Farone say, they can
25      make a safer cigarette.  I'm saying, you can say, well, you buy anything I sell, but you're going to
2      sell me some poison and not tell me?  It's not
3      right.  Members of the jury, that's not right.  And
4      they know it.
5           That's why in this case, I'm going to tell you
6      right now, I told you-all when we were picking the
7      jury in this case, the damages was going to be --
8      $10 million is what we're going to be seeking in
9      damages, $10 million, and you may decide that's not
10      enough and you can do more, $10 million.  And it
11      may not be enough.
12           Members of the jury, why do they put the lady,
13      nice lady, I got nothing against her, up there
14      today and say this wasn't -- there was no
15      addiction?
16           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
17           THE COURT:  Overruled.
18           MR. PERSONS:  Attacked the defense's case.
19           THE COURT:  Overruled.
20           MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor, can I have an
21      objection to speaking objections?
22           THE COURT:  Sustained.
23           MR. GARY:  Why did they have her say -- now,
24      that's playing on your intelligence.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Objection. COURT:  Overruled.
2           MR. GARY:  Ladies and gentlemen, how can
3      anybody smoke 100 cigarettes a day and not be
4      addicted?  Dr. Feingold told you, these people
5      ain't stupid.  President Kennedy was smoking
6      cigarettes.  They didn't know because these people
7      were lying to them.  They are liars, bald-faced
8      liars.
9           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
10           THE COURT:  Overruled.
11           MR. PERSONS:  Inflammatory.
12           MR. GARY:  If punitive damages were ever
13      warranted in a case, it's this case.  Bragging
14      about it.  It's not right, members of the jury.
15      It's not right.
16           And let me tell you where the big fight is
17      with me.  There's our kids over there in a foxhole
18      fighting for their country, and they give them
19      rations, 16 cigarettes every single day.
20           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, no evidence.
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.
22           MR. GARY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
23           16 a day.  They can run but they can't hide.
24      16 a day.  Do you know how old these kids were?
25      They were 18 and 19 years old, fighting for their country, and I'm going to show you some letters
2      where they wrote to Reynolds after they got out
3      saying, "Look, why y'all tricked us?  Gave us all
4      these cigarettes?  We didn't even want to smoke.
5      And you said they were safe.  You said they was
6      okay.  We trusted you."
7           Well, guess what?  Reynolds didn't even answer
8      their letter.  All the veterans got together;
9      wouldn't even answer their letter, members of the
10      jury, wouldn't do it.
11           You know this is addiction.  Even if you blame
12      him for it, it's addiction.  They got up there
13      under oath and said it wasn't addiction.  Now,
14      that's not right, tell the truth, and we'll live
15      with the truth.  If it says nothing, that's okay,
16      we'll live with that, but tell the truth.  Don't
17      get up here and tell one lie after another.
18           How can anybody on God's earth smoke 100
19      cigarettes a day and not be addicted?  That's
20      totally impossible.  Members of the jury, this is
21      the Engle finding.  It ain't one of Gary's
22      findings.  This is an Engle finding.  And some of
23      you said, well, where did it come from?  How did it
24      happen?
25           This is a court finding.  This is -- once you find out they are a member of the class, this is
2      the law.  Nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.
3           Well, what did they say about it?  They knew
4      it was addictive, members of the jury.
5           Play the tape, Judge, real quick, play the
6      tape, Washington, D.C., where they went to D.C.,
7      took the oath, swore to tell the truth and nothing
8      but the truth, so help them God, and they lied.
9      They lied.  And only thing I'm saying, I'm a big
10      boy, I own up to my own doings, but you can't lie
11      and get away with it.
12 13           MR. WYDEN:  Let me begin my questioning on the
14      matter of whether or not nicotine is addictive.
15      Let me ask you first, I'd like to just go down the
16      row, whether each of you believes that nicotine is
17      not addictive.
18           I heard virtually all of you touch on it.
19      Just yes or no.  Do you believe nicotine is not
20      addictive?
21           MR. CAMPBELL:  I believe nicotine is not
22      addictive, yes.
23           MR. WYDEN:  Mr. Johnston.
24           MR. J. JOHNSTON:  Congressman, cigarettes and
25      nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction.  There is no
2      intoxication.
3           MR. WYDEN:  We'll take that as a no.  And,
4      again, time is short.  I think each of you believe
5      nicotine is not addictive, and we just would like
6      to have this for the record.
7           MR. TADDEO:  I don't believe that nicotine
8      products are addictive.
9           MR. HORRIGAN:  I believe nicotine is not
10      addictive.
11           MR. TISCH:  I believe that nicotine is not
12      addictive.
13           MR. SANDEFUR:  I believe that nicotine is not
14      addictive.
15           MR. D. JOHNSTON:  And I, too, believe that
16      nicotine is not addictive.
17           (Video clip stopped.)
18           MR. GARY:  Now, you want to know where the
19      conspiracy comes from, don't you?  Members of the
20      jury, that's why they got busted.  They teamed up,
21      they teamed up, and told lies.  Don't take my word
22      for it.  Read the Engle finding.  Just read it
23      briefly.  Just read it.  And I'm coming down to
24      you.
25           But, members of the jury, we didn't drum this up.  The defendants, they ain't just talking about
2      Reynolds, they're talking about all of them, they
3      all got busted.
4           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, criminal
5      activity.
6           THE COURT:  Overruled.
7           MR. GARY:  The defendants agreed to conceal.
8      Now, members of the jury, that's bad, and you know
9      it is.  Why would you conceal going to sell
10      somebody something and conceal something,
11      information about a product that could kill
12      somebody?  Just because you think you can get away
13      with it.
14           What does this one say?  Same thing.  They
15      omitted material information otherwise known.  I
16      told you this was a case about fraud and false --
17      knowing that the material was false or misleading,
18      they misled this young boy, and it ain't right, and
19      you know it's not.  They misled him.
20           All they had to do was tell him the truth, and
21      then if he wanted to smoke, it was his choice, let
22      him smoke, that's all right.  But he's dead and
23      he's gone.  480,000 people every year going down
24      because of their actions.
25           Members of the jury, you got the power to stop this.  You could put your foot down.
2           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, jury
3      nullification.
4           THE COURT:  Sustained.
5           MR. PERSONS:  Motion.
6           THE COURT:  Denied.
7           MR. GARY:  Let me just tell you something.
8      You have a lot of power, and don't you
9      underestimate it.  You have the power to see the
10      wrong and make it right.  You can see suffering and
11      you can stop it.
12           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.  Injecting religion
13      into the case.
14           THE COURT:  Sustained.
15           MR. GARY:  Ain't no religion.
16           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
17           THE COURT:  That's okay.  We'll just move
18      forward.
19           MR. GARY:  You have the power to do that,
20      members of the jury.
21           Let me talk about something that's really near
22      and dear to me, real near and dear to me.  No
23      matter what you do, this will still be near and
24      dear to me.  My children.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, conscienceless.
2           THE COURT:  Overruled.
3           MR. GARY:  Thank you.  This case is about
4      fraud.  It's about lying.  They didn't just lie to
5      adults, but they lied to children.  They lied,
6      members of the jury, and they knew they lied.
7           School days.
8           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, this is opening,
9      and it's a problem.
10           MR. PERSONS:  We had the same issue.
11           THE COURT:  It's overruled now.  This is
12      closing.
13           MR. GARY:  Now, members of the jury, bear with
14      me for a second.
15           Put it back up.
16           School days.  Either one of them.  It's okay.
17      Now, members of the jury, let me -- you know, just
18      put one of the school days up again.
19           Because I want you to see the date.  You're
20      talking about Mr. Cavalier, he did this, and he was
21      35 years old when he first did this.  That's
22      hogwash, okay?
23           You got it?
24           Okay.  Don't look at just the kids, look at
25      the date on it.  What does it say?  1927.  Y'all see that?  Well, that's just -- you know how old
2      little Tommy was then?  He was four years old.  He
3      was just four years old, members of the jury, and
4      they out there, school days are here, and that
5      means big tobacco business for somebody.  Let's get
6      it.
7           Let's go to the next one.
8           Attached is a list of the most important prep
9      schools.
10           Members of the jury, they got -- it's a fair
11      fight with me, if I decide to smoke, it's my fault,
12      let me live with it or go -- he was only four years
13      old when they tracking down schools.
14           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
15           THE COURT:  Sustained.
16           MR. PERSONS:  And move.
17           THE COURT:  Denied.
18           MR. GARY:  It's not a fair fight.
19           Next clip, please.
20           Youth and student magazines.  Now, these are
21      the same people, right when we had some young boys
22      and girls from the school out in California
23      somewhere, we'll get to it in a second, but they
24      said to Reynolds, you know, "Why are you-all
25      letting the candy people use your cigarette packs and your colors and your logos and all of this
2      here?"
3           These are little students writing him.
4           And, guess what, they wrote the students back
5      and said, "We don't do that."
6           They were lying through their teeth.  These
7      were children calling them on the carpet.  It ain't
8      right, members of the jury, and you know it's not.
9           That's not a fair fight.  That's like putting
10      a lightweight in with a heavyweight.
11           You may decide $10 million is not enough, and
12      not a dime less, and I'm going to go over the
13      verdict form with you in a minute, members of the
14      jury, but they are using student magazines.  Now,
15      why would they go buy ads and try to get -- go to
16      the next clip for me, please, real quick.
17           Give every school a good working just as quick
18      as possible.  As soon as the doors open, get in
19      there and get them, children.  And then they wanted
20      you to sit up there and agree with them on that
21      kind of mess.
22           He was four years old.  Don't let them tell
23      you about he could make his choice.
24           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
25           THE COURT:  Sustained. GARY:  He was born in 1923.  Here they
2      are, they are like gangbusters in 1927.  You do the
3      math.
4           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, "gangbusters."
5           THE COURT:  Overruled.
6           MR. GARY:  We're gangbusters.
7           MR. PERSONS:  Objection to the editorial.
8           THE COURT:  That's okay.  We're going to keep
9      moving.
10           MR. PERSONS:  I better get over there where I
11      can see it.
12           MR. GARY:  Now, members of the jury, you know
13      what they were doing --
14           THE COURT:  You need to go to the bathroom?
15      Okay.  I'm sorry.  Restroom break.
16           So let's take a quick five-minute restroom
17      break, everyone.
18           Our poor deputy has got to run around.  He's
19      getting his exercise.
20       (The Jury exited the courtroom at 3:29 p.m.)
21               (Discussion off the record.)
22         (Recess from 3:29 p.m. until 3:37 p.m.)
23           THE COURT:  Mr. Gary, are you ready?  You need
24      a few more minutes?
25           MR. GARY:  We're ready. COURT:  Okay.  Let's bring the jurors back
2      in, please.
3           THE BAILIFF:  Jurors entering.
4      (The Jury entered the courtroom at 3:38 p.m.)
5           THE COURT:  All right.  Welcome back, ladies
6      and gentlemen.  Thank you so much.
7           Ladies and gentlemen, please make yourselves
8      comfortable, and we are going to continue with
9      Mr. Gary.
10           MR. GARY:  May it please the Court.
11           THE COURT:  Yes.
12           MR. GARY:  Members of the jury, I want to just
13      say that when it comes to the kids, that's a
14      special matter.
15           I just think about the defendant telling its
16      people to sell -- try to sell more, but first find
17      out who you and your men find that's not already
18      smoking, in essence.
19           Why would you go to schools like that and do
20      that?  Do they have the right to do that?  And then
21      they're going to get up here and tell you, "Well,
22      what does that have to do with Mr. Cavalier?"
23           Well, he wasn't Mr. Cavalier then, he was
24      Tommy.  He was little Tommy.  See, they are going
25      to fast-forward you like he had all this right to make this decision.
2           But members of the jury, when people get
3      addicted, it's easy to say "Just stop.  Just stop."
4      But that's not like -- it ain't that easy.  A lot
5      of people try over and over and over again, and
6      they just can't.  And then they want to kick them.
7      They got a drug habit.  They are selling the drug.
8      Then they want to blame the people who can't kick
9      the habit.
10           Then you told them all of their life that it's
11      safe.  It's all right.  There is no nicotine.  And
12      you won't get addicted.  And they believe you.  And
13      then you call them crazy and stupid for believing
14      you.  And it's your fault.  You made the choice.
15           They don't have the right to do that, members
16      of the jury, and then go seek, search and find our
17      children?
18           And here -- and when we are talking -- look,
19      don't go for this thing, well, it ain't -- it's
20      just Reynolds.  It ain't the other companies.  They
21      are all in it together.  It's a conspiracy.  That's
22      what it says, "a conspiracy."  They got cited for
23      conspiring to lie to people about their product,
24      about how safe it was.  They didn't tell the truth.
25      And all they had to do was just tell the truth. And then if you make a choice, it's your
2      choice.  But you can't blame me for making a choice
3      when I'm misled or you're withholding information.
4           Look here, they got his children.
5      Fast-forward.  The cigarette people, they are all
6      in it together, members of the jury, it's a
7      conspiracy.  Don't go for this "Well, it ain't --
8      it's not Reynolds.  It's someone else."  No, no,
9      no, no, no.  That's conspiracy, and from the Engle
10      findings, are for all of them together.
11           Now, look at -- you tell about kids in
12      training, and it gets worse than that.  These
13      are -- they give these kids these gift packs
14      with -- real cigarette packs, got them with them in
15      their mouths.  Look at the two young ladies, the
16      sisters, they are back here in the courtroom.  You
17      started them early.  They knew what they were
18      doing.  They got the money.  They do the
19      advertising.  They do the focus groups.  They do
20      all that stuff.  They knew what they were doing.
21           Now, before I go there, let me just -- let me
22      just -- you're talking about in training.
23           Help me out here so I can move a little
24      faster.
25           This is real.  This is real.  He didn't have a chance.  Because he started back here.  They get
2      you.  They get you.  And then they want to say "You
3      made the choice.  You made the choice.  You didn't
4      have to do it."
5           Real packs.  Real packs.  I mean they shared
6      their -- their -- their private secrets with them
7      in terms of the -- the makeup of their packs and
8      the cigarettes and all that.  You had the little
9      tip that look just like a cigarette.  And some of
10      them like you could blow the smoke out of them.  I
11      mean, they were going after these kids.
12           And members of the jury, you're going to see
13      and I may not get to it, but I've got boards from
14      their own documents, from their own archives, from
15      their own cabinets, where they are saying we
16      need -- if we don't get the kids, we're going to go
17      out -- we are going to lose a lot of money.  We've
18      got to get them.  These are -- put them in
19      training, because guess what, the others are going
20      to die.
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
10           MR. GARY:  Tobacco is a relatively efficient
11      nicotine delivery system.  Nicotine is a drug,
12      members of the jury.  How do they get away with it,
13      you tell me, without telling the truth?
14           The government never agreed to let you do it
15      with -- and lie about it.  They agreed to let you
16      do it, but you had to tell the truth.  They lied to
17      the government.
18           Where do we go from here?  Our obvious route
19      is to give people more nicotine if the tar is
20      reduced.  One way or the other, we're going to get
21      you.  You're going to get hooked.
22           Think about those young boys coming back from
23      the war, wrote them, asking them to say -- to tell
24      them why all our people are dying from cancer.
25           Members of the jury, some of them stayed over there and they fought, dodging bombs and bullets,
2      ducking bombs and bullets, come back to die a
3      dishonor -- they got an honorable discharge, and
4      they came back to die a dishonorable death.
5           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, no
6      evidence.
7           THE COURT:  Sustained.
8           MR. GARY:  Increase the nicotine.  Now they're
9      talking about, in snowing you, "Well, it's already
10      in the tobacco.  We take it out and we just put it
11      back in."  But does this say increase here?  They
12      are talking about increasing the nicotine.  And
13      that's what -- and they already increased it.  They
14      want to increase it more.  These are their
15      documents.
16           See, because members of the jury, I want you
17      all to know one thing, all these documents we're
18      showing you, we didn't go out and find them.  They
19      had to give them up by law.
20           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
21           THE COURT:  Sustained.
22           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
23           THE COURT:  Sustained.  I'll deny the motion.
24           MR. GARY:  Their documents, can you believe
25      that?  10 seconds.  You don't even have a chance. If you're some young boy, 12 or 13 years old
2      smoking --
3           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
4           THE COURT:  Overruled.
5           MR. GARY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
6           You don't even have a chance.  If you're in
7      middle school, just happen to get a cigarette, you
8      didn't even have a chance.
9           And back then -- and then they want to get up
10      and say well, he was 35 years old when he -- and
11      then they tell you, "use these medical records,
12      they are the best evidence."  Well, the medical
13      records showed he had been smoking for 50 years,
14      which would put him back in his low teens.
15           MR. PERSONS:  Objection; misstates the
16      evidence.
17           THE COURT:  Overruled.
18           MR. GARY:  Which would be maybe 14, 15, or 16
19      when they got him.  And if you -- members of the
20      jury, if you say little Tommy, who was 14 or 15
21      years old made his choice and he should have to
22      live with it, then we all go home, and there ain't
23      no justice.
24           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
25           THE COURT:  Sustained. PERSONS:  Nullification.  And move --
2           THE COURT:  Deny motion.
3           MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor, may we ask,
4      assuming that counsel is trying to save time,
5      perhaps he can just -- no speaking objections.
6           THE COURT:  Okay.
7           MR. CHESTNUT:  Object to court rules, and then
8      if Mr. Gary requires it --
9           THE COURT:  We're both doing great.  So let's
10      keep on going.
11           MR. GARY:  I'm doing great now, Your Honor?
12           THE COURT:  You're keeping it up.
13           MR. GARY:  Within 10 seconds of starting to
14      smoke nicotine is available in your brain.  Think
15      about it.
16           10 seconds.
17           And you are doing 100 of these a day.  And
18      that -- the expert lady came in here and said, "oh,
19      he wasn't addicted."  Now, that should have been
20      the point where you should say, "Hey, wait a
21      minute.  We ain't stupid."  Because that's playing
22      on your intelligence.
23           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
24           THE COURT:  Sustained.
25           MR. GARY:  Let us look at what we are currently -- now, members of the jury, this is one
2      of their records -- one of their records.  They --
3      you heard me talk about they didn't want to go
4      through -- they went and started a research company
5      all the way over in -- what -- what -- country was
6      that?  Germany.  And guess why they did it?  They
7      said because we don't want them to be able to
8      subpoena our records.  They knew what they was
9      doing.  They knew what they were doing.
10           Before starting on any future scenario, the
11      marketing scenario, let us look at what we are
12      currently selling and where and how it has
13      developed.
14           A cigarette as a drug administration system
15      for public use has very, very significant
16      advantages.
17           This is what we're dealing with, members of
18      the jury.  These are their records they never
19      thought would see the light of day.
20           Different people smoke cigarettes for
21      different reasons.
22           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Objection, Your Honor, this is
23      not in evidence.
24           THE COURT:  Okay.  Let's move forward.
25           MR. GARY:  Now, here they are giving impression -- members of the jury, Dr. Proctor told
2      you about how they paid people off, the
3      politicians.  Oh, they had the power, and they
4      could get done what they needed to get done.
5           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
6           THE COURT:  Overruled.
7           MR. GARY:  They paid doctors.
8           THE COURT:  You can continue.
9           MR. GARY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
10           They got doctors.  The nerve of them putting
11      out information that's saying that it -- if you
12      smoke this type cigarette, it's safer for you if
13      you are pregnant for your baby.  Now, that's a
14      flat-out lie, and they knew they was lying to sell
15      cigarettes -- to sell cigarettes.  Unborn baby.
16           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, no
17      evidence.
18           THE COURT:  Sustained.
19           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
20           THE COURT:  Denied.
21           MR. GARY:  I've been talking about choice,
22      right?  We've been talking about doing --
23           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, this is not in
24      evidence.
25           THE COURT:  That's okay. Move forward.
2           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Not in evidence, Your Honor.
3           THE COURT:  That's okay.  Move forward.
4           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Would you sustain my
5      objection?
6           THE COURT:  Sustained.
7           MR. GARY:  Now, after they had --
8           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Not -- okay.  I'm sorry.
9           MR. GARY:  After they had their secret meeting
10      in New York at the Plaza, the Plaza Hotel, all the
11      owners went to New York, private meeting, and they
12      got their thoughts together.  They said, "Look, we
13      may fight during the week.  We may fight to get
14      business.  But one thing we cannot fight about is
15      this lie we got to tell about there's no nicotine,
16      it's not addictive, we don't sell nicotine," and
17      all of them agreed to do it.  "And we also got to
18      tell people that it's safer, we got cigarettes
19      that's really" -- they were telling people that if
20      you smoke our cigarettes, it will kill you.  If you
21      had an ailment, it would make you well.  I mean,
22      they had people buying cigarettes for all kinds of
23      reasons.  And it's okay, members of the jury, if
24      you buy the product because you are informed and
25      you know what it is and you are an adult, that's okay.  You buy this, it's your fault because they
2      told you the truth.
3           And, members of the jury, you see commercials
4      on television.  Right now they will tell you
5      everything that can happen with that product.
6      They -- because they want to you make an informed
7      decision.  You can't have somebody taking a drug
8      that you don't tell them about that it's a drug and
9      you don't tell what's in it.  They wasn't telling
10      nobody.  Even back then, I'm talking about back in
11      the '40s, '50s, and '60s, and even the '70s.
12           And just remember this:  There was no warning,
13      because they stand behind the warning.  Now, one
14      that they didn't even want, they fought against it,
15      they said they didn't need it, but now they stand
16      behind it.  "Aha, we had a warning."
17           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
18           THE COURT:  Overruled.
19           MR. GARY:  And members of the jury, they
20      didn't get a warning until 1965.  By this time,
21      Mr. Cavalier had been smoking 20-plus, 35 years.
22      Sad to say, but this war veteran was -- was sick.
23      Dr. Proctor said it, and Dr. Feingold said it, and
24      Dr. Farone said it, and even -- even -- even some
25      of their witnesses said, "Heart disease, smoking; liver disease, smoking; COPD, smoking."
2           And, members of the jury, that smoke, you saw
3      what was in it.  It's like a train wreck inside of
4      your body.  You think it's just going to hit one
5      organ and stop.  It's like a train wreck.  It -- it
6      spares nothing.  It gets all in your system.
7           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor,
8      misstatement of the evidence.
9           THE COURT:  Overruled.
10           MR. GARY:  You can count on us.  After that
11      meeting, "Don't worry about a thing.  We've got
12      your back.  You can count on us.  If we find
13      anything in it that's not good, we will tell you
14      about it."
15           And they already knew it was cancerous.  They
16      knew it had carcinogens in it.  They knew it when
17      they were telling this bald-faced lie.
18           That came from their documents.
19           MS. SCHNEIDER:  No, Your Honor, this is not in
20      evidence.
21           THE COURT:  Okay.  Let's move forward.
22           It's sustained.
23           MS. SCHNEIDER:  No, Your Honor, this is not in
24      evidence.
25           THE COURT:  Sustained. MS. SCHNEIDER:  No, Your Honor, this is not in
2      evidence.
3           THE COURT:  It's a demonstrative.
4           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection to the previous
5      document.
6           THE COURT:  Okay.  That's fine.  Sustain the
7      previous one.  This is fine.  This is fine.
8           MR. GARY:  Say what now?
9           THE COURT:  You can proceed.  I'm sorry,
10      Mr. Gary.
11           MR. GARY:  Oh, okay.
12           Members of the jury, they're talking about all
13      the poisons that are later discovered in a
14      cigarette.  Let me ask you this:  How does anybody
15      get a chance to get away with having a product
16      that's got poison in it and not tell you about it
17      and you buy it and they blame you for believing
18      them?
19           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
20           THE COURT:  Overruled.
21           MR. GARY:  You heard of all the poisons.  What
22      is a poison?  It kills.  480,000 deaths every year
23      to smoke, 480,000, and they just want you to take
24      it like it's a grain of salt.  It's not a big deal.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor. COURT:  Overruled.
2           MR. GARY:  Now, why would you hide all this?
3      You want to talk about you want people to make a
4      choice, an informed choice, why would you hide all
5      of this?
6           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, this is not in
7      evidence.  This is the one we actually had the huge
8      argument about.
9           THE COURT:  Sustained.
10           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
11           THE COURT:  Overruled.
12           MR. GARY:  They wrote them the letter, to
13      Reynolds, said, "Why did y'all do it to us?  You
14      gave us 16 cigarettes a day."  I mean, why did they
15      have to give them so many a day?  Why didn't they
16      just, for that matter, one or two?  They were
17      trying to get them hooked because they wanted
18      customers when they got back home.  Now, these
19      young men and woman fought and they -- some died
20      for their country, and that's what they got.
21           But these defendants took the position, "Oh,
22      yeah, we'll go in and litigate it."
23           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
24           THE COURT:  Sustained.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Motion. COURT:  Denied.
2           MR. GARY:  There are the rations, breakfast,
3      lunch, and dinner.
4           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  No
5      evidence.  No foundation for it.
6           THE COURT:  Overruled.
7           MR. GARY:  That's what they were doing.  The
8      truth hurts.
9           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
10           THE COURT:  Sustained.
11           MR. PERSONS:  Motion.
12           THE COURT:  Denied.
13           MR. GARY:  Here is the letter:  "Veterans of
14      Foreign Affairs.  We all remember that during World
15      War II, we were given all the cigarettes we needed,
16      and many young men and women started the smoking
17      habit who had never smoked before who never ever
18      intended to smoke."
19           They got them.  They got them.
20           THE COURT:  Mr. Gary, eight minutes.
21           MR. GARY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
22           Right after the war, when we got home, in
23      essence, members of the jury, they found out that
24      something was wrong.  They had been conversing with
25      them, selling them cigarettes, doing all kinds of stuff.  Then when they got called on the carpet
2      about the lies they had told these young men and
3      women, they lied to us about the doctor said it was
4      okay, and then they found -- Reynolds -- let me
5      tell you something.  What Reynolds did, what these
6      people did, when they first found out -- they were
7      given -- see, part of -- part of their -- how they
8      were going to snow people, they said --
9           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
10           THE COURT:  Sustained.
11           MR. GARY:  They said, "We're going to give you
12      grants to do research."  That's what they said, and
13      they told the public that.  But they got certain
14      people to do it.  And then when these people
15      started finding -- started discovering that these
16      cigarettes were causing cancer, man, they fired
17      those people so fast your head would swim.  "Get
18      out of here.  We ain't looking for no truth."
19           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
20           THE COURT:  Overruled.
21           MR. GARY:  We got -- these kids said, "We
22      thought you said your doctors said it was okay.  We
23      would like to have a full report from research men
24      of the tobacco companies who were familiar with
25      testing and examining" -- look.  You test and why you examine your own product because they still
2      wanted to believe the lies, the lies, they wanted
3      to believe them.  But now they are getting
4      concerned because they found out there was cancer
5      in this stuff.
6           "Trusting you will favor us with a reply."
7      They didn't even answer these kids.
8           MR. PERSONS:  Objection; "kids."
9           THE COURT:  Overruled.
10           MR. GARY:  Didn't even answer them.
11           THE COURT:  Five minutes, Mr. Gary.
12           MR. GARY:  How many, Your Honor?
13           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, this is not in
14      evidence.
15           THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained.
16           MR. GARY:  Members of the jury, there are
17      going to be two phases, but the second phase is
18      going to be short.
19           MS. SCHNEIDER:  Object, Your Honor; "two
20      phases. "
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.
22           MR. GARY:  The first question you got to
23      answer:  "Was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of
24      Thomas Cavalier's coronary heart disease, and if
25      so" -- "and if so, was coronary heart disease a legal cause of his death."
2           Members of the jury, you've heard -- I'm not
3      going to go over all the testimony again.  You
4      heard their own witness say -- she said this
5      morning, heart disease, COPD, and liver disease, so
6      you can check that "yes."
7           Then after checking that "yes," you will go on
8      to Number 2:  "Was Thomas Cavalier addicted to
9      cigarettes containing nicotine?"
10           Now, you know we've proven that.  You know
11      we've proven it and ain't nothing they can say
12      about that.
13           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
14           THE COURT:  Sustained.
15           MR. GARY:  "Did Thomas Cavalier reasonably
16      rely to his detriment" -- now, you wanted me -- do
17      I have to go through the Engle findings again,
18      where they trumped up stuff, they lied, they
19      withheld information that was detrimental?
20      "Detriment" means to your detriment, withholding
21      information that could lead to your death, and they
22      still wouldn't give it up.
23           "Did Thomas Cavalier reasonably rely to his
24      detriment on either a statement or omission of
25      material" -- you know they were running around talking -- they're in Congress, on -- on every air
2      wave in the world lying about nicotine wasn't
3      addictive, and that their cigarettes were safe.
4      They were lying all over the place.  He doesn't
5      have a voice now because he's dead and he's gone.
6           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
7           THE COURT:  Overruled.
8           MR. GARY:  But you can be the voice.
9           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
10           THE COURT:  Sustained.
11           MR. PERSONS:  Motion.
12           THE COURT:  Denied.
13           MR. GARY:  "Did Thomas Cavalier reasonably
14      rely to his detriment" -- he's dead -- "on either a
15      statement or omission made in furtherance of R.J.
16      Reynolds," and there were many others, "agreement
17      to conceal material information not otherwise known
18      or available concerning the health effects or
19      addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and if so,
20      was such reliance a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's
21      coronary heart disease?"
22           Members of the jury, you heard from the
23      family.  They knew a lot of things, but they didn't
24      know that this smoke had all these chemicals in it.
25      They didn't know that this smoke could kill you like it's killing 400 -- you think 480,000 people
2      would just go out and use a product every year?
3      These people are dying now because they started 30
4      years ago.
5           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
6           THE COURT:  Overruled.
7           Mr. Gary, one minute.  Would you like to use
8      more time from your rebuttal?
9           MR. GARY:  Yeah.
10           THE COURT:  Okay.  That's fine.
11           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
12           THE COURT:  That's fine.
13           Deny the motion.
14           MR. GARY:  See, that's the thing, members of
15      the jury.  You were told by one of the doctors, and
16      I can't remember his name, but it's -- it's -- once
17      that smoke, and it's powerful, and they make it so
18      they -- menthol, so you can get it down in your
19      body, deep down in your body real easy.  It goes to
20      your brain in 10 seconds.  They get you.  They get
21      you hooked, and you know they get you hooked.
22      That's why punitive damages is -- should be awarded
23      in this case.  They can't get away with it.  And I
24      don't care how fancy they talk.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor. COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
3           THE COURT:  Denied.
4           MR. GARY:  Put the next one.
5           Members of the jury, you may decide that $10
6      million is not enough.  That's your decision.  I
7      suggest that.
8           And let me say this, members of the jury, one
9      thing, I got to give my client credit for.  Up
10      here, please -- let me just make sure -- Glen,
11      you're taller than I am.
12           "Was there any fault on the part of Thomas
13      Cavalier that was a cause of his coronary heart
14      disease and death?"  Yes.
15           Let's play by the rules.  Give him some
16      responsibility.  We said that day one in this
17      trial.  They are the one that came in here kicking
18      and screaming talking about they didn't do nothing
19      wrong but knew they had told all these lies.
20           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
21           THE COURT:  Sustained.
22           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
23           THE COURT:  Denied.
24           MR. GARY:  Members of the jury, when they
25      started this on the -- this attack on kids in school system and you saw it, that was Reynolds.
2      He was only four years old then.  Was he four?  He
3      was four years old.  So we give him -- even if we
4      gave him 10 percent, 90 percent there and 10
5      percent there, and the foreperson will sign.
6           Now, members of the jury, let me close by
7      saying this.  We get a chance to talk to you a
8      little bit more, that's the system.  We have the
9      burden of proof.  We have the burden of proof.  And
10      my partner, Mr. Chestnut, will close it out.
11           I want to thank you for your time.  Do
12      whatever you think is right.  But before I leave, I
13      want to talk about a lady.  Her name is Lady
14      Justice.  Some of you may have seen her in the
15      courtroom, maybe on TV or whatever, but she's a
16      lady that stands with the scales in her hand.  When
17      I think about her, I think about judgment, because
18      sometimes you have to realize that there is going
19      to be a judgment day.
20           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
21           THE COURT:  Sustained.
22           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
23           THE COURT:  Denied.
24           MR. GARY:  Lady Justice don't even want to see
25      who you are.  She's blindfolded.  And you know why she doesn't want to see?  And she's got the scales
2      that are even, y'all remember we talked about that
3      when we were picking the jury, and she's got a
4      sword in the other hand, and she's blindfolded.  Do
5      you know why she's blindfolded?  She's blindfolded
6      because she doesn't even want to see who you are if
7      you are seeking justice.  Your color doesn't
8      matter.
9           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
10           THE COURT:  Sustained.
11           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
12           THE COURT:  Denied.
13           MR. GARY:  She doesn't want to see who you
14      are.  She just wants to know that it's about
15      justice.
16           So in years to come, because you are going to
17      build some relationships here that's going to last,
18      that's going to withstand the test of time.  Oh,
19      yeah.  This ain't all about Mr. Cavalier.  This is
20      about a whole lot here, this is about making a
21      difference.  This is about --
22           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
23           THE COURT:  Sustained.
24           MR. PERSONS:  And motion.
25           THE COURT:  Denied. GARY:  Members of the jury, I mean, I've
2      seen the bonding, you know, and it's great.  It's
3      just real -- it really is.  I mean, the closeness.
4      You-all will be friends for life.  It's not this --
5      so this is a good thing for you, and that's why I
6      say, you know, just do what's in your heart, do the
7      right thing, and we -- that's all anybody can ask
8      for.
9           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
10           THE COURT:  Sustained.
11           MR. PERSONS:  Motion.
12           THE COURT:  Denied.
13           MR. GARY:  When it comes to justice, just do
14      what you feel is fair and what is right.
15           And then, members of the jury, when it's all
16      said and done, be proud.  You be proud of your
17      verdict.
18           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
19           THE COURT:  Overruled.
20           MR. GARY:  Be proud because this is America,
21      the home of the brave and the free.  This is
22      America, and only in America, only in America, can
23      a truckdriver, a truckdriver, didn't have any
24      education, maybe two, three years, but you heard
25      the testimony about Thomas Cavalier.  Even witness today said that he was a hard worker.  He
2      worked every day, members of the jury.  He
3      wasn't -- every single day he worked.  Even
4      sometimes 7:00 -- early in the morning, come back
5      as late as 7:00 at night, and then they are going
6      to get up and say, well, he was watching TV and...
7           Another thing about this, did he have
8      knowledge of what was going on.  Reader's Digest,
9      they had 400 pages, they probably had one paragraph
10      about smoking.  Reader's Digest.  It was in the
11      newspaper.  They keep talking about, well, you're
12      in New York where all the stuff goes down, you
13      should have known about smoking, you should have
14      known this, known that.
15           What was Reynolds doing?  Let them show you
16      one ad that they put in the papers telling people
17      about these chemicals that were in cigarettes.
18      When they get up here and talk to you, say show me
19      one ad, don't tell me about what somebody's put in
20      the paper, what was in the local news, what was in
21      the local newspaper, show me what you did to say to
22      people, they talk about oh, it's a cancer stick,
23      they knew this from 100 years ago and all that
24      stuff, and they haven't put one article in the
25      paper yet, they haven't said one thing, and they are going to have you believe they should have
2      known because it was in the local paper, it was on
3      the legal news, it was on this, it was on that.
4      But what did Reynolds do?  And when they come up
5      here with that, you ask that question to yourself
6      and see what kind of answer that you get, other
7      than the fact that they lied and said they were
8      going to put money in research and as soon as they
9      got research they didn't like, they fired
10      everybody.  They even killed the rats.
11           MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
12           THE COURT:  Overruled.
13           MR. GARY:  Justice.  Justice.  Justice.
14      Justice, that's the heart and Saul of the American
15      jury system.  If anybody should question you, it
16      may be years to come, about this trial, I want you
17      to say I was there?  Our courtroom in West Palm
18      Beach, Florida, and I gave little Tommy, little
19      Tommy, the war veteran that went half a mile with
20      his friend on his back with a soldier on his back,
21      fighting for his country, that's right.  I want you
22      to say I was there and I tried to do the right
23      thing, I gave him justice that was the heart and
24      soul of the American dream.
25           MR. PERSONS:  Objection 124689 overruled. GARY:  Thank you, thank you.


14            MR. CHESTNUT:  Good afternoon, ladies and
15       gentlemen.  As the judge said, we're in the home
16       stretch, so I'll try to summarize everything up
17       real quick.
18            So I'm tasked with giving a rebuttal to some
19       of the things you heard in closing arguments,
20       ladies and gentlemen.  And there was so much
21       misinformation, it was difficult for me, obviously,
22       to know where to start.  So let's just start with
23       R.J. Reynolds.
24            But I think, you know, this picture of the
25       Plaza Hotel probably sums it up best, ladies and  gentlemen.  Because, in 1955, when the execs are
2       meeting, in the penthouse of the Plaza Hotel there
3       is a 22-year-old truck driver who is making
4       deliveries in the city of New York, smoking the
5       cigarettes, a victim of the very conspiracy this
6       industry is perpetuating, that R.J. Reynolds was a
7       participant in.
8            R.J. Reynolds, these are old school players,
9       but you know what the problem with old school
10       players is?  This is the dotcom age.  Old school
11       players don't accept the evidence.  You catch
12       somebody speeding back in the day, they say, Oh,
13       no, Officer, that wasn't me.
14            But I clocked you.
15            No, that wasn't me.
16            I clocked you with a laser and there is nobody
17       else on the road.
18            Or somebody is cheating on their girlfriend
19       and say, oh, it wasn't me.  What do they do?  Old
20       school players do three things:  Lie, deny, then
21       blame the victim.  That wasn't me.
22            In 2015 -- that might work in '55, but in
23       2015, what happens?  No, no, this is an Instagram
24       picture and that's your tattoo and that's the shirt
25       I bought you. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what's happening
2       today.
3            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
4            THE COURT:  Sustained.
5            MR. PERSONS:  I have a motion.
6            THE COURT:  Denied.
7            MR. CHESTNUT:  I'm talking about
8       R.J. Reynolds, not the attorneys.  I'm talking
9       about R.J. Reynolds, the company.  R.J. Reynolds
10       whoever he is, that person.
11            Members of the jury, let's just go through.
12       Now, these are self-prescribed lies.  They told us
13       in '55 during that conspiracy that they were
14       developing a conspiracy for what?  Litigation,
15       politics, and public opinion.  What are they doing?
16       Our basic position is:  Cigarette controversy.
17       Here's what important, that we are making false or
18       misleading statements to promote the sale of
19       cigarettes.
20            This is an internal R.J.R. -- I'm sorry, this
21       is a Tobacco Institute document, confidential,
22       where they are calling themselves liars.  We don't
23       have to do it.  They are doing it.
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
10            MR. CHESTNUT:  -- documents internal or that
11       belong to the tobacco industry.
12            Let's ask this, ladies and gentlemen:  Let's
13       look at how come none of their experts explained to
14       you any of these documents from any of the tobacco
15       companies?  Running -- their documents were running
16       from the documents.
17            MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
18            THE COURT:  Denied.
19            MR. CHESTNUT:  Let's go through and let's talk
20       about addiction.  So we'll do a credibility of
21       witnesses first, ladies and gentlemen.
22            Dr. -- I tell you what, 508192, there was a
23       question if Mr. Cavalier was addicted.  Here's a
24       document, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of what
25       test you want to employ, here is a document by  James W. Lea where it says "Social History.
2            192.  Thank you.
3            Five pack a day, which he has tried to give
4       up.  He tried to quit, he couldn't quit.
5            How about 133, Brian.
6            He's a -- he is a heavy nicotine abuse smoker,
7       five packs a day.  This is another doctor, Dr. Lea,
8       saying he has nicotine abuse.  Now, they brought in
9       a psychiatrist to --
10            Can we go to the slides.
11            -- to talk to you about addiction, to testify
12       to you, ladies and gentlemen, that Mr. Cavalier
13       wasn't addicted.  First of all, let's talk about
14       credibility of witnesses.  They didn't produce a
15       witness to you that wasn't on their payroll.  The
16       two people they put in front of you, they paid.
17            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
18            THE COURT:  Overruled.
19            MR. CHESTNUT:  Now, five packs a day, 100
20       cigarettes per day, for a 160 pack-years.  In
21       Mr. Cavalier's life, he had 7,340 cigarettes times
22       160 years; 1.6 8 million cigarettes, 11.68 puffs,
23       and she's saying he's not addicted.
24            Can we go to the slides?  1439.
25            Now, the psychiatrist they brought in did --  didn't speak at all to their documents.  We'll come
2       back to it.
3            MR. GARY:  There it is.
4            MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, this is not in
5       evidence.
6            THE COURT:  Sustained.
7            MR. CHESTNUT:  Here's a memo from the planning
8       committee.  "It's unfortunate for us that
9       cigarettes are a habit they can't break."  This is
10       a tobacco document.  They brought in an expert to
11       say tobacco is not addictive, Mr. Cavalier did is
12       not addicted.
13            Why didn't they explain this document?  It's
14       their document.  Nobody's ever become --
15            MS. SCHNEIDER:  This document is not in
16       evidence.
17            THE COURT:  Sustained.
18            MR. CHESTNUT:  "Cigarette is more addictive
19       than using heroin."
20            MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, this is not in
21       evidence.
22            MR. ACOSTA:  I think this one was.
23            MR. CHESTNUT:  Narcotic value that --
24            MS. SCHNEIDER:  Your Honor, this is not in
25       evidence. THE COURT:  Sustained.
2            MS. SCHNEIDER:  This is not in evidence.
3            THE COURT:  Sustained.
4            MR. ACOSTA:  Two slides back was in evidence,
5       "Structure of Creativity Group."
6            MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor, is the death
7       certificate in evidence?
8            MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
9            MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
10            THE COURT:  Sustained.
11            MR. CHESTNUT:  Just wanted to confirm before I
12       publish it.
13            Can I have C 1?
14            Now, members of the jury, let's just be
15       consistent.  The question ultimately is -- and
16       you've been over the verdict form a number of
17       times -- it's "a" versus "the."  When we look at
18       the definition of both of these, "a" means it has
19       to be one of many causes.  "The" means it's the
20       only cause.  Indefinite, definite.
21            The jury instruction -- every instruction says
22       "a," that smoking was a cause --
23            MR. HOHNBAUM:  A legal cause.
24            THE COURT:  Overruled.
25            MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor. THE COURT:  Overruled.
2            MR. CHESTNUT:  That smoking was a cause of
3       coronary artery disease.
4            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, a legal.
5            THE COURT:  Overruled.
6            MR. CHESTNUT:  Your Honor --
7            THE COURT:  Overruled.
8            MR. CHESTNUT:  So we know here, so when you go
9       back in the jury room and you are reviewing this
10       death certificate, it's most important, ladies and
11       gentlemen, is that there are two other lines here
12       that weren't, but in 2008, the doctor attributes
13       lung cancer as a cause of death as well.  So we
14       know at least Dr. Cowen has COPD and lung cancer.
15       The medical records corroborate congestive heart
16       failure -- congestive heart disease as -- coronary
17       artery disease as a cause of death as well.
18            The issue is this, ladies and gentlemen:  The
19       documents, the medical records, they will be in
20       evidence, you can review them.  It's a
21       multifactorial cause.  "Multifactorial" means many.
22       The evidence that there are many causes,
23       smoking-related causes, to Mr. Cavalier's death,
24       COPD, lung cancer, coronary -- these are all Engel
25       diseases.  Coronary artery disease -- Okay, thank you.  Thank you.
2            -- diabetes, and lung cancer.
3            Credibility of witnesses, ladies and
4       gentlemen.
5            Now, they brought in a doctor, Dr. W, from
6       California, who testified on a number of issues,
7       ladies and gentlemen.
8            THE CLERK:  10 minutes, Counsel.
9            MR. CHESTNUT:  Thank you.
10            Before we go to Dr. W, why don't we go to
11       Dr. Feingold.
12            Can I go through the Feingold slides?
13            This is testimony.  "Can smoking cause lung
14       cancer?"
15            "Yes."
16            "People who smoke, more than one million.
17       Number one additional cause beyond lipid and
18       development of coronary artery disease is smoking."
19            "Is diabetes a significant or primary
20       contributing fact to his ischemia?"
21            "No, sir."
22            "Is smoking typically a problem caused by
23       ischemic cardiomyopathy?"
24            "In a patient who has diabetes that smokes,
25       the risk of getting diabetic ischemia is enormous." Atherosclerotic heart disease.  "Heart
2       dysfunction shows up by 1990 in his medical
3       records," meaning he's diagnosed with heart disease
4       in 1990, which is within the statute.  This is all
5       testimony.
6            I'm showing you the testimony, but if you
7       recall, Dr. Feingold spent the time to walk
8       through -- walk you through a PowerPoint where he
9       corroborated his conclusions with medical evidence
10       and this patient's medical history.  He did his
11       own.  He signed off on his opinions.
12            We jump to 1993.  He has cardiomyopathy.  He's
13       suffering from cardiomyopathy.  He has myocardial
14       infarction, a heart attack, death of the heart
15       muscle.  He's treated with dopamine.  Dopamine is
16       treated only for EF, which is a heart disease.
17       There is abundant evidence that he has congestive
18       heart failure.
19            Now, members of the jury, their expert, Dr.
20       W., came in all the way from California.  Let's
21       just talk a minute.  All right?  Let's just pause.
22       You know, earlier you heard the term, "it defies
23       common sense."  Well, let's just take common sense.
24       We have a doctor, who is a cardiologist, a heart
25       doctor, who claims to specialize in what?  Preventive, which means he prevents heart disease,
2       and intervention, which means he intervenes on
3       people's sick hearts to fix them, who for $9,000
4       comes all the way from California to Florida to
5       testify twice in one day, two trials in one day,
6       for the same industry, tobacco, that their products
7       the Supreme Court of Florida says causes these
8       diseases, to include heart disease.
9            Did not cause heart disease.  So the very
10       thing that he allegedly stands for, "I protect
11       people's heart, I believe in preventive medicine,"
12       but yet he's testifying for a company that produces
13       a product that's one of the leading causes of heart
14       disease --
15            MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
16            THE COURT:  Overruled.
17            MR. CHESTNUT:  -- in America.  Moreover,
18       ladies and gentlemen, let's just think about what
19       he does.  He said, "Well, 70 percent of my time is
20       spent for plaintiffs.  I sue doctors for medical
21       malpractice."  He spends his time singling out
22       doctors.  For $9,000, he basically sold his soul,
23       ladies and gentlemen.
24            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
25            THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. CHESTNUT:  It goes to credibility, Your
2       Honor.
3            MR. PERSONS:  And a motion.
4            MR. CHESTNUT:  He says -- he says he is
5       preventive medicine --
6            MR. PERSONS:  I have a motion.
7            THE COURT:  Deny the motion.  You may
8       continue, Mr. Chestnut.
9            MR. CHESTNUT:  Members of the jury, you went
10       through the r√©sum√© of this doctor.  He has not
11       published, has not printed, has not dedicated any
12       time to tobacco-related diseases, unlike our
13       doctor, who came in and has extensive history in
14       the effects of smoking on the heart.  This doctor
15       has no publishing.
16            MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.  That
17       does misstate the evidence.
18            THE COURT:  Sustained.
19            MR. CHESTNUT:  I'd invite you to review his
20       r√©sum√©.  Credibility of evidence, ladies and
21       gentlemen.  If you recall, when the doctor started,
22       Dr. W., he says, first of all, most importantly, he
23       doesn't even -- he did not even do his PowerPoint.
24       The attorneys did it.  Which is why there were so
25       many conflicts when we started going through  slides, if you recall.
2            First he was adamant that COPD was the only
3       cause of death for Mr. Cavalier.  By the end of his
4       cross-examination, he had to agree that there were
5       other causes of death for Mr. Cavalier.
6            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  That
7       misstates.
8            MR. CHESTNUT:  He did agree, Your Honor.  He
9       specifically listed other causes.
10            THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  It's
11       an inference.  Go ahead.
12            MR. CHESTNUT:  He alleges that -- the doctor
13       says that Mr. Cavalier was getting better, that his
14       EF, ejection fraction, had been resolved.  Then he
15       had to retreat from that word "resolved."  He said
16       it got better.
17            Yesterday they presented in their argument
18       ejection fractions, saying that it was the same.
19       They're in conflict with their own doctor because
20       their doctor didn't do his own homework.  They
21       produced the PowerPoints for him, which is why he
22       couldn't back it up.  So when we presented him with
23       a discrepancy, "Was it lung cancer or COPD, because
24       you said your opinion that the only cause of death
25       is COPD," and it's based off the death certificate,  and we showed him inaccuracies in the death
2       certificate, and he said, "Well, it's based off of
3       Dr. Cowen."  Dr. Cowen, in 2008, said lung cancer
4       is too.  So he would agree that Dr. Cowen also
5       concurs that there are multi issues, that there are
6       many issues causing Mr. Cavalier's death.
7            All this time, he doesn't even call and talk
8       to Dr. Cowen to corroborate it, but he comes here
9       wanting you to accept his opinions as true, but he
10       didn't validate them.  He didn't do his homework.
11       He didn't do his research.  He just gave the
12       script.
13            Ladies and gentlemen, that is not credible.
14            THE CLERK:  Five minutes, Counsel.
15            MR. CHESTNUT:  Thank you.
16            Let's go to 3.  Members of the jury, lie,
17       deny, and blame the smoker.
18            So you've heard a lot of testimony about
19       choice, that Mr. Cavalier chose not to quit.  Well,
20       what about R.J.R.'s choices?  What could they have
21       chosen to do?  Could they have chosen to take some
22       of these poisonous, toxic cigarettes out of their
23       cigarette?  Could they have chosen to take the
24       nicotine out?
25            They presented you with warnings, ladies and  gentlemen.  Defies common sense for them to put a
2       board up with warnings that they say Mr. Cavalier
3       would have when it's been well-established
4       throughout, ladies and gentlemen, he could not
5       read.  They could have informed the public of these
6       issues, and so now, they say, well, now today
7       smoking is down 66 percent, smoking is the lowest
8       in Florida.  It is, because now people know what
9       they are signing up for, but in the 1930s and '40s,
10       in the 1920s, they didn't know.  When Mr. Cavalier
11       was a youth, a teenager, they were targeting him to
12       addict him for life.  We showed those documents.
13       When he went to war, R.J.R. Reynolds --
14            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  No
15       evidence.
16            MR. CHESTNUT:  There is no evidence he went to
17       war, sir?
18            THE COURT:  No.  Overruled.  You may continue,
19       Mr. Chestnut.
20            MR. CHESTNUT:  When he went to war, R.J.
21       Reynolds didn't go to war, R.J. sent cigarettes to
22       the soldiers.  He didn't pick up a gun.  He
23       provided them cigarettes to get the solders
24       addicted so when they came back they would be
25       clients. MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  There's
2       no evidence.
3            THE COURT:  Overruled.
4            MR. CHESTNUT:  Choice.  We showed you the
5       documents.  Choice is part of their strategy from
6       day one.  So when they tell you this case isn't
7       about --
8            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
9            MR. CHESTNUT:  When R.J. Reynolds
10       represents --
11            MR. PERSONS:  Attacking the defense.
12            THE COURT:  Denied -- I'll sustain that
13       objection, but Mr. Chestnut clarified it, so you
14       may proceed, Mr. Chestnut.
15            MR. PERSONS:  Motion, Your Honor.
16            THE COURT:  Denied.
17            MR. CHESTNUT:  May I continue?
18            THE COURT:  Yes, of course, Mr. Chestnut.
19            MR. CHESTNUT:  Okay.  Members of the jury, the
20       choice is yours.  The entire defense, the entire
21       assault on Mr. Cavalier's choice to quit, defies
22       common sense.  We have shown, doctors have
23       testified, he was chemically addicted.  Nicotine is
24       designed to freebase to your brain.  Some people
25       are immune to it.  Some people can't beat it.  He's  one of these people.
2            The choice is yours to sift through all of the
3       distractions and get down to the one thing that
4       really matters.  The one issue is "a" versus "the,"
5       and that jury instruction, did coronary artery
6       disease -- is that a legal cause of Mr. Cavalier's
7       death?  Absolutely.  Did cigarettes cause it?
8       Well, all the evidence shows that it did.  They
9       didn't produce you any studies -- they didn't
10       produce you one study or any medical evidence or
11       any doctor that says smoking doesn't cause coronary
12       artery disease.  They didn't show you one study
13       that says coronary artery disease is not fatal.  It
14       can be, but they didn't show you anything that says
15       definitively it is not.
16            So if we have the greater weight of the
17       evidence, which we do, that coronary artery disease
18       was a cause of death for Mr. Cavalier, in 1993, we
19       prevail, ladies and gentlemen, and we go to the
20       second phase of this trial.
21            Here's --
22            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's a
23       misstatement of law.
24            THE COURT:  Sustained.
25            MR. CHESTNUT:  Here's the testimony of Dr. W.  There was no autopsy or no pathology, which means
2       there was no autopsy on Mr. Cavalier.
3            "Now, we can agree that the date of death
4       Mr. Cavalier had lung cancer, correct?"
5            Dr. W.:  "Yes."
6            "Not only did he have lung cancer, but he had
7       cardiovascular decease, correct?"
8            Dr. W.:  "Correct."
9            "All right.  So those could have been put
10       there, correct?"
11            "Yes."
12            Which means they could -- could we publish
13       C-1?
14            So their doctor, their expert, agrees --
15            THE COURT:  Mr. Chestnut, you need to wrap up.
16       I'll give you a few minutes if you need to.
17            MR. CHESTNUT:  -- that cardiovascular disease
18       should have been here, that COPD is here,
19       cardiovascular disease and lung cancer should be
20       here.  He says that.  I just read the testimony, he
21       says, "Correct."
22            "What does that mean?"
23            MR. PERSONS:  Objection.
24            MR. HOHNBAUM:  If he's going to read, we'll
25       read the whole thing. THE COURT:  That's fine.  We're getting close
2       to wrapping up.
3            MR. CHESTNUT:  So here's the point, ladies and
4       gentlemen.  The irony that they would spend so much
5       time on Dr. W., because I doubt they would ever
6       hire him again because he --
7            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
8            THE COURT:  Sustained.
9            MR. CHESTNUT:  He gave up the case here,
10       ladies and gentlemen, because he said that
11       cardiovascular disease, if this were filled out
12       correctly, should be here on line 2.
13            MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection.  That completely
14       misstates the evidence.
15            MR. CHESTNUT:  It did not.  I read the --
16            THE COURT:  That's fine.  Why don't you just
17       read the transcript and then draw the inference.
18            MR. PERSONS:  That's not the transcript.
19            MR. HOHNBAUM:  That's not what he said, not
20       what he testified.
21            THE COURT:  No speaking objections.  No
22       speaking objections.
23            MR. CHESTNUT:  They're confused.  They are
24       always confused.  So here we go.
25            "Okay.  Now, we can agree that the date of  death of Mr. Cavalier he had lung cancer, correct?"
2            "Yes."
3            "And not only did he have lung cancer, he
4       had cardiovascular disease, correct?"
5            "Correct."
6            "All right.  So those could have been" -- C-1-
7       "those could have been put here, correct?"
8            C-1.
9            At that time, I was pointing here.  We all saw
10       it.  The jury instruction, ladies and gentleman,
11       does not say "the cause," it says "a cause," so
12       although they spent a lot of time parading this
13       death certificate, their own expert says
14       cardiovascular disease should have been there,
15       which means it is a cause of death, which means on
16       the verdict form the check is yes --
17            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you,
18       Mr. Chestnut.
19            MR. CHESTNUT: -- that this is the cause.
20            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Chestnut, you are
21       out of time.
22            MR. CHESTNUT:  Lies, deny, and blame the
23       victim, that's their strategy.  It's been their
24       strategy since 1955 at the Plaza Hotel --
25            MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Overruled.
2            MR. CHESTNUT:  -- R.J. Reynolds.  Thank you.
