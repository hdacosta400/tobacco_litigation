10           MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
11           Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  As you
12      know, my name is Bill Geraghty, and along with
13      Terry Sexton, we represent Philip Morris USA in
14      this case.  I think I can agree with Mr. Hammer,
15      it has been a long trial, and at times I'm sure
16      it was probably tedious and the examinations,
17      I'm sure, took longer than you all would have
18      liked for them to take, but we are toward
19      the end of the process.
20           What I'd really like to start with is to
21      thank you for your time.  This has been an
22      incredible sacrifice of your time to be here and
23      everybody appreciates the fact that you've taken
24      that time to help us to resolve the issues in
25      this case.  We wouldn't be able to have civil jury trials if we didn't have people like you
2      who are willing to make a sacrifice of your time
3      to be here and help us resolve this case.  Let
4      me simply say I think on behalf of everyone,
5      Judge Cox, the lawyers and the parties, that we
6      really appreciate it.  We know you've been
7      paying attention.  So thank you very much.
8           We are getting very close to the end of the
9      case, which I'm sure is music to all of your
10      ears at this point.  It is almost time for you
11      to head off to the jury room and deliberate.
12           Judge Cox told you that she will give you
13      an actual verdict form and a set of instructions
14      and you'll use that to decide the issues in this
15      case.  But before you head off to deliberate,
16      I'd like to take this opportunity to summarize
17      the evidence that we've heard over the last two
18      weeks.
19           Now before I do that, let me say something
20      about the findings from the earlier class
21      action.  You heard about those findings.  I am
22      not here to debate those findings.  But there's
23      also no debate, ladies and gentlemen, those
24      findings do not tell you how to answer any of
25      the questions on the verdict form. That's because, by your verdict in this
2      case, by your review of the evidence you've
3      heard and your verdict in this case, you decide
4      whether those findings have any applicability to
5      Fannie Collar and the lifestyle choices that she
6      made.
7           MR. HAMMER:  Objection.  That's a
8      misstatement of the law.  Can we approach?
9           THE COURT:  Yes.
10           (Thereupon, the bench conference proceeded
11      as follows.)
12           MR. HAMMER:  Judge, once the jury
13      determines she is a class member, those findings
14      absolutely do apply to Fannie Collar.  That's a
15      misstatement of the law.
16           THE COURT:  I thought it said --
17           MR. HAMMER:  It's a misstatement of the
18      law.  I'd ask for a curative instruction.
19           THE COURT:  If so, sustained.
20           MR. HAMMER:  I'd ask for a curative.
21           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, you told them in
22      your instructions that they can't use the
23      findings to decide whether she's a class member
24      or not.
25           THE COURT:  Right.  That is true. GERAGHTY:  Right.  So they get to
2      decide by answering that question whether the
3      findings apply to her.
4           THE COURT:  Then you need to say that
5      instead of what you just said, that the
6      findings, based on her lifestyle.
7           MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't want to get
8      interrupted every two minutes.  All he has to do
9      is object.  I came up once during his.
10           MR. HAMMER:  It's a misstatement of the
11      law.
12           MR. GERAGHTY:  It's not a misstatement of
13      the law.
14           THE COURT:  You object, and I'll overrule.
15      You don't need to run up here.
16           MR. HAMMER:  If it's a misstatement of the
17      law, I'm asking for a curative instruction.
18      What Mr. Geraghty said is that the findings have
19      no applicability to Fannie Collar.
20           MR. GERAGHTY:  That's not what I said.
21           MR. HAMMER:  That is untrue.
22           MR. GERAGHTY:  That's not what I said.
23           THE COURT:  That's not what he said.
24           MR. GERAGHTY:  I said, you decide by your
25      verdict whether those findings have any applicability.  If they decide she's not a
2      member of the class --
3           MR. HAMMER:  Look at the transcript.
4      That's not what he said.
5           THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection and
6      instruct the jury.
7 8           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, as I told
9      you earlier in the trial, the attorneys do not
10      give testimony.  The testimony in evidence comes
11      only from the witness stand and the evidence.
12      The attorneys' arguments are intended to aid you
13      in understanding the evidence and testimony.
14           You may proceed with your argument.
15           MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you.  After all,
16      ladies and gentlemen, this case is about Fannie
17      Collar.  When I spoke to you during my opening
18      statement, which was about two weeks ago, I told
19      you that the plaintiff would spend a lot of her
20      time talking to you about statements and ideas
21      made by Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and
22      Liggett, many of which were made, 30, 40 and in
23      some instances more than 50 years ago.
24           We told you we would not try to defend all
25      those statements.  Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and Liggett made statements and had ideas that
2      today no one would say or think.
3           But I also told you that if that was all
4      this case were about, if all the plaintiff had
5      to prove was that cigarette company executives
6      said inappropriate things, we wouldn't be here.
7           We wouldn't have spent the last two weeks
8      together in this courtroom, but we did, ladies
9      and gentlemen.  We did that because this case
10      isn't about all cigarette smokers.  It's not
11      about whether we think people should or should
12      not smoke cigarettes.
13           This case is about Fannie Collar.  It's
14      about her life and her decisions.  That's why,
15      when you actually get the verdict form, you will
16      see that every question on that verdict form
17      asks you specifically about Fannie Collar, not
18      all cigarette smokers and not the general
19      public.
20           So what have you heard in this case over
21      the last two weeks that is undisputed?  Well,
22      you've heard that Fannie Collar is well
23      educated, intelligent, strong-willed and
24      independent.  She chose to live her life the way
25      she wanted.  Her attitude about smoking was no different.
2           As far back as 1955, when Fannie Collar was
3      21 years old and working at the adjutant
4      general's office, her attitude was, it's not
5      going to happen to me.  I'm going to live until
6      I'm in my 80s.  I'm not going to slow down until
7      I'm in my 80s.
8           This is what Fannie Collar told her
9      co-worker back in 1955 when that co-worker told
10      her, you know what, you should quit smoking.  My
11      wife, she smoked cigarettes and she died of
12      cancer.  This is what Fannie Collar told that
13      co-worker back in 1955 at the age of 21.
14           Now, we're going to walk through all of the
15      cigarette events in Ms. Collar's life because
16      this case is about her.  I will show you that
17      everything we told you, everything we told you
18      about Ms. Collar at the very beginning of the
19      case, has turned out to be true.
20           I talked to you at the very beginning of
21      the case about the sources of evidence, the
22      sources of evidence.  I asked you to pay close
23      attention to those sources of evidence.  So what
24      did I mean by that?  What I meant was that
25      everything you saw during the course of this trial came from either what Ms. Collar herself
2      told us in her deposition, what she told her
3      doctors in her medical records, many of which
4      were written long before the lawsuit was filed,
5      what her doctors told us, and what her family
6      members said, who also gave depositions under
7      oath in this case.
8           As I told you in my opening statement two
9      weeks ago, many of the things that Ms. Collar
10      told us during the course of this trial have
11      been contradicted by what she told her own
12      doctors and her medical records many years
13      before she filed the lawsuit, by what she said
14      in her own deposition in this case under oath
15      and by what her own family members told us in
16      their depositions.
17           I told you that you would get to be the
18      judge of the facts.  You would get to be the
19      judges of the facts in this case.  You would get
20      to decide what testimony you ultimately chose to
21      believe.  Judge Cox gave you this instruction.
22      She read it to you, but you'll get a written
23      copy of the instruction when you retire to
24      deliberate.  Judge Cox has already told you that
25      in evaluating the believability of any witness you may properly consider any interest the
2      witness may have in the outcome of the case.  By
3      "interest," we mean a financial interest in the
4      outcome of the case.
5           You may consider the reasonableness of the
6      testimony of the witness considered in the light
7      of all of the evidence in the case and in light
8      of your own experience and common sense.
9           You can accept or reject any testimony
10      you're hearing in this case in whole or in part.
11      Ladies and gentlemen, that is your job and your
12      job alone as the jury.
13           Let me tell you the best example of when
14      Ms. Collar told you one thing here in court, but
15      said something completely different when she
16      wasn't thinking about this lawsuit.  You'll
17      probably recall that Ms. Collar told you about
18      an episode in which she claimed that she nearly
19      drowned in her pool.  She said it was scary and
20      she hasn't been swimming ever since.
21           On Thursday, when I asked Ms. Collar about
22      it, she confirmed that this episode happened
23      sometime before her deposition, which was on
24      April 15th of 2014.  Let me remind you of the
25      testimony that Ms. Collar gave.  This was last Thursday.  I was asking the questions.
2           Does that refresh your recollection that
3      the first time you told us about this episode
4      where you nearly drowned in the pool was on
5      April 15th of 2014?
6           Her answer was:  Yes, but that wasn't the
7      day that the episode happened.
8           And then I said to her:  I understand that.
9      The episode occurred before you told us about it
10      on April 15th of 2014, right?
11           She said:  Right.
12           That's what she said.
13           Two months after Ms. Collar told us about
14      this on April 15th, her medical records showed
15      that she was swimming in her pool again.
16           So I asked Ms. Collar right after this, I
17      asked her these questions.
18           Minutes later, isn't it true that
19      approximately two months after you told us about
20      this episode where you nearly drowned, that you
21      were actually swimming in your pool?
22           Answer:  No.
23           Isn't that true?
24           Her answer:  No.
25           No, that's not true? Her answer:  No, that's not true.  I
2      haven't been in the pool.
3           That's the testimony that Ms. Collar gave
4      under oath from that witness box less than a
5      week ago.  That's what she told you.
6           Now, here is the medical record, ladies and
7      gentlemen.  I tried to show it to you during
8      Ms. Collar's examination.
9           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
10           THE COURT:  Sustained.
11           MR. GERAGHTY:  You actually saw this
12      medical record the day before Ms. Collar
13      testified.  I put it up on the screen and I
14      showed it to Dr. Mannino the day before.  Again,
15      this medical record, I'm going to show it to you
16      in a second, it's dated June 30th of 2014, two
17      and a half months after that date.
18           Can I have the Elmo, please?
19           So you can see real quick.
20           It says Barry Gordon.  He was a
21      chiropractor that was treating Ms. Collar for
22      neck and back pain.  It's got her name at the
23      top.  She came in about a week earlier, on
24      June 23rd, complaining of neck and back pain.
25           Let's look at what Ms. Collar told Dr. Gordon on June 30th of 2014.  It says,
2      patient reports that she is better.  She states
3      that she was able to swim over this past
4      weekend, where she had not been able to swim
5      before.
6           That's what Ms. Collar told her doctor.
7      That's what she told her doctor when she wasn't
8      thinking about the lawsuit.
9           It contradicted what she told you from this
10      witness stand when she swore to tell the truth.
11      The testimony you heard less than one week ago.
12      When I handed the record to Ms. Collar, she
13      said, where did you get this?
14           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
15           THE COURT:  Overruled.
16           MR. GERAGHTY:  So what else did Ms. Collar
17      tell you?
18           Well, she said in 1966 she heard a
19      statement from the tobacco industry that if you
20      were concerned about your health, you should
21      smoke filtered cigarettes because they were
22      safe, absolutely safe.  That's what she told
23      you.
24           But you already know that by this time
25      Ms. Collar had been smoking filtered cigarettes, filtered Marlboro cigarette for nearly 10 years,
2      going back to 1955, when she met and married her
3      now ex-husband, Merton Collar.
4           What did she tell you about this statement
5      that she claims she heard?  She said it didn't
6      make any impression on me because I had already
7      been smoking filtered cigarettes for 10 or 11
8      years.
9           I'll show you the testimony.  This is
10      Ms. Collar's testimony.  This was Thursday
11      afternoon as well.
12           Isn't it true that the statement that you
13      have now told us about several times, isn't it
14      true that that statement didn't make any
15      impression on you because you were already
16      smoking filtered cigarettes at the time you
17      claim you heard this statement?
18           Her answer was:  Right.
19           Right.  So you had already been smoking
20      filtered Marlboro cigarettes for years before
21      you ever heard this statement that you've been
22      telling us about for the better part of the day;
23      isn't that right?
24           And then her answer:  The first time I
25      heard about it was in 1966. Eleven years after she told you she started
2      smoking filtered cigarettes, when she met and
3      married her husband.
4           Now, you know that the very next day, this
5      was Thursday, the very next day, Friday morning
6      after she had an opportunity to go home, to
7      think about her testimony, to consult with her
8      lawyers.
9           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  That's
10      totally improper.
11           THE COURT:  Sustained.
12           MR. HAMMER:  I would ask for a curative
13      instruction.
14           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you're
15      not to consider the only -- only the testimony
16      in evidence of the witnesses and exhibits not
17      the arguments of the attorneys.  If you'll
18      disregard the last statement.
19           MR. GERAGHTY:  You know that the very next
20      day after she made this statement under oath on
21      Thursday afternoon, Ms. Collar went home, had
22      the opportunity to think about her testimony.
23      And when she came back on Friday morning, she
24      said, well, you know, I was wrong when I said
25      this.  I actually heard this statement sometime in the 1950s.  That's what she said the very
2      next day.
3           Are you surprised that she changed her
4      testimony when she came back the next day?
5           Ms. Collar wants you to believe that this
6      statement she claims she heard caused her to
7      ignore all of the warnings about the dangers of
8      smoking that she received in the 1950s, 1960s,
9      1970s, 1980s, 1990s, right on up to the present.
10           Ladies and gentlemen, that story is not
11      plausible.  Because who can rely on a statement
12      in 1954 or 1955 when you don't hear the
13      statement until 1966?
14           Who can rely on a statement like this when
15      you hear over and over and over and over again
16      from people in your life that the filtered
17      cigarettes you're smoking are going to cause you
18      to develop lung cancer and COPD?
19           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  No evidence
20      of that in this case.
21           MR. GERAGHTY:  Ladies and gentlemen, think
22      about this.
23           THE COURT:  Overruled.
24           MR. GERAGHTY:  You heard Dr. Proctor
25      testify, he was here for several days.  Given what you know about Dr. Proctor, the number of
2      times he's testified, the amount of money he's
3      been paid, don't you think if there was a
4      specific statement, a specific statement that
5      supported what Ms. Collar told you, that
6      Dr. Proctor would have showed it to you?
7           After all, he told you there are 80 to
8      85 million pages of documents and videos from
9      the tobacco company files, all word searchable
10      he told you.
11           We asked Fannie Collar did you ever discuss
12      this statement, this statement you claim you
13      heard about filters with your family, with your
14      husband, Merton Collar, with your foster sister,
15      Christine Coffin, with any of your doctors, with
16      anyone?  Every single time she said no, she
17      never discussed the statement with anyone, not
18      one single person.
19           Why not?  Because the truth is and the
20      evidence you've now heard shows that the very
21      first time that Fannie Collar ever told anybody
22      that she heard a statement from the industry
23      that filters make cigarettes safe was after she
24      filed this lawsuit in which she is now asking
25      you to award her $15 million. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  Misstates
2      the evidence.
3           THE COURT:  Overruled.
4           MR. GERAGHTY:  Ladies and gentlemen, you
5      did not leave your common sense outside that
6      door when you came here two weeks ago.
7           Judge Cox told you you can use your common
8      sense and your personal life experiences to
9      decide whether or not you are going to believe
10      the things that Ms. Collar tried to tell you.
11           Two weeks ago when I gave my opening
12      statement, I told you this case was about two
13      words:  Control and responsibility.  I asked you
14      as you listened to the evidence to ask yourself
15      the following series of questions, and we're
16      going to walk through all of the significant
17      events in Ms. Collar's life here in a moment.  I
18      would ask you again to just ask yourself these
19      questions as you listen to the summary of the
20      evidence.
21           Who was in control of Ms. Collar's
22      lifestyle choices?  Who was in control of her
23      decision to smoke cigarettes?  Who was in
24      control of Ms. Collar's efforts to quit smoking?
25      Who controlled her motivation to quit?  Was Ms. Collar addicted?  If so, was she someone
2      whose addiction was so strong, so substantial
3      that it overpowered her ability to quit smoking?
4      And finally, ask yourself, did Ms. Collar rely
5      on anything that Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds or
6      Liggett said or failed to say about the health
7      risks of smoking?
8           After hearing all the evidence in this
9      case, ladies and gentlemen, you now know Fannie
10      Collar wasn't paying attention to anything
11      cigarette companies were saying.  She wasn't
12      waiting for Philip Morris to tell her, smoking
13      is dangerous, you need to quit.  Fannie Collar
14      and only Fannie Collar was making those
15      decisions in her life.  There is no dispute.
16      She is intelligent.  She is well educated.  She
17      is strong-willed and independent.  She didn't
18      listen to what anyone told her about the dangers
19      of smoking.  That's what the evidence is you've
20      heard.
21           Ms. Collar wants you to believe that she
22      smoked for 35 years thinking that by having a
23      filter on the cigarette it was absolutely safe.
24      That's what she told you.
25           But the undisputed evidence is in 1955, her co-worker told her, you should quit smoking
2      because my wife, my wife smoked and she
3      developed cancer.
4           In 1957, her own foster father, Raymond
5      Dowd, a heavy smoker, dies of cancer.  She was
6      caring for him in the last months of his life.
7           Throughout the decade of the 1950s, her
8      ex-husband Merton Collar was preaching to her
9      about the dangers of smoking.
10           In 1964, her foster sister, Christine
11      Coffin quits smoking when the Surgeon General's
12      report is released.
13           In 1966, her father-in-law, he quit smoking
14      when the first warning label goes on cigarette
15      packs.  He shows it to her.  Ladies and
16      gentlemen, the list goes on and on and on.
17           Did Fannie Collar listen to any of these
18      warnings?  These warnings came from people that
19      she loved, that she respected, that she trusted.
20           You already know the answer to the
21      question.  Of course Ms. Collar didn't listen.
22      She continued smoking no matter what anyone told
23      her.  She was the kind of person that was going
24      to smoke no matter what anyone said to her.
25      That's why she told the co-worker back in 1955, it's not going to happen to me.  I'm going to
2      live until I'm in my 80s, and I'm not slowing
3      down until I'm in my 80s.
4           When her husband, Merton Collar, said
5      Fannie, you shouldn't smoke.  What did she tell
6      her own husband?  Mind your own business.  It's
7      my decision whether or not I smoke.  That's what
8      she told her own husband.
9           After hearing all the evidence, you know
10      that Fannie Collar has chosen to live her life
11      the way she wanted.  Her attitude about
12      cigarette smoking was no different.  The truth
13      is Ms. Collar did enjoy smoking cigarettes.  For
14      many years, she was simply not interested in
15      quitting.  She enjoyed smoking.  Cigarettes
16      relaxed her.  They helped her focus and
17      concentrate.  They helped her cope with stress
18      in her life.
19           Every single expert you heard from in this
20      case told you people find cigarette smoking and
21      the effects of nicotine to be pleasurable.  They
22      release dopamine.  It makes you feel good.  So
23      why do you think Ms. Collar said -- she just
24      denied, didn't want to admit that she enjoyed
25      smoking. Of course, ladies and gentlemen, you heard
2      that when Ms. Collar was finally motivated to
3      stop smoking in 1993, she quit for 13 or 14
4      years with no cravings and no urges to smoke.
5      That's what she told you.
6           The truth is Ms. Collar could have quit
7      smoking any time she wanted to.  Frankly, ladies
8      and gentlemen, you heard that from the very
9      first witness who testified.  You may not
10      recall, but it was Dr. Suen, Ms. Collar's own
11      treating pulmonologist, from right here in Vero
12      Beach.  You saw his testimony by videotape.  We
13      took his deposition in the case.
14           What did Dr. Suen tell you?  This is
15      Dr. Suen's testimony from two weeks ago on
16      Tuesday.
17           If a smoker is not well motivated, in your
18      experience, is there any likelihood that the
19      smoker will successfully quit smoking?
20           Dr. Suen said:  It's very much less likely
21      if they're not motivated.
22           Question:  Nobody can do it for you, in
23      other words?
24           His answer:  Right.
25           Question:  Would you agree that Ms. Collar quit when she was sufficiently motivated to do
2      so?
3           I believe so, yes.
4           That's from Dr. Suen.  He's been treating
5      her since 1993.  He probably knows her better
6      than anybody you heard from during the course of
7      this entire trial.  He has no interest in the
8      outcome of this case.  He told you Fannie Collar
9      quit smoking when she was motivated to do so.
10           Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, that's all
11      you really need to know to decide the issues in
12      this case.
13           In this country we have the right to make
14      decisions for ourselves, even decisions that
15      today with the benefit of hindsight we might all
16      say were not in her best interests.
17           We believe in free will.  That is a
18      fundamental principle upon which our country was
19      founded.  You do have the right to make your own
20      decisions in life.  But with that right comes
21      the obligation to accept personal responsibility
22      for the consequences of those actions and those
23      decisions.
24           You haven't heard anything, any evidence in
25      this case that nicotine somehow robbed Fannie Collar of her free will.  No evidence.
2           You saw her testify on the stand.  She is
3      an intelligent, well-educated and strong-willed
4      person.
5           Now, let me take one more moment and talk
6      about the burden of proof.  You've seen medical
7      records.  You've heard testimony for the last
8      two weeks.  Fannie Collar bears the burden to
9      prove by the greater weight of the evidence all
10      of her claims in this case.  So what does that
11      mean?
12           It means that Ms. Collar and her attorneys
13      were required to bring you more persuasive, more
14      convincing evidence than the mountain of
15      evidence, the literal mountain of evidence that
16      we've presented during the course of the last
17      two weeks that demonstrates that Ms. Collar was
18      always in control, that she was not some
19      hopeless addict, and that addiction was not the
20      legal cause of her disease.
21           We're going to walk through the significant
22      events in her life in just a minute.  And as we
23      do that, you will see that the plaintiff has
24      simply failed to carry her burden of proof in
25      this case. That's what you have seen over the last two
2      weeks.
3           So let me show you the timeline.
4      Everything on the timeline are things you've
5      heard about during the course of the evidence
6      over the last two weeks.  Let me kind of orient
7      you here for a second.  The timeline of events
8      in Ms. Collar's life, can everybody see that?
9           Everything above this blue bar here in the
10      middle, these are all things that occurred in
11      Ms. Collar's life.  Everything below the blue
12      bar are things that occurred here in the United
13      States with respect to cigarette smoking and
14      health.
15           So let's start at the very beginning.  You
16      heard that Fannie Collar was born in 1934 in
17      Waterville, Maine.  She was raised by loving
18      foster parents.  Her foster father, Raymond
19      Dowd, was a funeral director and owned a general
20      store.  Her mother was a homemaker.  You heard
21      her mother was very strict.  Her mother set the
22      rules, and she expected her children to follow
23      the rules.
24           Now, Mr. Hammer said, I heard Mr. Hammer
25      say, that cigarette companies hid the fact that cigarette smoking could be addictive and could
2      cause disease for more than 50 years, and people
3      in this country had no idea that cigarette
4      smoking could be dangerous or addictive.
5           Well, based on the evidence you heard over
6      the course of the last two weeks, you know that
7      simply isn't true, and it's certainly not true
8      as far as Fannie Collar is concerned.
9           Long before Fannie Collar was born, you
10      heard Dr. Proctor testify, Dr. Proctor told you
11      that cigarette smoking, tobacco use and smoking
12      was associated with lip, mouth and oral cancer
13      going back to the 1700s and 1800s.  That's not
14      even on the timeline here.  Not even on the
15      timeline.
16           He told you that as far back as the 1850s
17      and 1860s people were smoking roll-your-own
18      cigarettes.  They were inhaling those cigarettes
19      and they were addictive, just like cigarettes
20      told today.  That's what Dr. Proctor told you.
21           He told you in 1899 the state of Florida
22      banned the sale of cigarettes.  Banned the sale
23      of cigarettes in 1899 in part because they were
24      considered to be dangerous and addictive,
25      particularly to young people and women.  That's what Dr. Proctor told you.
2           If we could bring up the Florida Health
3      Notes real quick.  You saw the Florida Health
4      Notes -- this is Florida Health Notes.  I showed
5      this to Dr. Proctor during my examination.  The
6      date is July 1906 to June 1907.  More than 100
7      years ago the Florida Department of Health said
8      that today the cigarette is looked upon by all
9      smokers as a very worse form of tobacco
10      addiction.  That's in 1907.
11           You heard if we go back, well over 100
12      years ago, people in this country were referring
13      to cigarettes as coffin nails and cancer sticks.
14      They were saying that people had nicotine fits,
15      and smokers were nicotine feigns.  These were
16      terms that were being used in this country well
17      over 100 years ago.
18           So it's no surprise, ladies and gentlemen,
19      when we get to the late '40s and early 1950s
20      Fannie Collar told you she heard "coffin nails"
21      used as a term to refer to cigarettes.  She
22      heard cigarettes referred to as "cancer sticks."
23      She described herself as having nicotine fits
24      back in the 1950s and 1960s.  That's what she
25      told you.  She told you, I considered myself to be addicted as far back as the 1950s.  That
2      wasn't hidden from her.
3           Of course she did on the stand say, well,
4      coffin nails, cancer sticks, I just thought
5      those were old wives' tales.  But this was
6      someone educated as a nurse.  And she told you,
7      I never bothered to ask anybody.  That's what
8      Ms. Collar told you.
9           As we move into the '30s and 1940s, you
10      heard that there are articles published in
11      magazines, including Reader's Digest, that
12      discuss the health risks and addictive nature of
13      smoking.  I talked with Dr. Proctor about some
14      of those.
15           Could we bring up the next one, please?
16           Reader's Digest, November 1924, the article
17      is called "Does Tobacco Injure the Human Body?"
18      In 1924 tobacco was injurious to the human body.
19      Its use sometimes induces cancer.
20           Can you show us the next one from 1938?
21           Reader's Digest, August 1938, the article
22      is "So You're Going to Stop Smoking?"  Here is
23      what it says.  "Sooner or later nearly every
24      cigarette smoker discovers that he is not
25      smoking by choice but by habit, and the habit is probably harmful. So he tries to break free from
2      it, but he find that he doesn't know how.
3      Sometimes halfheartedly, sometimes earnestly, he
4      wrestles with his addiction, but in vein.  His
5      self-control has been perilously undermined by a
6      mere mechanism of habit."
7           These are the kind of articles that were
8      being published in Reader's Digest magazine in
9      the 1920s, '30s and '40s, when Fannie Collar was
10      growing up.  She said her family had these
11      magazines in her home, and her father sold those
12      magazines out of his general store.
13           As we move into the early 1950s, you heard
14      about some of the scientific research that was
15      being published that specifically linked smoking
16      to lung cancer.  Dr. Proctor told you that these
17      studies made front page news in newspapers and
18      magazines all across the country.  He told you
19      that so widespread was this information that by
20      1954, 90 percent of the American public had
21      heard that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung
22      cancer.
23           This is one of the articles he showed you
24      from Life Magazine.  That famous story, "Smoke
25      Gets In The News," published December 21st, 1953.  They showed the mice getting cancer on
2      their backs.
3           I asked Dr. Proctor:  90 percent of the
4      people who were surveyed in June of 1954, about
5      six months after this study, said, yes, they had
6      read or heard that cigarette smoking may be a
7      cause of cancer of the lung.
8           His answer was:  That's right.
9           That was Dr. Proctor.
10           So let's move back up above the blue bar
11      here.  We're in this period of time.  You know
12      in the mid-1940s Fannie Collar's foster father,
13      brother and sister smoked cigarettes.  You know
14      that her mother hated smoking, and her mother
15      did not smoke.
16           Fannie Collar told you she tried cigarettes
17      for the first time in 1946 at the age of 12.
18      Her and her friend take a pack of cigarettes,
19      they split the entire pack.  She coughed.  She
20      was dizzy.  She was lightheaded.  She said it
21      was not pleasant.
22           Within a month or two after, her mother
23      caught her smoking a cigarette and slapped her
24      and told her, don't smoke.  Ms. Collar said that
25      was the only time her mother ever laid a hand on her.  While she continued to sneak cigarettes
2      here and there, she said she didn't do it very
3      often because she was concerned about being
4      caught by her mother.  That's what she told you.
5           In 1948, she attends an exclusive private
6      high school called The Erskine Academy.  You
7      heard that she was a very good student.  She was
8      on the honor roll.  She was in the nursing club.
9           That brings us to about 1952, when she
10      graduates from high school.  She wanted to
11      become a nurse.  You heard that she attends
12      nursing school.  Ms. Collar told you that when
13      she was in nursing school, what did she study?
14      Pharmacology, biology, chemistry.  She studied
15      the sciences.  She learned how to read and write
16      medical records.  She understood how to take
17      care of patients, administer drugs.  She learned
18      all of that while a nursing student at the age
19      of 18 and 19 years old in 1952 and 1953.
20           She then decides to attend business school,
21      and she graduates from a two-year business
22      program in just one year.
23           That's what she told you.
24           At this point she moves back in, she's
25      living with her parents in 1953 and 1954 and she says, I was smoking about two or three
2      cigarettes a day while I was driving back and
3      forth from my parents' home to Gates Business
4      College.
5           She's living with her mother.  She's not
6      smoking at all around her mother.  This is when
7      she's 18, 19 and 20 years old.
8           In 1955 -- we're going to move forward on
9      the timeline.  In 1955 she meets and marries her
10      husband, Merton Collar.  He's a cigarette smoker
11      too.  Mr. Collar is smoking Marlboro Red, a
12      filtered cigarette.  Ms. Collar said after they
13      got married, she switches from unfiltered Old
14      Gold cigarettes to her husband's filtered
15      Marlboro Red.
16           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  Misstates
17      the testimony.
18           MR. GERAGHTY:  I'll show you the testimony.
19           THE COURT:  Overruled.
20           MR. GERAGHTY:  This is Ms. Collar's
21      testimony.  This was on Friday, I believe.
22      Ms. Collar basically said, you know, I never
23      really bought cigarettes.  I simply smoked the
24      brands that the people I was living with bought.
25      She told you that was the pattern with her father.  That was the pattern with her husband,
2      Merton Collar, and that was later the pattern
3      with her boyfriend, Ben Sweeney.
4           Here is her testimony.
5           If you were living with somebody else and
6      they bought the cigarettes and you smoked what
7      they bought, true?
8           Her answer:  Pretty much.
9           All right.  And you let whoever was buying
10      the cigarettes chose the brand, correct?
11           Her answer:  Yes.
12           And you just smoked what the purchaser
13      smoked, right?
14           Most of the time, yes.
15           And you weren't going to complain about the
16      brand because the price was right?
17           Remember, she chuckled about that.  That
18      was her testimony.
19           So while Ms. Collar made the decision to
20      smoke, the evidence is clear that throughout her
21      entire life, she let other people choose the
22      brands of cigarettes she smoked.
23           She also told you:  Well, I remember that
24      at some point after I switched from the Old
25      Golds, I was only smoking about a half a pack. And at some point after I switched, I started
2      smoking a full pack of the Marlboro Red filtered
3      cigarettes.
4           She told you she remembered that.  She was
5      aware of that.
6           Dr. Proctor told you it's common sense.
7      Smoking two cigarettes is worse than one.
8      Smoking 20 cigarettes is worse than 10.
9           That's back in 1955.
10           We talked earlier about how Ms. Collar
11      claims that for 35 years she believed smoking
12      cigarettes was absolutely safe.  Well, here are
13      all of the things that people told her in the
14      1950s and in the 1960s.
15           In 1955 you heard about -- do you remember
16      the co-worker?  The co-worker says, hey, you
17      should quit smoking.  My wife quit -- excuse me.
18      My wife smoked, and she died of lung cancer.  I
19      don't want the same thing to happen to you.
20           That's what her co-worker told her.
21           Let me just show you that testimony.  This
22      was on Thursday.  When her co-worker told her,
23      you know what, you should quit smoking or you're
24      going to end up like my wife, this is when she
25      said -- you said to him, it's not going to happen to me.
2           Her answer:  Right.
3           You said, you know what, I'm going to live
4      until I'm in my 80s.
5           That's right.  I did say that.  I remember
6      now.
7           Initially, Ms. Collar didn't recall this,
8      but when I asked her about it, she said it
9      jogged her memory.
10           You said, I'm not going to slow down until
11      I'm in my 80s, right?
12           Right.
13           This was in 1955?
14           Right.
15           That was Ms. Collar's testimony under oath
16      on Thursday.
17           Around the same period of time you heard
18      that her husband, Merton Collar, is telling her
19      the same thing from the moment they met in 1955.
20           Plaintiff's own expert, Dr. Niaura, told
21      you, Dr. Niaura told that you Merton Collar
22      preached to his wife about the dangers of
23      smoking.  That's what Dr. Niaura told you.
24           Ms. Collar would tell him, mind your own
25      business.  It's my decision whether or not I smoke.
2           Here is Dr. Niaura's testimony.  This was
3      Mr. Sexton was asking the questions, as you may
4      recall.
5           And when Mr. Collar would preach to
6      Ms. Collar in the 1950s to quit smoking, she
7      would tell him to mind his own business; isn't
8      that right?
9           Answer:  Yes.
10           Ms. Collar told Mr. Collar when he was
11      preaching about the dangers of smoking that
12      smoking was her decision?
13           Her answer:  Yes.
14           That was her answer.
15           But just two days after Dr. Niaura
16      testified, Dr. Niaura testified I believe it was
17      on Tuesday to this, two days later, on Thursday,
18      Ms. Collar got on the stand and she said none of
19      this is true.  None of this is true.
20           She said her husband never preached to her
21      about the health risks of smoking, and she never
22      told him to, mind your own business.
23           Think about it, ladies and gentlemen.
24      Dr. Niaura is Ms. Collar's own expert.  You
25      heard him tell you that Ms. Collar's lawyers gave him all of the depositions of all of the
2      witnesses in the case so he would be in a
3      position to talk to you about her.  Dr. Niaura
4      read Merton Collar's deposition, and he told you
5      that this is what Merton Collar said in his
6      deposition under oath.
7           Ms. Collar came in two days later and said
8      none of it is true.
9           Don't you think that if what Ms. Collar,
10      what Fannie Collar was trying to tell you was
11      true, and not what Dr. Niaura here said under
12      oath, which I've put on the board, don't you
13      think Merton Collar would have come in here and
14      said --
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
5           MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
6           Plaintiff's counsel gave Dr. Niaura all of
7      the depositions in the case.  Dr. Niaura told
8      you he read those depositions.  He told you that
9      Merton Collar said, I preached to my wife that
10      she needed to quit smoking as far back as the
11      '50s.  She responded to him, mind your own
12      business.  It's my decision whether or not I
13      smoke.  Dr. Niaura told you that.
14           Ms. Collar took the stand two days later
15      and told you that what her own expert said, her
16      own expert who had read all of the depositions,
17      was wrong.  Dr. Niaura was right.  What
18      Ms. Collar told you on the stand when she denied
19      all of this, that was not the truth.  Not the
20      truth.
21           Later that same year -- we're moving
22      forward here -- you heard her father, Raymond
23      Dowd, a long-time, heavy smoker is diagnosed
24      with cancer and passes away.  So despite going
25      to nursing school and learning the sciences, despite what her husband told her, despite what
2      her co-worker told her, Ms. Collar told you, you
3      know, the idea that cigarette smoking might have
4      been associated with my father's cancer never
5      crossed my mind.  It just never crossed my mind.
6           But, ladies and gentlemen, all you need to
7      do, all you need to do is look at Ms. Collar's
8      own actions.  She told you that within a few
9      years of all of these events happening in the
10      late 1950s, she says, for a period of time I
11      switched from smoking filtered cigarettes to a
12      lady's pipe.  She told you about the lady's
13      pipe.  She said, my brother, Eddie, told me that
14      pipe smokers don't actually inhale the smoke,
15      they hold the smoke in their mouth.
16           Why was Ms. Collar interested in switching
17      from cigarettes to a pipe?  Because, ladies and
18      gentlemen, she knew whether the cigarette had a
19      filter on it or not, that she was inhaling smoke
20      into her lungs and she knew that that could
21      cause lung cancer and other diseases.  That's
22      why she did it.
23           Actions speak louder than words.
24           So that brings us to 1964.  In January of
25      1964 you heard the Surgeon General of the United States issues a landmark report that says
2      cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and chronic
3      bronchitis, which is a form of COPD.  This is
4      1964.
5           We showed you -- this is in evidence.  This
6      is the front page of The Portland Sunday
7      Telegram on January 12, 1964.  "Cigarettes cause
8      cancer says report."
9           Ms. Collar told you her and her husband
10      were living in Portland, Maine, the day -- the
11      exact period of time when this report was
12      released and that newspaper article was
13      published.  That's what she told you.
14           We showed you Harry Reasoner and the
15      coverage from CBS News.  So, you know, every
16      American, including Fannie Collar, was told in
17      1964 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.
18           This was more than 50 years ago.  Almost 30
19      years before Ms. Collar was diagnosed with lung
20      cancer.
21           Dr. Proctor told you '64 was the turning
22      point, the beginning of the end of cigarettes in
23      this country.  That's what he told you from the
24      witness stand.
25           We showed him the chart.  I think Mr. Hammer actually showed the chart.  From 1964
2      there's been a steady decline in the number of
3      people smoking cigarettes in this country, to
4      the point where today, the percentage of people
5      who smoke, is what it was back in the early
6      1930s during the Great Depression.  That's what
7      Dr. Proctor told you.  Ms. Collar wants you to
8      believe that she was the only one who missed
9      this, the only one who missed this.
10           She was living in Portland, Maine, but she
11      said, well, we didn't really watch the news.  We
12      were probably snowshoeing at our summer cottage
13      by the lake.  That's what she told you.
14           We know one person who didn't miss this
15      story.  We know one person who didn't miss this
16      story.  That was her older foster sister,
17      Christine Coffin.  You heard in 1964, her older
18      sister, who she was very close with, who she
19      smoked cigarettes with, quit smoking when she
20      heard this news.  She quit smoking when she
21      heard this news.  They smoked cigarettes
22      together.  Of course they would have
23      naturally -- Ms. Collar would have said,
24      Christine, you're not smoking, why aren't you
25      smoking. HAMMER:  Objection.  Misstates the
2      evidence.
3           THE COURT:  Sustained.
4           MR. GERAGHTY:  It's a reasonable inference,
5      Your Honor, based on the evidence.
6           THE COURT:  Sustained.
7           MR. GERAGHTY:  All right.
8           Okay.  We know Ms. Collar didn't miss what
9      happened two years later in 1966.  You heard
10      that in 1966 when Ms. Collar was 31 years old,
11      Congress passes a law that requires that every
12      pack of cigarettes carry a warning label that
13      says "Caution, cigarette smoking may be
14      hazardous to your health."
15           Ms. Collar said, I was aware of this
16      warning label.  I saw it. I understood exactly
17      what it meant.  It didn't tell me anything I
18      didn't already know.
19           Here is her testimony.
20           Now, this warning label in 1966 didn't tell
21      you anything you didn't already know; isn't that
22      right?
23           Her answer was:  Right.
24           And we know that because her father-in-law,
25      a heavy cigarette smoker, her father-in-law, a heavy cigarette smoker, he shows her the warning
2      label and he told her, I'm going to quit.  This
3      says cigarette smoking causes disease.  I'm
4      going to quit.  Her father-in-law quits in 1966.
5           Ms. Collar said that her father-in-law's
6      decision to quit in 1966 was his decision, but
7      she made no effort to quit when that warning
8      label appeared.
9           Ladies and gentlemen, this same warning
10      label went on all packs of cigarettes,
11      unfiltered, Camel cigarettes, filtered Marlboro
12      Red cigarettes, no distinction.  That's what the
13      evidence shows.
14           Ms. Collar knew smoking was dangerous.
15      She's 31 years old.  She's healthy.  She enjoys
16      smoking.  At this point, her attitude is it's
17      not going to happen to me.
18           That brings us to 1970.  Let's move forward
19      on the timeline.  Four years later.  1970, a new
20      warning label goes on all packs of cigarettes.
21      The warning now says, "The Surgeon General has
22      determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous
23      to your health."  Cigarette smoking is dangerous
24      to your health.
25           You heard Ms. Collar's testimony.  She said, yeah, I understood that as of 1970 the
2      Surgeon General has determined that smoking is
3      dangerous to your health.
4           I said, if you really heard
5      something different from the cigarette
6      companies, why didn't you ask somebody?  Why
7      didn't you ask your doctor?
8           Didn't do it.  Didn't think to do it.
9           In 1971 all cigarette ads are taken off of
10      television and radio here in the United States.
11           And then one year later, in 1972, every
12      cigarette ad in a newspaper or a magazine or a
13      billboard is required to carry this same Surgeon
14      General's warning.  That's as of 1972.
15           Now, Mr. Hammer tried to tell you, he used
16      the word "drown."  He told you all of the
17      warnings and all of the health messages that
18      we've been talking about, all of those over the
19      20 years prior to this point somehow were being
20      drowned out by statements made by cigarette
21      companies.  That's what Mr. Hammer told you.
22           But the evidence you've heard shows just
23      the opposite.
24           Remember what Dr. Proctor told you.
25      Dr. Proctor told you that between 1964, when that very first Surgeon General's report came
2      out, and 1979, somewhere in this period of time,
3      30 million Americans quit smoking.  30 million.
4      That's two million people every single year.
5      They've heard the same information as
6      Ms. Collar.  Many of them would be considered
7      addicted, according to the standards that
8      Dr. Niaura and Dr. Mannino told you.  But
9      millions make the decision to quit and they quit
10      for good, despite all of the statements that
11      Mr. Hammer talks about, despite all those
12      statements.  But not Ms. Collar.
13           You heard the facts.  She saw the warnings.
14      She understood what they meant.  She's healthy.
15      She enjoys smoking cigarettes.  At this point,
16      she's not truly motivated to quit smoking.
17           That brings us to 1976.  You heard that
18      Ms. Collar starts working for an elderly woman
19      named Margaret Gardener.  Ms. Collar was hired
20      as Ms. Gardener's personal nurse.  Shortly after
21      she starts working for Ms. Gardener,
22      Ms. Gardener is hospitalized for congestive
23      heart failure and a heart attack and she quits
24      smoking.
25           Why does Ms. Gardener quit smoking?  Her doctor told her to quit.  The same doctor that
2      Ms. Collar was talking to so she would know how
3      to take care of Ms. Gardener, so she would know
4      what medications to give her, so she would be
5      able to take care of her after she was out of
6      the hospital.
7           At this point, Ms. Collar actually said,
8      yeah, you know, I know from my experience as a
9      nurse, that doctors would tell people who had
10      heart attacks that they should quit.  People who
11      have congestive heart failure, they should quit.
12           Ms. Collar heard that.
13           Somehow she didn't think that that applied
14      to her, that it also wasn't harmful to your
15      lungs.
16           Once Ms. Gardener quit smoking, you heard
17      Fannie Collar said, I never smoked around
18      Ms. Gardener.  It would be unethical.  It's
19      common sense.  If you're a nurse or a doctor,
20      you don't smoke around your patient.
21           So she hardly ever smoked during that
22      seven- or eight-year period she worked for
23      Ms. Gardener.  Occasionally, she would go back
24      out on the patio and have a cigarette.  But she
25      controlled where, when, and how much she smoked when the circumstances, her job circumstances,
2      required it.
3           Dr. Ticknor told you that's not addiction.
4           That brings us to the early 1980s.  You
5      know that she gets separated from and divorces
6      Mr. Collar.
7           That brings us to 1985.  There's now a
8      series of four rotating warnings that go on all
9      packs of cigarettes as of 1985.  One of those
10      warnings says, "Surgeon General's warning:
11      Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease,
12      emphysema and may complicate pregnancy."
13           It says right on the label that smoking
14      causes two of the diseases, the two diseases
15      we've been talking about during this trial.
16           What did Ms. Collar tell you?  For eight
17      years, from 1985 to 1993, for eight years I
18      smoked cigarettes with these warnings on them
19      and I never looked at the warning once, not
20      once.
21           In the late -- you know that Merton Collar
22      first moves to Florida, and at some point
23      Ms. Collar says, I want to move to Florida too.
24      And she decides to move in with her ex-husband,
25      and they move into a home here in Vero Beach together.
2           In about 1990, Merton Collar quits smoking
3      for good.  You heard the testimony.  Merton
4      Collar quit smoking.  Dr. Niaura told you this.
5      He was coughing.  His lungs ached.  He
6      attributed those things to the fact that he was
7      smoking cigarettes.  That's what Dr. Niaura told
8      you.
9           Ms. Collar told you a different story.  She
10      said, oh, no.  Merton didn't quit because he was
11      concerned about his health.  He had allergies
12      for most of his life, and the smoking bothered
13      his allergies and that was really it.
14           I asked her point blank:  Are you telling
15      us that Mr. Collar never said to you, Fannie, I
16      need to quit because I'm concerned that
17      cigarette smoking is affecting my health?
18           She said, absolutely positively he never
19      said that.  She said she was the one that
20      actually encouraged him to quit.
21           But then when we confronted her with her
22      deposition, what did the deposition show?  She
23      admitted that Mr. Collar quit, and she continued
24      to smoke.
25           We asked her in the deposition, did you encourage him to quit?
2           And her answer, pretty profound:  I left
3      him alone.  I left him alone.
4           You know, for this period of time, for like
5      the next four, five years, between '89 and '93,
6      she works for a construction company, Netto
7      Construction.  The boss does not allow anybody
8      to smoke in the office.  She runs the entire
9      office.  She's got to answer the phone.  She's
10      got to be inside the whole day.  She said, maybe
11      occasionally I would step out and have a
12      cigarette.  But again, for four or five years
13      she controls where, when and how much she
14      smokes.
15           Now, Ms. Collar claims that she tried to
16      quit many times before 1993, but she also told
17      you that those efforts to quit smoking had
18      absolutely nothing to do with concerns about her
19      health.
20           So you have to ask yourself, was she really
21      trying to quit?  Well, she told you she went to
22      a smoking cessation clinic.  She did say that on
23      the witness stand.  But she said the people at
24      the smoking cessation clinic that she attended
25      didn't explain to her that cigarette smoking causes diseases like lung cancer and COPD.  She
2      said, in fact, I don't think they knew that
3      cigarette smoking was bad for your health.
4           Ladies and gentlemen, we brought someone
5      who ran smoking cessation clinics twenty-five
6      years ago, Dr. Ticknor.  Why do you think there
7      are smoking cessation clinics?  What did
8      Dr. Ticknor tell you?  Do they tell people at
9      the smoking cessation clinic that smoking causes
10      lung cancer and COPD?  Of course they do.  Why?
11      Dr. Ticknor explained it to you.  You want to
12      motivate people to change their behavior.  To
13      motivate them, you need to explain to them what
14      are the benefits of quitting smoking.  What are
15      the consequences if you continue with this
16      behavior.
17           I told you in my opening statement that
18      Ms. Collar never used Nicorette gum or nicotine
19      patch.  I told that you.  She admitted on the
20      stand, I never used a patch or the gum.
21           THE COURT:  It's been one hour.
22           MR. GERAGHTY:  She declined a patch when it
23      was actually offered to her in Arizona in 2009.
24      That's the only reference to the patch or the
25      gum in all of the medical records in this case. Ms. Collar's family, Dr. Niaura told you
2      this, neither Merton Collar or either her son
3      Mark or Earl recall a single day before 1993
4      where she ever stopped smoking for an entire
5      day.
6           Ms. Collar told you, other than that one
7      time where I quit smoking after hypnosis for
8      about three days, other than that one time, I
9      don't think I ever stopped smoking for more than
10      a few hours before 1993.
11           That brings us to July of 1993.  Let me go
12      to the last page of the timeline.
13           You know in July of 1993 Ms. Collar is
14      diagnosed with lung cancer.  She starts to cut
15      down, and she quits smoking the day that she
16      goes into the hospital.  That's what she told
17      you.
18           Now, Mr. Hammer suggested to you that she
19      was in the hospital for 45 straight days, but I
20      asked Dr. Mannino all about that.
21           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  I didn't
22      suggest anything.
23           THE COURT:  Sustained.
24           MR. HAMMER:  That's improper.
25           MR. GERAGHTY:  There was a suggestion at some point during the trial that she was in the
2      hospital for 45 days.
3           MR. HAMMER:  Objection.  You just sustained
4      that objection.
5           THE COURT:  Sustained.
6           MR. GERAGHTY:  You saw the medical records,
7      ladies and gentlemen.  You know that after being
8      in the hospital for about two weeks, Ms. Collar
9      was discharged and she was out of the hospital
10      for 13 days and didn't smoke for any of those
11      days.  Dr. Mannino told you that when I showed
12      him the medical records.
13           The good news is, as you heard, the surgery
14      was successful, and after the complications
15      associated with her ulcer, the doctors told you
16      that she was cured of her cancer.
17           For the next 13 or 14 years, from 1993 to
18      about 2006, Ms. Collar never smoked another
19      cigarette.  She testified that she didn't feel
20      like she wanted to smoke a cigarette.  She had
21      no cravings or urges for 13 or 14 years.
22           Her own doctor -- I showed you Dr. Suen --
23      he said she quit when she was motivated to do
24      so.
25           In 1997 she moves out of Merton's house. Eventually she meets Ben Sweeney.  You heard
2      about that.  You know that Mr. Sweeney is a
3      cigarette smoker too.  They start to spend a lot
4      of time together.  They go out to dinner.  They
5      go out to clubs.  They go dancing.  And
6      Ms. Collar would have a cigarette with Ben
7      Sweeney.  First it was just a puff or two.  Then
8      she would bum cigarettes.  She'd smoke one, two,
9      three cigarettes with him.
10           The plaintiff would have you believe that
11      Ms. Collar started smoking again because she was
12      addicted, but that's not what the evidence
13      shows.  You saw the medical records.  She told
14      you, I would go days.  Mr. Sweeney might give me
15      a cigarette or two, but I might go two or three
16      days without seeing Mr. Sweeney.  I wouldn't
17      smoke when I didn't see him.  That's what she
18      said.
19           She was a chipper just like Dr. Mannino
20      told you.  He told you chippers are not
21      addicted.  That's from their own expert.  These
22      records are all in evidence.  There's a
23      particular composite PMU, it's 43999, but these
24      are all of the records in that 2006 to 2009 time
25      period where she's talking about how much she's smoking, a half a pack a week, hasn't smoked for
2      over a month, hasn't smoked in 16 days, hasn't
3      smoked for a week, smoking a quarter of a pack,
4      two to five cigarettes a day.  That's what she
5      told her doctors in her medical records.
6           The truth is, and the evidence has shown,
7      ladies and gentlemen, that Ms. Collar started
8      smoking again because her boyfriend smoked and
9      she enjoyed smoking with him.  They went dancing
10      two or three times a week.  They had fun
11      together.
12           Now, did her smoking increase when she
13      heard about her daughter?  Certainly.
14      Certainly.  There's no dispute about that.  But
15      her decision to resume smoking in 2006 was an
16      informed decision by an adult with knowledge
17      that smoking was dangerous and addictive.
18           She did it anyway, though.  You know that
19      in June of 2009, after going to Arizona with Ben
20      Sweeny, had an exacerbation of her COPD and the
21      light bulb again goes off with Ms. Collar.  I
22      have to stop smoking.  I've been doing it for
23      the last three years, but I have to stop.  I had
24      an exacerbation of my COPD.
25           All these records, they're all in evidence. She told all of these doctors, I quit in June of
2      2009.
3           So that brings us to the present.
4           Ms. Collar is now 81 years old.  You heard
5      her own doctor say she's been cancer free for
6      more than 20 years, and she's been cured of her
7      cancer.  You know that she's been diagnosed with
8      COPD, but her own doctor, Dr. Suen, told you
9      that her lung function was pretty stable for
10      many years after her surgery until she decided
11      to resume smoking again in 2006.
12           You heard Dr. Suen also tell you that her
13      breathing is stable and that her condition is
14      well managed with medication.  Ms. Collar has
15      other health issues which you've heard about
16      which is not unusual for someone her age.
17           The truth is at some point we all slow
18      down.  We can't always do what we want.  But
19      fortunately, you know that Ms. Collar's health
20      issues haven't prevented her from living an
21      independent lifestyle.  You've heard that
22      Ms. Collar sleeps with oxygen at night, but she
23      doesn't use oxygen during the day to perform
24      most of her day-to-day activities.  She drives
25      to see her friends, to all of her appointments. Before Mr. Sweeney passed away, they traveled
2      frequently.  They went to Maine in her RV.  They
3      went to Arizona.  She didn't use supplemental
4      oxygen when they did that.  She's traveled
5      recently to Biloxi, Mississippi and Sarasota,
6      Florida, both times traveling without oxygen.
7           That's the story, ladies and gentlemen.
8      That's the story that brings us here together
9      and has brought us here together for the last
10      two weeks.
11           Now, with the time I have left, I would
12      like to talk to you about the questions on the
13      verdict form.
14           This is the first question you're going to
15      be asked on the verdict form.  Was Fannie Collar
16      addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?  If
17      so, was her addiction a legal cause of her lung
18      cancer and/or COPD?
19           So that's the first question.  This
20      question can really be broken down, ladies and
21      gentlemen, in two parts.  Was Fannie Collar
22      addicted to cigarettes, part one.  And part two,
23      if so, was her claimed addiction a legal cause
24      of her lung cancer and COPD?
25           If your answer to that question is no, that is a verdict for the defendants.  If you answer
2      yes, that is a verdict for the plaintiff.
3           So was Fannie Collar addicted to cigarettes
4      containing nicotine?  Let me remind you, the
5      Court has not given you a definition of
6      addiction or a set of medical criteria to
7      determine whether Ms. Collar was addicted.
8           So what's the evidence you've heard?
9      Plaintiffs first brought you Dr. Niaura.
10      Dr. Niaura decided that Ms. Collar was addicted
11      almost one year before he ever spoke to her.  He
12      is not a medical doctor.  In fact, he's not even
13      licensed as a psychologist.  He told you he's
14      never diagnosed anyone as addicted.  That's not
15      what he does.  The first person he ever said was
16      addicted was Fannie Collar herself.
17           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  Misstates
18      the evidence.
19           THE COURT:  Sustained.
20           MR. GERAGHTY:  He claims he used the DSM-V,
21      but he never showed it to you.  He never
22      explained to you why he thought she was addicted
23      under the DSM-V.
24           The plaintiff also brought you Dr. Mannino,
25      a pulmonologist, who doesn't see patients very often and very rarely sees patients who are
2      smokers.  That was Dr. Mannino.  He admitted
3      just a few years ago, I'm not an addiction
4      expert, but he changed his mind.  He changed his
5      mind for purposes of this case.
6           Dr. Mannino initially tried to dispute
7      this, but he eventually acknowledged that he
8      decided that Ms. Collar was addicted before he
9      had read a single page of her medical records or
10      any of the depositions.  He told you he had a
11      10-minute conversation with Mr. Gdanski, and
12      Mr. Gdanski told him Fannie Collar smoked
13      cigarettes and had lung cancer and COPD.
14      Dr. Mannino said, you know what, that's good
15      enough for me.  She must be addicted.
16           Ladies and gentlemen, ask yourself, is that
17      the way we diagnose people with illnesses in
18      this country?  Of course not.  Of course not.
19           But what did Dr. Mannino admit when I
20      crossed him?  He said, people who don't smoke
21      every day are not addicted.  We call them
22      chippers because they can control where, when
23      and how much they smoke.  And you know that
24      there were many years when Ms. Collar didn't
25      smoke every day.  She said that was the case when she was smoking with Ben Sweeney.
2           Addiction is one of the key issues in this
3      case, ladies and gentlemen, but plaintiff's
4      expert concluded that Fannie was addicted before
5      they had all the facts.
6           So that brings us to Ms. Collar.  She
7      repeatedly told you that she thought she was
8      addicted and she tried to quit many times, but
9      she couldn't recall more than one occasion
10      before 1993 where she tried to quit for more
11      than a few hours.
12           So when you evaluate Ms. Collar's testimony
13      that she was addicted, bear in mind that the
14      same person who is telling you that she's
15      addicted is the same person who just asked you
16      for $15 million.
17           MR. HAMMER:  Objection.  Improper argument.
18           THE COURT:  Overruled.
19           MR. GERAGHTY:  She refuses to admit many
20      things that your common sense tells you must be
21      true.  Much of what she said is contradicted by
22      what she told her own doctors in her own medical
23      records many years ago.
24           We brought you Dr. Ticknor.  You know based
25      upon what you heard Dr. Ticknor say, and the evidence in this case, Ms. Collar is not
2      addicted.
3           Dr. Ticknor is a board-certified clinical
4      psychiatrist, a medical doctor.  Over the course
5      of his career, he's diagnosed thousands of
6      people with addictions to all sorts of
7      substances.  He has run smoking cessation
8      clinics.  Every week he sees about 20 to 30
9      people who are there because they'd like
10      counseling to quit smoking.  He's diagnosed many
11      smokers as addicted.  Unlike the plaintiff's
12      experts, Dr. Ticknor actually took the time to
13      get to know Fannie Collar.  He read all of her
14      medical records, all of the depositions.  He had
15      a two-hour-and-40-minute psychiatric examination
16      with her and then he filled out a very detailed
17      report and provided it to everybody.  He gave
18      you a real set of medical criteria to determine
19      whether Fannie Collar was addicted.  The DSM-V,
20      we put it on the screen.  He explained it to
21      you.  He walked you through his analysis in
22      detail.  Dr. Ticknor told you Ms. Collar was not
23      addicted to cigarettes.
24           So at the end of the day, ladies and
25      gentlemen, you have to ask yourself, is the plaintiff's evidence sufficient in a court of
2      law or should something more be required?  Like
3      tangible, credible, believable evidence from
4      someone who does not have an interest in the
5      outcome of the case.
6           I think, ladies and gentlemen, based upon
7      the two weeks we've spent here, the answer
8      should be obvious.  The answer should be no,
9      Fannie Collar was not addicted.
10           But even if you believe that she was
11      addicted, your work is just beginning because
12      that still leaves the second part of this
13      question.
14           Was her claimed addiction a legal cause of
15      her lung cancer and COPD?
16           You saw the instruction on legal cause.
17      And I'll admit, frankly, it's a difficult
18      instruction to follow, even if you're a lawyer.
19           So let me give you an example that I think
20      will simplify the whole process.
21           We all live here in Florida.  We have
22      beautiful beaches.  We have lots of sunshine.
23      We all know that exposure to sun --
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
[#DELETED RECESS#]
21 22           MR. GERAGHTY:  All right.  Let me try
23      again.
24           So you have a blemish or a mark on your
25      skin, you go see the doctor -- HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
2           THE COURT:  Sustained.
3           MR. GERAGHTY:  You have a mark on your
4      skin.  You may be concerned about it, and you
5      say to yourself, what do I do about it?  Do I do
6      anything about it?  Do I let it go or have it
7      looked at or continue?  Some people will go see
8      the doctor.
9           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
10           THE COURT:  Overruled.
11           MR. GERAGHTY:  Some people go to the
12      doctor.  They have it checked.  Other people
13      don't deal with those things.  They let it go.
14      So that's simply the point I'm trying to make.
15           So in the example I'm talking about,
16      exposure to the sun is the medical reason why
17      you get the blemish that may develop into skin
18      cancer, but the legal cause in the explanation
19      I'm giving you is the fact that you didn't pay
20      attention to the problem.  You didn't have it
21      looked at by a doctor.  You let too much time go
22      by.
23           So a problem that could have been addressed
24      and perhaps nipped in the bud early on becomes a
25      bigger and bigger problem to the point where you're dealing with a serious case of skin
2      cancer.  That's what I mean in distinguishing
3      medical cause from legal cause.
4           In a case like this, ladies and gentlemen,
5      the question of legal cause really boils down to
6      the question of quitting smoking.  Quitting
7      smoking.  Ask yourself, based on all of the
8      evidence you've heard in this case, was Fannie
9      Collar's claimed addiction so strong, so
10      substantial that it stood in the way of a
11      committed and determined effort on her part to
12      quit smoking?
13           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
14           THE COURT:  Sustained.
15           MR. GERAGHTY:  The evidence in this case is
16      undisputed that Fannie Collar could only recall
17      one occasion, just one occasion where she quit
18      smoking for more than a few hours before 1993.
19      It wasn't until she was diagnosed with lung
20      cancer and told by her doctor, you need to quit,
21      and then of course she did.  She quit when she
22      was motivated by what her doctor told her.  You
23      know, the evidence is undisputed, she quit
24      smoking for the next 13 or 14 years.  She had no
25      cravings to smoke and no urges to smoke. She resumed smoking in 2006, smokes for
2      about three years, and then what happens?  She's
3      told by a doctor in Arizona, she's had an
4      exacerbation of her COPD.  She quits again in
5      2009.  Why?  Why, because she had the
6      exacerbation of COPD.  She knew she had to quit.
7           Dr. Ticknor told you what ultimately
8      determines whether someone will quit smoking is
9      motivation.  Where does motivation come from?
10      It doesn't come from Chantix or Wellbutrin.  It
11      comes within each and every one of us.  That's
12      where motivation comes from.
13           That's not just what Dr. Ticknor told all
14      of us here in the courtroom.  He told you that's
15      what he tells his patients, motivation.  Who
16      else told you the same thing?  Dr. Suen told you
17      Ms. Collar quit when she was sufficiently
18      motivated to do so.  Would you agree?  I believe
19      so.  That's from the doctor that knows her
20      better than anybody, from right here in Vero
21      Beach.
22           If you decide that Fannie Collar could have
23      quit smoking whenever she was truly motivated to
24      do so, then addiction is not a legal cause of
25      her disease. HAMMER:  Objection.  That's not the
2      legal standard.
3           THE COURT:  Sustained.
4           MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I'm simply
5      responding to his arguments.
6           Rather, ladies and gentlemen, the legal
7      cause in this case is Ms. Collar's decision to
8      continue to smoke cigarettes --
9           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  That's not
10      what I said.
11           THE COURT:  Overruled.
12           MR. GERAGHTY:  Rather, the legal cause in
13      this case, ladies and gentlemen, is Ms. Collar's
14      decision to smoke cigarettes in the face of all
15      the warnings that we talked about, year to year,
16      decade to decade, 35 to 40 years, and her
17      decision not to make a committed and determined
18      and motivated effort to quit until 1993.  That,
19      ladies and gentlemen, is the one and the only
20      legal cause in this case.
21           Frankly, you don't have to look any further
22      than plaintiff's own experts.  Despite
23      everything Mr. Hammer told you about nicotine
24      and receptors and brain changes, what did
25      Dr. Niaura and Dr. Mannino ultimately acknowledge?  They told you anyone can quit
2      smoking if they are motivated to do so.
3           60 million Americans have quit smoking in
4      this country.  The overwhelming majority have
5      quit cold turkey, without any assistance
6      whatsoever.  Most of those people would have
7      been considered, according to Dr. Mannino and
8      Dr. Niaura, as addicted.
9           Nevertheless, they told you that they quit
10      and they quit cold turkey.  The nicotine in
11      cigarettes didn't prevent those 60 million
12      people from understanding that smoking causes
13      lung cancer and COPD and from exercising their
14      free will to stop smoking.
15           During the last two weeks you've heard no
16      evidence that Ms. Collar was any different.
17      There's no dispute.  She is intelligent.  She is
18      well educated.  She is independent and
19      strong-willed.  The truth is that for most of
20      her life Ms. Collar wanted to smoke cigarettes
21      and had no real interest in quitting until after
22      she was diagnosed with cancer.
23           She told her husband, mind your own
24      business.  It's my decision whether or not I
25      smoke.  That's not addiction talking.  That's a strong-willed, independent person saying, hey,
2      this is my decision.
3           Ms. Collar claims she was addicted, but
4      addiction did not force her to smoke.  She
5      smoked because that's what she wanted to do, and
6      that's what the second part of this question --
7      was her addiction a legal cause of her lung
8      cancer and/or COPD?  That's what that second
9      part of that question is all about.
10           You've heard the evidence.  You know that
11      Fannie Collar was always in control, not Philip
12      Morris, not R.J. Reynolds, not Liggett, not the
13      nicotine in cigarettes.  Your answer to this
14      question should be no, and your verdict should
15      be for the defendants in this case.
16           Now, I don't think you'll get as far as
17      Question Number 2 on the verdict form, but since
18      Mr. Hammer talked about it, let me simply
19      respond.  You'll be asked to state the
20      percentage of any responsibility for
21      Ms. Collar's lung cancer and/or COPD.  That's
22      Question Number 2.
23           So what does it mean to accept
24      responsibility for the decisions we make in
25      life?  Well, imagine we -- there's been a lot of testimony about alcohol.  People drink alcohol.
2      Many of us have had the experience.  Imagine a
3      person who drinks and one night they drink a
4      little too much alcohol.  They have a few too
5      many drinks, and the next day they wake up with
6      a hangover.  We've all had the experience.  You
7      wake up, eyes are blurry, bloodshot.
8           MR. HAMMER:  Objection.
9           THE COURT:  Overruled.
10           MR. GERAGHTY:  The person goes to the
11      mirror.  They look at themselves in the mirror
12      and say, you know what, I'm only 5 or 10 percent
13      responsible for that decision I made to have all
14      those drinks last night.  Nobody says that.
15      Nobody says that, ladies and gentlemen.
16           Was anyone else responsible for the
17      decisions that Fannie Collar made, the decisions
18      she made to smoke cigarettes for 35 years?  The
19      answer is of course not.
20           In 1955 her attitude was, I'm not going to
21      slow down until I'm in my 80s.  That's what she
22      said when she was 21 years old.  Today she told
23      you she goes to the convenience store and buys
24      her son Mark cigarettes and cigars, today.  She
25      told you on Friday, who knows, I may go back to smoking again.  She said that after everything
2      that we've heard over the last two weeks.
3           The facts of this case show loud and clear
4      that Fannie Collar got up every single day, made
5      her own decisions in life, and no one else made
6      those decisions for her.  Accepting
7      responsibility means simply that, accepting full
8      responsibility for the consequences of the
9      decisions we make in life.
10           And that's what you should put down if you
11      get this far on the verdict form.  There should
12      be no doubt that Fannie Collar is 100 percent
13      responsible for the decisions she's made during
14      the course of her life.
15           Now, again, I don't think you're going to
16      get this far on the verdict form, but Mr. Hammer
17      discussed Question Numbers 3 and 4.  They're
18      kind of companion questions, if you will.
19           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  Misstates
20      the law.
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.
22           MR. GERAGHTY:  Question 3 says, Please,
23      state as to each defendant whether Ms. Collar
24      reasonably relied to her detriment on a
25      statement or misinformation made by that defendant which concealed or omitted material
2      information concerning the health effects and/or
3      addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and if
4      so, whether such reliance on a statement or
5      misinformation was a legal cause of her lung
6      cancer and/or COPD.
7           That's a mouthful, right.  Then there's a
8      companion Question 4 on the next page that is
9      worded almost --
10           MR. HAMMER:  Objection.
11           THE COURT:  Sustained.
12           MR. HAMMER:  Can we approach if need be?
13           THE COURT:  Yes, approach.
14           MR. HAMMER:  They're individual questions.
15           THE COURT:  Approach.
16           MR. GERAGHTY:  Do you want to approach?
17 18           THE COURT:  What is your objection?
19           MR. HAMMER:  These aren't companion
20      questions.  Each question is an independent
21      question.
22           MR. GERAGHTY:  They're worded almost
23      exactly the same, Judge.
24           MR. HAMMER:  It doesn't matter.  They're
25      not companion questions.  They are each independent questions.
2           MR. GERAGHTY:  It's argument, Your Honor.
3           THE COURT:  You can argue that on your
4      rebuttal.
5           MR. GERAGHTY:  He talked about fishes and
6      hooks and he's complaining --
7           THE COURT:  It is not the law.  I am the
8      one that instructs them.
9 10           MR. GERAGHTY:  The point I'm trying to
11      make, ladies and gentlemen, if you go over to
12      page 2, Question Number 4 looks very similar to
13      Question Number 3 except there's a reference to,
14      In furtherance of defendant's agreement to
15      conceal or omit material information.
16           So the language of the two questions,
17      you'll see, are very, very similar.  The concept
18      that they are trying to convey is very similar.
19           Let me make two quick points.  If you
20      answer yes to either Question 3 or Question 4,
21      the whole concept of responsibility goes out the
22      window, and the plaintiff is asking you to award
23      her 100 percent of any damages if you decide to
24      award damages.
25           MR. HAMMER:  Objection.  Misstates the law. THE COURT:  Overruled.
2           MR. GERAGHTY:  Now, what Questions 3 and 4
3      are really asking you, ladies and gentlemen, is,
4      did Fannie Collar make any decisions about
5      cigarette smoking because of a statement made by
6      a cigarette company that omitted information?
7           Ms. Collar claims that in 1966 she heard a
8      statement that if you were concerned about your
9      health, you should smoke a filtered cigarette
10      because it was safe.
11           First, you know she was smoking filtered
12      cigarettes for 10 or 11 years before she claims
13      she ever heard that statement.  She told you,
14      this is the same testimony I showed you earlier,
15      that statement didn't make an impression on me.
16      That statement didn't make any impression on me.
17      That's what she told you.
18           The same year she claims she heard that
19      statement, 1966, was the same year that warning
20      labels go on all packs of cigarettes, filtered
21      and unfiltered.  That's the undisputed evidence
22      in the case, ladies and gentlemen.  The truth
23      is, there was no evidence that anything the
24      defendants said or did not say caused Fannie
25      Collar to start smoking or to continue smoking. After all, look at Ms. Collar in 2006.
2      When at the age of 72, after not smoking for 13
3      years, she begins dating Ben Sweeney, and she
4      starts smoking cigarettes again.  She knew that
5      she had lung cancer and COPD in 2006.  She chose
6      to smoke anyway.  Now she wants you to believe
7      that she wouldn't have made that same decision
8      back in the 1950s.
9           Well, the decision she made in 2006
10      demonstrates that's not true.  She didn't listen
11      to her co-worker back in 1955.  She didn't
12      listen to her ex-husband, Merton.  She didn't
13      listen to her foster sister, Christine Coffin.
14      She didn't listen to her father-in-law.  And she
15      certainly didn't listen to her own doctors.
16           Ms. Collar didn't listen to what anyone
17      told her.  So what makes anyone think she would
18      have listened to tobacco companies?  The answer
19      to both Questions 3 and 4 should be no.  The
20      answers should be no.
21           Now, I want to talk briefly about
22      compensatory damages.  Again, I don't think you
23      will get this far on the verdict form, but I
24      need to respond to what Mr. Hammer told you.
25           He asked you to award $15 million for the decisions that Ms. Collar and only Ms. Collar
2      made to smoke.  That is an incredible sum of
3      money.  For some families, $50,000 is a lot of
4      money.
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
6 7           MR. GERAGHTY:  $50,000 a year is a lot of
8      money, a lot of money, ladies and gentlemen.  It
9      would take 20 years earning $50,000 a year just
10      to make $1 million, just to make $1 million.  It
11      would take 300 years, 300 years earning $50,000
12      a year to get to the 15 million number that
13      Mr. Hammer asked you for.
14           No one doubts, no one doubts that
15      Ms. Collar's lung cancer and surgery were
16      difficult.  All you had to do was watch
17      Ms. Collar when she testified to know that she
18      has a lot more life and energy than many people
19      who are 81 years old.  You know she's been able
20      to do a lot of things that other people her age
21      are not able to do.  She was dancing with Ben
22      Sweeney two or three nights a week just a few
23      years ago.
24           If you actually get to the issue of
25      damages, there should be no question, ladies and gentlemen, that tens of thousands of dollars,
2      let alone millions of dollars should be out of
3      the question and off the table.
4           These facts are undisputed.  Ms. Collar
5      smoked for 35 years.  She got lung cancer.  But
6      fortunately, she was cured of her lung cancer.
7      You heard her own expert, Dr. Mannino, tell you
8      that she was very fortunate that she survived
9      stage 3 lung cancer.
10           But despite all of that, after not smoking
11      for 13 or 14 years, Ms. Collar dates Ben
12      Sweeney, and at the age of 72 she decides to
13      resume smoking because they were having fun and
14      enjoying life together in their golden years.
15      After having an exacerbation of her COPD she
16      then quit smoking again in 2009.
17           Dr. Suen, her treating pulmonologist, told
18      you that her condition today is stable and well
19      managed with medication.  But despite all of
20      that, on Friday Ms. Collar told you, I can't say
21      I won't be back to cigarettes again.
22           Yesterday her own lawyers read to you the
23      mortality table that Ms. Collar is expected to
24      live nine more years to the age of 90.  The
25      truth is that despite having lung cancer and COPD, she's going to live a lot longer than most
2      of us in this courtroom.
3           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  Improper
4      argument.
5           THE COURT:  Overruled.
6           MR. GERAGHTY:  Given the evidence you've
7      heard in this case about Fannie Collar, Fannie
8      Collar's case, there is no basis to award
9      damages.
10           Now, the final question on the verdict form
11      asks whether you find by clear and convincing
12      evidence that punitive damages are warranted
13      against the defendants in this case.  I want --
14      if you answered no to that question, you will
15      never get to the issue of punitive damages.  Let
16      me talk briefly to you so you understand what
17      issue you're being asked to decide.
18           You're not being asked to decide the amount
19      of punitive damages.  The issue here today is
20      whether based upon clear and convincing evidence
21      the plaintiff has shown that she is entitled to
22      punitive damages.  So don't spend one moment
23      thinking about the amount.  The question before
24      you is whether Fannie Collar has shown under the
25      evidence and the law that she's entitled to punitive damages.
2           THE COURT:  You have two minutes.
3           MR. GERAGHTY:  I'll probably take one or
4      two more, but thank you.
5           If you decide that she is, there will be
6      another phase of the trial.  The parties will
7      present evidence.  We will have additional
8      arguments and then you will get to the amount
9      stage.
10           Now, I want to make sure that if you get to
11      this issue, you clearly understand what it is
12      you will be asked to decide.  When you look at
13      the instructions, you will see that clear and
14      convincing evidence is defined.  It's a much
15      higher burden of proof than the greater weight
16      of the evidence.
17           With respect to punitive damages, you will
18      see that the evidence must be precise, explicit,
19      lacking in confusion, and of such weight that it
20      produces a firm belief or conviction without
21      hesitation about the issue.  In other words, you
22      need to be really, really, really convinced that
23      punitive damages are appropriate.
24           Based on the evidence in this case, nothing
25      the defendants did or did not do, said or did not say harmed Fannie Collar.  Philip Morris,
2      Liggett, and R.J. Reynolds sold cigarettes.  The
3      Judge told you making, selling, and advertising
4      cigarettes is not a basis for liability.  The
5      Court instructed you that that is the case.
6           Fannie Collar always had the information
7      available to her to make a decision about
8      whether she wanted to smoke cigarettes or not,
9      whether she wanted to quit or not.  She always
10      had the ability to quit whenever she was
11      motivated to do so, and the evidence you've
12      heard in this case demonstrates that that's so.
13           She simply did not want to quit smoking
14      until it was too late to avoid her lung cancer
15      and her COPD.  You've heard no evidence during
16      this trial that the defendants said or did not
17      say anything that caused her to begin smoking or
18      to continue smoking.
19           Dr. Proctor spent several days talking to
20      you about the culture of smoking and the tobacco
21      companies, but he admitted to you he knows
22      nothing about Fannie Collar.  He knows nothing
23      about what she knew and what she did.
24           Given the evidence you've heard, ladies and
25      gentlemen, the plaintiff simply has not met her burden of proof.  There is no basis for the
2      award of punitive damages in this case.  So your
3      answer to that question, if you were to get that
4      far, should be no.
5           Now, I'm going to sit down in about a
6      minute.  I'm in the home stretch at this point.
7      You're going to hear from Ms. St.
8      Peter-Griffith.  You're going to hear from
9      Mr. Belasic.  After that Mr. Hammer will have
10      one more opportunity to speak to you.  That's
11      because, as you heard, the plaintiff bears the
12      burden of proof.  So he gets the opportunity to
13      speak to you one more time in what is called
14      rebuttal.
15           I don't know what Mr. Hammer will say, but
16      I can imagine he's going to say some things that
17      are very critical of Philip Morris and R.J.
18      Reynolds and Liggett.  I'm pretty sure of that.
19      But as you listen to the things he says, ask
20      yourself, what does this have to do with Fannie
21      Collar?
22           What does this have to do with Ms. Collar
23      and the decisions that she made, a strong,
24      intelligent, and well-educated woman who, you
25      know, lived her life exactly the way she wanted to live it, who enjoyed smoking cigarettes, and
2      who was not motivated to quit until 1993?
3           The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, we do
4      enjoy a tremendous amount of freedom in this
5      country.  We have the right to make decisions
6      and lifestyle choices that are not always in our
7      best interests, that can have serious health
8      consequences.  With that freedom comes the
9      obligation to accept personal responsibility for
10      the consequences.
11           In the end, ladies and gentlemen, that's
12      what this case is all about.  Are we going to
13      hold Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds and Liggett
14      legally responsible, legally responsible for the
15      decisions made by a strong, intelligent, and
16      independent person?  That's what this case is
17      all about.
18           Based on the evidence you've heard for the
19      last two weeks, the answer should be clear.
20      Based on the evidence you've heard in Fannie
21      Collar's case, in this case, the evidence
22      supports one and only one true verdict.  That,
23      ladies and gentlemen, is a verdict for Philip
24      Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and Liggett.
25           So this is my last opportunity to get to speak to you, and all I really want to do is
2      leave you with a deep, heartfelt thanks because
3      I know I spent a lot of time questioning
4      witnesses and you probably said, oh my goodness,
5      when is he going to sit down?  I'm going to sit
6      down for the last time.  I really sincerely
7      appreciate your time, patience, and attention to
8      everything we've done during the course of the
9      last two weeks.  Thank you very much.


13           MS. ST. PETER-GRIFFITH:  May it please the
14      Court, Counsel, Ms. Collar.
15           Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm Ann
16      St-Peter Griffith.  It's my privilege to be
17      representing Liggett Group LLC in this matter.
18      I want to say it's been a pleasure to be before
19      you in this courtroom.  And on behalf of myself,
20      Ms. Kaschel and Liggett, we thank you.  We
21      understand that you made a tremendous commitment
22      in your jury service.
23           Mr. Geraghty and Mr. Belasic's closing
24      arguments provide you with a roadmap to checking
25      no as to each question on the jury verdict form. We agree.  Please remember that it is
2      plaintiff's burden of proof here as to each
3      defendant.
4           The evidence regarding Liggett in this case
5      has been pretty clear.  Ms. Collar never smoked
6      a Liggett cigarette.  She was never addicted to
7      any Liggett cigarettes.  Liggett's products
8      played no role in causing her lung cancer or her
9      COPD.  Moreover, Mrs. Collar could not identify
10      a single statement that she either heard or read
11      or relied upon from Liggett.
12           Now, you'll remember she made reference to
13      a statement that she heard from the Tobacco
14      Institute.  Ms. Collar didn't show you that
15      statement.  She never told you who said it or
16      where they said it or how they said it.  She
17      knew she heard it around 1966.
18           Ladies and gentlemen, even if you believe
19      that she heard or relied upon that statement,
20      you need to know something else.  There was no
21      evidence of Liggett's membership in the Tobacco
22      Institute when the statement was made, even if
23      it was.
24           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  Objection.
25      Misstates the evidence. THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           MS. ST. PETER-GRIFFITH:  Dr. Proctor told
3      you that Liggett was on and off as a member of
4      the Tobacco Institute.  Plaintiff didn't
5      establish when Liggett was a member.  Ms. Collar
6      has not --
7           MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach?
8           THE COURT:  Yes.
9 10           MR. HAMMER:  Liggett cannot distance
11      themselves from the conspiracy.  They are part
12      of the conspiracy by virtue of the Engle
13      findings.
14           THE COURT:  She can argue whatever she
15      wants.  If she says that you didn't find that
16      they were off and on --
17           MR. HAMMER:  You can't distance yourself
18      from the Engle findings, that's what they are
19      doing.  In a very nuanced way they are arguing
20      that they're not part of the Engle findings.
21      You can't negate the Engel findings.
22           THE COURT:  You can argue that on your
23      rebuttal.
24           MR. HAMMER:  They can't do it, Judge.
25           THE COURT:  You can argue that on your rebuttal.  On the jury verdict there is a
2      question about whether or not they were part of
3      the conspiracy.  So overruled.
4 5           MS. ST. PETER-GRIFFITH:  Ms. Collar has not
6      carried her burden of proof to show either that
7      she relied upon a material statement concealing
8      information or that Liggett's participation in
9      any agreement to conceal caused her injuries.
10           Now, there's only one document that
11      Plaintiff showed you regarding Liggett, the L&M
12      document.  Plaintiff's expert acknowledged that
13      Liggett did not join the TIRC and didn't attend
14      the Plaza Hotel meeting.  It didn't sign the
15      Frank Statement.  Beginning around the end of
16      the 1960s, Liggett's market share plummeted --
17           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
18           THE COURT:  Sustained.
19           MR. HAMMER:  There's no evidence of that.
20           MS. ST. PETER-GRIFFITH:  I'd like to take a
21      few moments to discuss with you what Liggett put
22      into evidence.  This information is what the --
23      was not elicited from Dr. Proctor on direct.
24      It's right here.  I'm not going to put it up on
25      the screen in the interest of time, but you're going to be able to take it with you into the
2      jury room.
3           The evidence shows a number of things.
4      Liggett's 1963 submission to the Surgeon
5      General.  It's pretty big.  It's heavy.  It
6      discusses a link between carcinogens in
7      cigarette smoke and lung cancer, as well as
8      other diseases.  Liggett's extensive submission
9      also included a chapter on habituation and
10      addiction.
11           Everything that is substantively in the L&M
12      document is right here, except in much, much
13      more detail.  Liggett turned this submission
14      over to the number 1 public health authority in
15      the country, the Surgeon General.
16           Some of Liggett's research was also
17      published in other publications as well.  As
18      these documents show, by 1966 Liggett had a
19      ten-year relationship working in productive
20      collaboration with the Public Health Authority,
21      productive collaboration.  As early as 1954
22      Liggett was working with the American Cancer
23      Society.  Its investment in research was
24      extensive, more than any other companies.
25           Now, to be sure, other companies were also doing research.  In fact, Dr. Proctor discussed
2      Philip Morris's compendium that it compiled of
3      research of all defendants as well as other
4      companies.
5           Now, you heard about Liggett's on and off
6      again tobacco -- membership in the Tobacco
7      Institute, Liggett's CTR membership was under
8      four years, and Liggett contributed only a
9      minuscule amount of funding to each
10      organization, under 1 percent.  There's no
11      evidence of Liggett engaging in youth marketing.
12      And by 1978 Liggett was selling generic products
13      and not advertising.
14           Dr. Proctor told you that his advertising
15      opinions didn't apply to Liggett.  Liggett
16      voluntarily turned over its documents, and
17      starting in the '90s it disclosed its
18      ingredients on its cartons.  Beginning also in
19      the 1990s Liggett placed addiction warnings on
20      all of its products and packaging voluntarily.
21           Dr. Proctor told you that Liggett should be
22      commended, commended.  This is hardly conduct
23      demonstrating participation in an agreement to
24      conceal, and it certainly does not reflect by
25      clear and convincing evidence that Liggett should be subjected to punitive damages.
2           Ladies and gentlemen, there's an old
3      lawyer's expression that Mr. Geraghty told you
4      about.  Jurors do not check their common sense
5      at the courthouse door.  Common sense tells us
6      that many aspects of plaintiff's case do not add
7      up.
8           For all of her years of smoking, Ms. Collar
9      said that she didn't look at the warnings on
10      cigarette packs, after that initial time that
11      they were pointed out to her by her
12      father-in-law.  Even after being cured of
13      smoking-related lung cancer, she said that she
14      would believe that cigarettes are harmful when
15      they stopped making them.
16           As the Judge has already instructed you,
17      manufacturing, selling, and advertising
18      cigarettes are lawful activities.  Think about
19      that.  Trust your common sense.
20           Ladies and gentlemen, it's understandable
21      to empathize with someone who is dealing with
22      illness.  However, despite what might be natural
23      feelings of sympathy, when we began this
24      process, you took an oath as jurors to follow
25      the evidence and to base your decision only upon the evidence.
2           The Judge will instruct you that in
3      reaching your verdict you should not let bias,
4      sympathy, prejudice, public opinion, or any
5      other sentiment for or against any party
6      influence your decision.
7           Liggett and the other defendants are not
8      responsible to Ms. Collar because she relied
9      upon any statement attributable to an agreement
10      to conceal.  Ms. Collar made her own decisions,
11      and accordingly we ask that you render a verdict
12      in favor of my client, Liggett, Philip Morris,
13      Reynolds.
14           On behalf of Ms. Kaschel, Liggett, my
15      client, the defendants, defense counsel, I just
16      want to end by saying again, thank you very much
17      for the careful attention that we know you're
18      going to pay to the evidence and for the
19      sacrifices that you've made in your service on
20      this jury.  Thank you.


9           MR. BELASIC:  Thank you, Your Honor.
10           Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for all
11      you've done both for the parties in this case
12      and, frankly, for our system of civil
13      government.  I've got about 20 minutes to go
14      over a few of the issues.  I'll be the last
15      defense lawyer to speak, and then Mr. Hammer
16      will speak.
17           I predict Mr. Hammer will show you a lot of
18      documents and tell you how bad they are for the
19      defendants.  What I'm going to talk about, no
20      amount of documents, good, bad, or otherwise,
21      can change.
22           This morning you were hearing about what
23      Mr. Hammer said was a fish story, Ms. Collar was
24      the fish and addiction is the hook.  Around that
25      time he said a couple of phrases that I wrote down.  One of the things that he said is that
2      when she was trying to quit over these years,
3      she was, quote, too addicted to quit.
4           Well, we all know the evidence shows that's
5      not true.  She quit for 14 straight years.  She
6      took the stand and said that from '93 until 2006
7      or 2007 she quit, zero cigarettes.  Dr. Niaura
8      said that she quit for those 14 years, zero
9      cigarettes.
10           She also had zero craving.  The evidence,
11      again, was directly from Ms. Collar.  When she
12      was on the stand during cross-examination,
13      Mr. Geraghty said, isn't it true that during
14      those 14 years you had no craving?  She said it
15      wasn't.  You saw the evidence, that Mr. Geraghty
16      had her read her sworn testimony, the sworn
17      testimony that she gave before trial.  She had
18      no craving.
19           So we know, too addicted to quit, that's
20      not right.  It was just the opposite.  It was
21      the other way around.  She was too capable or so
22      capable, so capable of quitting that nicotine --
23      whether you call it a nicotine habit or a
24      nicotine addiction, she was so capable of
25      quitting that nicotine can't be a substantial contributing factor.  We know she could quit.
2      When she was properly motivated, she did so.
3           We know she went back to smoking.  After 14
4      years without a cigarette, at the age of 72, 72,
5      at a time went the companies were saying on
6      their website that smoking caused lung cancer
7      and COPD, she started smoking when she dated Ben
8      Sweeney.
9           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  Can we
10      approach?
11 12           MR. HAMMER:  I don't think Reynolds
13      presented any evidence as to when they actually
14      put that on their website.
15           MR. BELASIC:  Dr. Proctor -- this guy is
16      doing this over and over again.  He's got to
17      stop doing this.  I'm going to call him out in
18      front of the jury.  Dr. Proctor said it.
19           THE COURT:  He did.
20           MR. HAMMER:  I want that reflected on the
21      record, he's going to call me out in front of
22      the jury.
23           THE COURT:  Yes.
24           MR. HAMMER:  And you know what, they will
25      do that because they know I will never move for a mistrial.  Those are the things they do,
2      Judge.  I just want to point that out to the
3      Court.
4           MR. BELASIC:  This is the third time in a
5      row he has falsely claimed that something wasn't
6      in evidence.
7           THE COURT:  All right.  Dr. Proctor
8      testified as to all of this, and there's lots of
9      it in evidence.  Overruled.
10 11           MR. BELASIC:  Ladies and gentlemen, as I
12      was saying, it came from Dr. Proctor, the
13      witness that the plaintiffs called as their very
14      first expert witness, Dr. Proctor was asked by
15      Mr. Gdanski, when did the tobacco companies
16      start telling people it caused lung cancer,
17      COPD, was addictive?  Starting in the late '90s.
18           So five, six, seven years later, when she's
19      dating Ben Sweeney as a 72-year-old woman, at a
20      time when the companies are warning everyone
21      their products cause disease, their products are
22      addictive, she went back to smoking.
23           A few years later she decided to quit, and
24      we know that she has quit for the last five or
25      six years.  So too addicted to quit, that's not -- just not true, it's exactly the opposite
2      of the real evidence in this case.
3           One of the other things I heard this
4      morning is, you were repeatedly asked the
5      question, what chance did Fannie have?  What
6      chance did Ms. Collar have?  Well, the evidence
7      from her and the evidence from her experts is
8      that when it comes to quitting, she had a
9      100 percent chance.  When she was sufficiently
10      motivated, she had the ability to quit.
11           And there is no dispute, Dr. Niaura they
12      brought, Dr. Mannino, Dr. Ticknor, our evidence,
13      there's no dispute, when she was sufficiently
14      motivated, she was capable of quitting because
15      everyone in this courtroom knows that she did
16      quit.
17           There was a lot of discussion about
18      Dr. Suen, and I want to say a couple of things.
19      You know, you heard a lot about 8,000 pages of
20      medical records or thousands of pages of medical
21      records.  You saw a lot of references to
22      different doctors.
23           In this case only one doctor for the
24      plaintiff testified, only one doctor actually
25      treated her, and that's Dr. Suen.  He has seen her for 22 years.  Let's see what Dr. Suen said.
2           Does Dr. Suen say nicotine overpowered her?
3      Does Dr. Suen say nicotine was the substantial
4      contributing factor because it made her smoke
5      and she couldn't quit?  He told you, she quit
6      when she was motivated.  Here is what he said.
7 (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as
8 follows:)
9      Q    What was your impression of Ms. Collar's
10 awareness that smoking was not good for her health
11 during the 21 years that you were treating her?
12      A    I think she knew smoking was a problem for
13 her, so I think she understood that.
14      Q    Would you agree Ms. Collar quit when she
15 was sufficiently motivated to do so?
16      A    I believe so, yes.
17 (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)
18           MR. BELASIC:  That's her doctor.  That's
19      the only doctor that actually treated her.  The
20      only doctor that treated her for 22 years.  The
21      only doctor that saw her.  She could quit when
22      she was properly motivated.
23           Nicotine, whether you call it an addiction
24      or a habit, was not a substantial contributing
25      factor in her disease.  Everyone agrees that smoking was the cause of her disease.  But she
2      could quit.  Nicotine didn't make her smoke so
3      that she got a disease.
4           You know, I heard the analogy to a fish
5      story.  To me, the plaintiff's case sounds a lot
6      more like the runaway car that we all hear
7      about.
8           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
9           THE COURT:  Overruled.
10           MR. BELASIC:  You hear movies, whether it's
11      a runaway train or a runaway car, the guy is in
12      the car at the top of the mountain and he's
13      going down, and the brakes are cut or there's
14      something wrong with the steering wheel, it's
15      been tampered with.
16           No amount of motivation, no amount of
17      personal choice or decision can save our hero
18      then.  When there's a runaway car, you can't
19      steer, you can't brake, that crash is
20      inevitable.
21           But the evidence in this case is that
22      Fannie Collar wasn't strapped behind the
23      steering wheel of a runaway train.  She could
24      control her smoking when she did.  She could put
25      the brakes on and slow her smoking down. Mr. Geraghty reminded you, for seven years
2      when she worked for Ms. Gardiner, she could only
3      smoke a few cigarettes a day.  She had to work
4      the whole day there.  She was able to control
5      her smoking.
6           She was able to put the brakes on so much
7      that she could stop the car, we know 14 years,
8      no cigarettes, and no craving.  The last five or
9      six years she's quit for good.  She says she has
10      craving.  We know she can stop the car.  She
11      could stop the car at any time.
12           None of their experts, none of their
13      experts ever told you that her addiction or her
14      habit or her behavior was such that she was
15      prevented from quitting at any time.  She quit
16      for 14 years in '93.  There's no evidence she
17      couldn't quit at 83 or 73 or 63.  Her own expert
18      says, when she was properly motivated, she's
19      able to quit, nicotine or not.
20           I also wanted to show you what he says
21      about her COPD.  This is 2014, the medical
22      records that Mr. Hammer showed you this morning,
23      the most recent one was 2013.  Let's see what
24      her condition is as of August 2014.
25 (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as 5266d922-96e3-46b2-98de-23842feca467
1 follows:)
2      Q    Do you agree that plaintiff's signs and
3 symptoms for COPD have been and remain well managed
4 by appropriate medication?
5      A    Yes.
6 (Thereupon, the video ended.)
7           MR. BELASIC:  You've heard a lot about the
8      different warnings she got over the years.  I
9      don't want to discuss those just generally.  But
10      on the issue that Mr. Geraghty introduced to
11      you, you're going to be asked, did she rely on a
12      statement or misinformation?  Did she take
13      action in reliance on a statement or
14      misinformation?
15           We know Dr. Niaura said this.  He'd read
16      Merton Collar's sworn testimony.  Merton Collar,
17      he warned her every day.  Ms. Collar said that
18      never happened.  We know all about the co-worker
19      who said his wife got cancer.  Ms. Collar said
20      she didn't want to turn out like that.  He told
21      her, I don't want you to turn out like that.
22           We know she saw the warning but one of the
23      things she says, that it didn't tell her
24      anything she didn't already know.  We know her
25      father quit -- or her father-in-law quit. So here is these statements.  I just want
2      to go over again what -- Statements 3 and 4,
3      each of these questions that you're going to
4      answer says whether Ms. Collar reasonably relied
5      to her detriment on a statement or
6      misinformation by a defendant which concealed or
7      omitted material info.  Same thing.  Number 4,
8      did she rely to her detriment on a statement or
9      misinformation that concealed or omitted info?
10           As Mr. Geraghty was pointing out in both of
11      these, it's two parts.  It's did she rely, and
12      then look what's in the second half of the
13      sentence, whether such reliance on a statement
14      or misinformation was a legal cause of her lung
15      cancer and/or COPD.
16           Same thing on Question 4.  You have to
17      decide, did she actually see a statement,
18      believe it, and then rely on it?  And if she did
19      rely on it, did that reliance on a statement
20      actually cause -- was it the legal cause of her
21      lung cancer?
22           What does reliance mean?  What reliance
23      means is, plaintiffs have to prove that it can
24      reasonably be said that but for the reliance,
25      the injury would not have occurred.  Is there any evidence in this case, ladies and gentlemen,
2      that if the Tobacco Institute hadn't said
3      something in 1966 -- which is what Ms. Collar
4      claims she heard, she said in 1966 the Tobacco
5      Institute said something, is there any evidence
6      in this case that if the Tobacco Institute
7      didn't say it, that she would not have developed
8      lung cancer, any evidence that she would not
9      have developed COPD, any evidence at all by the
10      plaintiff that she would have quit smoking?
11           Even though she took the stand and told you
12      that she couldn't quit smoking all those years,
13      there isn't any evidence that would allow you to
14      answer yes to those questions.
15           The fraudulently conceal instruction is the
16      same thing.  They have to prove that but for the
17      reliance, she doesn't get lung cancer and she
18      doesn't get COPD.  What she told us is, many
19      years after she started smoking and many years
20      after she switched to filters, she saw a
21      statement from the Tobacco Institute, and as
22      Mr. Geraghty told you, she said it made no
23      impression.  He put the board with her sworn
24      testimony up there.
25           Same thing for material information. That's in the question.  They have to show that
2      but for concealment or omission of the
3      information, she wouldn't have acted as she did.
4           Well, here is the evidence that tells us
5      pretty clearly and it shows pretty clearly, she
6      didn't rely at all.  When she told her
7      husband -- and again, this is from Merton
8      Collar's sworn testimony that Dr. Niaura told
9      you, so either Dr. Niaura and Merton Collar got
10      it wrong -- because Ms. Collar says, well, that
11      never happened, but this is the testimony of her
12      expert, based on the sworn testimony of her
13      husband, she tells him, it's my decision to
14      smoke.  Mind your own business.
15           She never tells him, hey, I saw something
16      and I'm going to keep smoking because I'm
17      relying on it.  This supposedly happened every
18      day.  Dr. Niaura said it was part of her
19      husband's daily routine.
20           Does it make sense that if she was basing
21      30 years of smoking behavior on a statement that
22      she supposedly saw from the Tobacco Institute
23      that she wouldn't once mention it to the man
24      she's lived with for the last 40 years?  Does
25      that make sense? Mr. Geraghty asked her if she had ever
2      heard any statement by the companies, and she
3      said, again, it was the industry, and it was
4      this Tobacco Institute, 1966.  She said she'd
5      never heard a statement, couldn't remember
6      anything from Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds or
7      Liggett.
8           What did she hear?  What she said was,
9      Tobacco Institute, 1966, something about filters
10      and something about smoking not being bad for
11      you.  I put down here, she doesn't even claim
12      she heard any statement before 1966.
13           Now, how can I say that?  Because
14      Mr. Hammer showed you a slide that showed her
15      saying, well, I think it was '59.  Well, she
16      said she thought it was 1959, and then she was
17      questioned about it more.
18           And she said she remembered that it was
19      1966 when the Surgeon General's warning came
20      out.  Mr. Geraghty showed you his boards with
21      her sworn testimony.  She said, sir, it was
22      1966, when the warning came out, when her
23      father-in-law quit.
24           To be fair, we gave her one more chance.
25      The very last question she was asked by a defense lawyer, Ms. Collar, it was me, and the
2      very last question I asked was, I said, you told
3      us what you heard in 1966.  Do you have any
4      memory of hearing anything from anyone in the
5      tobacco industry before 1966?  If she did, she
6      could have and would have told us.  That was the
7      last question.
8           She said, no, nothing before '66.  So
9      there's no way she relies on that to start
10      smoking.  There's no way she can rely on
11      something that didn't occur in '66 until 1955.
12      Nobody has a time machine.  This isn't a
13      question of trying to confuse an older woman
14      about dates.  She herself said this didn't
15      happen until years after she switched.
16           Mr. Geraghty showed you, she flat out said
17      when asked, it made no impression.  These are
18      her words.  It made no impression on her.
19      Plaintiffs have to prove that -- not only that
20      she relied, but that she relied on a statement
21      and that that was the legal cause, but in this
22      case their own plaintiff has said it made no
23      impression on her.
24           When we were asked -- when she was asked,
25      she said she had never told her husband or her doctor that she relied on a statement.  So in 40
2      or 50 years on and off of smoking, in all of the
3      warnings, in all of the discussions she had with
4      her husband, with her father-in-law, when she
5      talked to her sister, anyone she talked to, with
6      all of her doctors, there's not a shred of
7      evidence that she ever once said, you know, I'm
8      relying on a quote from a tobacco company.  I
9      think cigarettes are perfectly safe.
10           Right at the start when Mr. Geraghty
11      examined her, she agreed that she said from '58
12      to '93, for 35 years she thought that cigarette
13      smoking was perfectly safe.  If that was true,
14      don't you think she would have mentioned that
15      even once.
16           As Mr. Geraghty says, there was no evidence
17      in this case that she ever claimed to have
18      relied on anything a tobacco company said until
19      this lawsuit was filed.  She never told her
20      doctors.  She never told her husband.  She never
21      discussed it with anyone, even when they were
22      asking her, why are you smoking?  You should
23      quit.
24           Now, I said, we don't have a time machine,
25      but what if there was a way we could do an experiment and find out, well, what would happen
2      if the tobacco companies had said, you know
3      what, we agree, smoking causes lung cancer.  We
4      agree it's addictive.  What would happen?  What
5      would Fannie Collar do?
6           We know.  Dr. Proctor told us in the late
7      '90s the companies began saying that smoking
8      causes lung cancer, COPD, it's addictive.  These
9      were public statements, a big deal.  Six, seven,
10      eight years later Ms. Collar smokes anyway.  It
11      didn't matter to Ms. Collar whether R.J.
12      Reynolds admitted in a newspaper or in a
13      magazine that smoking was addictive.  The
14      evidence is that had nothing to do with why she
15      smoked.  It had nothing to do with why she went
16      up again.
17           In the end, the plaintiffs failed to
18      present their proof.  Their burden of proof is
19      to show that she would have taken different
20      action if she had not relied on the statement.
21      There's no proof she would have stopped smoking
22      if the companies had said something differently.
23      She didn't even claim it herself.  There is no
24      proof that Ms. Collar would have avoided her
25      lung cancer if the companies had said something different.
2           You know, this isn't a case where you can
3      say, look, if you would have told me there was
4      mold in the house, I wouldn't have bought it.
5           MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
6           MR. BELASIC:  That's not this case.  She
7      didn't present any evidence --
8           THE COURT:  Overruled.
9           MR. BELASIC:  -- to meet the legal
10      instructions and the burden she has.  The truth
11      is, we know that even when the companies said it
12      caused cancer, it didn't change her mind.  She
13      went back to smoking at age 72.
14           So for that reason you should vote no on
15      each of Questions 3 and 4 because Ms. Collar did
16      not reasonably rely on a statement or
17      misinformation, and she certainly has not proven
18      that reliance on a statement was a real cause of
19      her lung cancer.  No expert said that.
20      Ms. Collar doesn't claim that when she took the
21      stand.  You should vote no on Questions 3 and 4.
22           I want to emphasize something that
23      Mr. Geraghty mentioned.  When you get the
24      verdict form, at the end of Questions 3 and 4
25      there will be an instruction.  It says, If you find for Ms. Collar on 3 or 4, if you vote yes
2      on either 3 or 4, that percentage fault, if you
3      even reach it, that percentage fault where you
4      have to determine what percentage she's
5      responsible for, what percentage R.J. Reynolds
6      is responsible for, that won't apply at all.
7      That percentage of fault will be wiped out.
8      There will be no reduction.
9           Again, we don't think you should even get
10      this far because the evidence is that whether
11      you call it nicotine or behavior or habit or
12      addiction, it wasn't a substantial contributing
13      factor.  It wasn't the legal cause of her
14      disease.
15           In the end, when she told her husband, it's
16      my decision to smoke, that wasn't a word that a
17      tobacco company lawyer put in her mouth.  That
18      was her own expert Dr. Niaura saying what her
19      own husband told her and what he heard her say.
20      Nobody put those words in her mouth.  She
21      believed it was her decision to smoke.  And it
22      was.  It was her choice.  When she made that
23      choice, it was her responsibility.
24           Let me leave you with this.  What was
25      different -- during the 14 years that she quit smoking from '93 to 2007 or so, what was
2      different about nicotine?  There wasn't anything
3      different about nicotine.  What was different
4      about the effects of nicotine for her?  It
5      wasn't.
6           What was different is that she didn't smoke
7      in year one and year two and year three.  What
8      changed was her mind.  She changed her mind in
9      1993 and she said with clear motivation, that I
10      was not going to smoke again.  When she changed
11      her mind, when she changed her behavior, when
12      she made a decision that Dr. Suen, her own
13      doctor, says was motivated, suddenly she did
14      quit.  All that talk of nicotine being
15      substantial or nicotine controlling you, she
16      wasn't smoking at all.
17           When you are asked to decide legal cause,
18      think about that.  Nicotine had no effect.
19      Nicotine wasn't a factor.  She didn't smoke at
20      all when she changed her mind, when she made
21      that motivated decision.  It's been a long
22      trial.  I thank you again for your service.
