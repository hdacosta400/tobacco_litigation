20           MR. BELASIC:  Thank you, Your Honor.
21           Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
22           I can't begin to thank you for sacrificing
23       three weeks out of your personal lives for this
24       trial.  So I say thank you.  I don't really now
25       how I can stress -- and of course I speak on

1       behalf of everyone.
2           Now, I have a lot of ground to cover too and
3       a lot of facts that you saw in this case.  I
4       can't speak as fast as Mr. Schlesinger.  But
5       let's start with one fact that is so obvious and
6       so indisputable that this fact actually is law,
7       because Judge Tuter instructs you.  It's legal
8       to make cigarettes and it's legal to sell them
9       and it's legal to advertise them.  It's not
10       legal because people think it's safe.
11           Our society has decided that even though
12       smoking causes cancer, like lung cancer and
13       larynx cancer, and even though nicotine is
14       addictive, our society has decided that it
15       should be legal.  And we know it's been legal to
16       sell cigarettes since before these companies
17       even existed.  It was legal to sell cigarettes
18       before Ms. Cooper even smoked.
19           Now, at the start of this case and what you
20       saw continuing here today, Mr. Johnstone and
21       Mr. Schlesinger said Mary Cooper grew up in this
22       rural area way back when, in the 1950s, and no
23       one knew, it was too far back in time, it was
24       too rural, no one knew the risks.  And the only
25       person they brought to testify on that was Mary

1       Cooper.  And when I cross-examined her, you saw
2       some of her admissions, and that really isn't
3       correct.  They didn't bring anybody else.
4           We brought you the eyewitnesses who knew
5       Ms. Cooper, in the case of her brother, loved
6       her, who saw what it was like in the 1950s and
7       '60s.
8           Let's start with her brother.  He's seven
9       years older than her.  He grew up in the 1950s,
10       before she even thought about smoking, and he
11       said, when he was growing up in the '50s, that
12       he was told, don't smoke, don't start.  He said
13       no one said smoking was good for you.  He's the
14       eyewitness, ladies and gentlemen.  And I could
15       yell these facts out and lawyers can yell, but
16       these facts speak loudly because they're from
17       the eyewitness.
18           His father told him not to smoke and he said
19       his father would have warned her.  She denies
20       that her father did, but he said her father
21       wasn't somebody who was promoting smoking.  He
22       was warning them not to smoke.
23           Same thing with his grandmother.
24           Let's see what Gary Cooper said.
25 5422
1 2     Q.    When did you first learn that smoking could
3 be hazardous to your health?
4     A.    Ah, I was told that from the time I can
5 remember.
6           (Video clip concluded.)
7 8 9     Q.    You testified that you believed that you
10 learned that smoking could be hazardous to your health
11 when you were a child.
12     A.    Uh-huh.
13     Q.    Was that common knowledge in your family,
14 that smoking could be bad for you?
15     A.    I don't think anybody ever said it was good
16 for you.  I never heard nobody say that.  Everybody
17 says, don't smoke if you never start, you know.
18           (Video clip concluded.)
19           MR. BELASIC:  So the first time her brother,
20       who grew up in the 1950s, remembers being told
21       smoking is hazardous to his health, he says, as
22       far back as I can remember, before Ms. Cooper
23       ever smoked.
24           Then we brought you her first husband.  And
25       remember he's the disinterested guy.  Remember

1       he kept saying, I just didn't want to be in it,
2       I didn't want to be in this side, but he went
3       out of his way to say, look, I'm not trying to
4       prevent her from winning, not trying to help
5       her.  Nobody disputes that he is disinterested
6       and neutral.  And he told us that everyone,
7       that's his word, everyone where he and
8       Ms. Cooper met and lived and grew up knew
9       smoking was dangerous in the 1960s.
10           He met her when she was 16 in high school.
11       That's the year she started buying cigarettes.
12       The warning was on the pack.  He's the
13       disinterested eyewitness.  He doesn't stand to
14       make any money off this lawsuit.
15           So what did he say?  He said they knew
16       smoking caused lung cancer in the '60s and even
17       more importantly he said that Ms. Cooper knew
18       it.  If she heard it, I heard it.
19 20 21     Q.    Do you agree that people knew that smoking
22 was dangerous in this era?
23           VOICE:  Form.
24           THE WITNESS:  Yes.
25     Q.    And people in your area where you lived?

1     A.    Yeah.
2     Q.    In your high school, correct?
3     A.    Yeah.
4     Q.    Did Mr. Cooper, Floyd Cooper -- was it
5 common knowledge at the time in your area that smoking
6 was dangerous?
7     A.    Everybody thought it was.
8     Q.    Did you think that it could cause lung
9 cancer when you were married to Mary Cooper?
10     A.    Oh yeah.  And different people had said that
11 they had had lung cancer and they thought it was from
12 smoking.
13     Q.    And you never told Mary that you thought
14 smoking might cause lung cancer when you were married
15 to her.
16     A.    No, because, like I say, she was old enough
17 that she would have knowed it herself.  If I heard it,
18 she would have heard it.
19           (Video clip concluded.)
20           MR. BELASIC:  They were married when she was
21       17 and still in high school.  She knew.  He says
22       everyone knew.  He's the disinterested neutral
23       witness who has no financial interest in the
24       outcome of this case.
25           That's what the facts are.

1           So when the plaintiff's lawyers describe the
2       tobacco companies as a monstrous conspiracy that
3       seduced everyone, that no one knew and led them
4       down a path to death, those aren't the facts of
5       how Mary Cooper grew up and what Mary Cooper
6       knew.
7           Here's what Mary Cooper's choices were.
8           We know she started because of family.  Her
9       brother saw the same ads.  Gary, he didn't
10       smoke.  Her husband Charles smoked.  He stopped.
11       They made different choices than her.  She
12       started because of family, not ads.
13           We know in the '50s, we just saw, her
14       brother said, everyone said, don't start
15       smoking, in the '50s.
16           We know that Mary Cooper said that in '64
17       she saw the news on the Surgeon General Report.
18       And look at her words, "it was everywhere."  And
19       then remember what her first husband said, that
20       everyone knew in the '60s, not just that it was
21       dangerous, but that everyone in their area, you
22       just saw the words, knew smoking caused lung
23       cancer.
24           We know the warning was on every pack she
25       bought.  We know, we just saw Charles Bray,

1       everyone knew it was dangerous and said it was
2       common knowledge that smoking caused cancer.
3       This is just when she's starting to be a regular
4       smoker.
5           The new warning came on the packs in 1970
6       and she ignored it.  She told me when I
7       cross-examined her that she read articles that
8       smoking was dangerous in the '70s, she heard the
9       American Cancer Society warnings, and we showed
10       you some of those, those were some of the ads,
11       Ed Asner, the Great American Smoke-Out, she said
12       she heard these warnings from the American
13       Cancer Society, but yet in the 1960s and the
14       1970s she never tried to quit.
15           You know, the plaintiffs keep saying, well,
16       she was 15.  She wasn't 15 forever.  She was 16,
17       21, 26, 31, 36, and year after year, week after
18       week, day after day she chose to go to the store
19       and buy cigarettes.
20           And she also chose not to quit.  In fact, we
21       know that for the first 25 years she chose to
22       not even try to quit, and then when she did,
23       what she says tried to quit, she chose to go an
24       hour and a half without smoking and then pick up
25       the cigarettes that she had never thrown away.

1           Now all of us have sympathy for the injuries
2       that Ms. Cooper has sustained, but you promised
3       to decide this case solely on the evidence.  And
4       when the plaintiffs argue, well, look what
5       happened to her choices, look at the evidence
6       about what the choices actually were and put
7       aside your sympathy.
8           We're going to talk more about marijuana,
9       but in the 1970s she was smoking both marijuana
10       and cigarettes.  She didn't stop smoking.  She
11       was now smoking two different things.  And we're
12       going to talk about why that's relevant here.
13           In the 1980s she told me that she continued
14       to read articles on the health risks of smoking.
15           In 1982 catches her daughter smoking in
16       either '82 or '83, and then I followed up and I
17       said, isn't it true that in 1982 you knew
18       smoking was dangerous for you?  And she said
19       yes.
20           And 1982 is a big date in this case.  It's
21       going to be all over your verdict form.  Just
22       remember that on the stand she said that in that
23       year she knew smoking was dangerous.  And of
24       course she knew smoking was dangerous since the
25       1960s.  Her husband who lived with her, who saw

1       her, who knew what she knew, said she did, said
2       she thought it caused lung cancer.
3           We know she wanted her daughter not to
4       smoke, that it was bad for her, that it was
5       addictive.
6           We know she told the dancers not to smoke.
7           Her father died of lung cancer.  And her
8       brother Gary, remember what he said, her father
9       was telling the family that his cancer was
10       caused by smoking.  And she got that warning in
11       1984, but did not even try to quit.
12           In 1985 the new pack warnings came out.  She
13       did not try to quit because of a warning.  When
14       I asked her, ladies and gentlemen, why didn't
15       you pay more attention to the warning, her first
16       answer to me was, why would I?  Why would I?
17       That's her words, not mine.
18           We know in the 1980s she stopped for a few
19       hours, and we know that Dr. Shapiro told her to
20       quit.  She said she would try, but we know that
21       she admits she did not even try when she got a
22       personalized warning.
23           She always knew the warning was there, and
24       the people that grew up when she did said
25       everyone knew it was dangerous, everyone knew it

1       could cause cancer, that's her husband,
2       including her.
3           And finally, we know, because she said on
4       the stand, that she admits she's a cause of her
5       own injury.  And the idea that a human being can
6       make a choice to smoke and the 60 million people
7       who have quit have made a choice to quit, the
8       plaintiffs belittle that.  They say no one is
9       responsible if they smoke.  Millions of people
10       quit but no one is responsible.  They say she's
11       only 5 percent responsible for her choices, the
12       choices that she made that were different than
13       other smokers who used a legal product and then
14       quit.
15           Now, she saw these news reports on the '64
16       Surgeon General's Report, and remember her
17       husband said that at that time that's when
18       everyone, quote, knew.  That report said that it
19       caused lung cancer and larynx cancer.  And we
20       asked her, she said she saw the news coverage
21       and here's what she said, of course she had seen
22       it, she heard, it was everywhere.  This is well
23       before she becomes a regular smoker.  This is
24       years before she starts buying the packs.  And
25       she said she had heard it and seen it and it was

1       everywhere.  And her husband tells us that
2       everyone in their community, in their community,
3       knew.
4           Here's the kind of news that we saw.  It
5       comes for both lung cancer and laryngeal cancer.
6       You've seen the pack warnings a million times.
7       But we all know that every single pack of
8       cigarettes she bought had the pack warning.  In
9       fact, she said, they've been on the pack since I
10       can almost ever remember, just like her older
11       brother who grew up in the '50s said he
12       remembers being told smoking was hazardous to
13       his health.  She lived a mile away.  Same
14       parents.  He lived a mile away, same parents, he
15       was told since the '50s.
16           Dr. Cummings, there was no dispute, he
17       agreed with me that every pack she ever bought
18       had that warning.
19           We all know the facts of why she started,
20       and I won't rehash them, but it was because her
21       brother John took cigarettes from her dad, in
22       her own words she said, he urged me to smoke, he
23       encouraged me to smoke.  She had not thought
24       about smoking before that moment.  She had not
25       taken cigarettes before that moment.  She had

1       not started smoking before that moment.  She
2       started smoking because of her family.
3           In this case Ms. Cooper from the stand did
4       not even claim that advertisements influenced
5       her choices of brand.  All of the cigarettes
6       they put up in their chart.  We cut it short.  I
7       was starting to ask Ms. Cooper about, are you
8       claiming that advertising is the reason you
9       smoked Belair or that you switched to Winston?
10       She cut it short and she said, I couldn't say
11       that.  That's her sworn testimony.  Her own
12       expert doesn't say anything different.  There
13       isn't evidence in this case that she smoked a
14       Kool or a Winston or any of the other brands
15       because she saw an ad.
16           And of course it was legal to advertise
17       cigarettes.  Even ads that we look at now we
18       think, that's the stupidest thing I've ever
19       seen, and the plaintiffs tell you, well, because
20       it was so different back then, because it was so
21       different back then you should assume no one
22       knew.  But the people who love her and the
23       people who are disinterested in this case, the
24       people who are the eyewitnesses, they say the
25       opposite.  They say everyone knew in the

1       community she grew up in.
2           Now, whether it's 60 million people who quit
3       or 57 million or 27 million or 37 million, the
4       issue and the truth that has been agreed by both
5       sides experts is that a huge amount of people
6       smoked and quit.  And the reason they quit is
7       not because they get thrown into jail or their
8       cigarettes are taken away from them.  Yes, some
9       of the people get sick and quit, but the reason
10       and the evidence is that the reason these people
11       quit is they make a choice to quit.  They wake
12       up and they say, I'm going to stop smoking.
13       These 60 million didn't quit by accident.
14           And when they argue that it's not a choice,
15       well, then why don't we have 150 million smokers
16       or 100 million smokers?  Dr. Cummings told you
17       there are more people who used to smoke and have
18       successfully quit in American today than there
19       are smokers.
20           And Dr. Cummings took the stand.  He said
21       this pamphlet he wrote for the American Cancer
22       Society tells you you can quit.  You can quit if
23       you want to, number one.  You can quit if you're
24       willing to make some changes to your daily
25       routine.  And you can quit if you're willing to

1       put up with some uneasy moments after stopping.
2           Well, the evidence is very clear that
3       Ms. Cooper wouldn't answer yes to those three
4       questions.  She wasn't willing to change her
5       routine.  She didn't make a serious effort to
6       quit.  She pushed her cigarettes aside for an
7       hour and a half keeping them in the house where
8       she knew she would return to smoking.  But
9       that's her choice.  That's her choice.  No one
10       is belittling that choice.  But the issue is,
11       does she get 22.3 million dollars, because
12       that's what they've asked for, 22.3 million
13       dollars, because she answered this
14       questionnaire, these questions differently than
15       the 60 million people who quit?
16           Dr. Cummings said addicted smokers quit
17       every day.  He said tens of millions of people
18       quit every day.  And the evidence is that this
19       is one of the most common health behaviors we
20       change in America.
21           You have people who are overweight.  You
22       have people who drink too much.  You have people
23       who don't exercise enough.  And people make
24       choices about whether they're going to change
25       their behavior.  But 60 million people is a

1       phenomenal number, and there's no evidence,
2       there's no evidence that Ms. Cooper was
3       different than these people, that there was
4       something different with her mind or her body,
5       there's no evidence at all.
6           Now, Dr. Cummings said anyone could quit.
7       He denied it.  And if you'll remember, right at
8       the -- he was on the stand for like two and a
9       half days with the plaintiffs.  And the first
10       things I asked him is these questions:  Isn't it
11       true you've said for years that anyone can quit?
12       He said absolutely not.  So I had to play the
13       video where he said those words, "anyone can
14       quit if they make up their mind to do it."
15           And I asked him, isn't it true that the quit
16       rate for motivated people who really want to
17       quit and stick to it is 100 percent?  And this
18       is again where I had to show him his video.  Was
19       this an obscure video that I found in some dusty
20       library in 1887?  No.  He said it was the
21       videotape that he taped to be used in the Engle
22       cases.  It's called his generic testimony that
23       they can play in all the trials.  So he knew
24       what he had said.  And that's what he said, if
25       you really stick to it and you're motivated the

1       success rate is 100 percent.
2           And the government agrees.  The government,
3       the consumer guide from the official U.S.
4       Department of Health and Human Services
5       Resources says the scientific study suggests
6       that everyone can quit smoking.  That's just
7       what Dr. Cummings said when we played his video.
8           Now, even though Ms. Cooper grew up in an
9       era where, according to her brother, everyone
10       said, don't smoke, don't start, and no one said
11       it was good for you, and even though her husband
12       says that starting from the time he met her in
13       high school in '67 that everyone knew it could
14       cause cancer and that everyone knew it was
15       dangerous, she made no effort to quit.  She
16       didn't want to.
17           And in the '70s that continued.  We know in
18       the '70s she was seeing the warnings that she
19       was reading, because she said that.  She was
20       seeing American Cancer Society warnings.  The
21       warnings were there on the pack.  But she never
22       tried to quit.
23           Now, Mr. Schlesinger was very effective at
24       painting a picture of a tortured agonized
25       quasi-drug addict when he described smokers.

1       And the impression that he was giving, when I
2       listened, is of someone who is desperately
3       trying to change their behavior to escape these
4       cigarettes and somehow they're being forced into
5       a lifetime of involuntary servitude to the
6       cigarette.  She didn't spend one minute of her
7       time trying to quit in the '60s and '70s.  Do we
8       blame her?  Blame is not about what this lawsuit
9       is about.  The truth is about what this lawsuit
10       is about.  And the true facts are she did not
11       want to make any effort to quit smoking in the
12       '60s '70s.  She wanted to smoke.  She enjoyed
13       it.  She said it relaxed her.  She said it
14       reduced boredom.  She was not a smoker who was
15       tortured, trying over and over and over again.
16           We tried to do the math with Dr. Agharkar
17       about how many hours she spent trying to quit an
18       hour and a half at a time on a handful of
19       occasions out of all those years.
20           But she made no effort at all in the '60s
21       and '70s.  And Dr. Cummings said if she had quit
22       smoking then she would have avoided her cancer.
23           In the 1980s, even when the pack warning
24       changed and her father died of lung cancer,
25       those warnings were not enough to make her

1       change her behavior.  She says that at some time
2       in the 1980s she used gum.  We don't know what
3       year that is, but we know that during the entire
4       1980s she believed smoking was dangerous.  She
5       was warning her daughter not to smoke.  She was
6       warning the dancers not to smoke.  Her husband
7       said she knew from the 1960s.
8           But when she bought the gum and she said she
9       tried cold turkey a few times, she would stop
10       for one to two hours.
11           You know that the Surgeon General of the
12       United States -- this is the 1988 report on
13       nicotine addiction that the plaintiffs use
14       repeatedly and that Dr. Cummings uses -- says,
15       less than 24 hours is not a serious quit
16       attempt.  They recommend a duration to define an
17       initial quit is 24 hours, but many scientific
18       investigators require longer, 48 hours or a
19       week.
20           Think about it compared to other substances.
21       We all know people who want to lose weight.  And
22       if someone told you that in 1984 they had gone
23       on a diet for an hour and a half.  They pushed
24       back the buffet table, they put the chocolate
25       cake to the side for an hour and a half, then

1       they ate it.  And then for five years they never
2       dieted.  And then they did it again for an hour
3       and a half they ate sensibly and then they went
4       back to their normal diet.  And they did it a
5       couple of times over the course of 35 years, or
6       four times over the course of 35 years.  Would
7       anyone think that that was a serious and
8       sustained effort to lose weight?  If a person
9       goes to the gym once, or goes on a treadmill
10       once in the 1970s or goes on a treadmill a
11       couple of times in the '80s, would anyone say
12       that that's a serious effort to exercise?
13       Because that's what the true facts in this case
14       are.  It's not blaming, it's what the plaintiff
15       herself has told us.  She didn't want to quit or
16       didn't want to quit, first of all at all in the
17       1960s or '70s, but certainly didn't want to quit
18       enough to make any sustained effort.
19           And our expert Dr. Agharkar, who is the only
20       doctor who is qualified to a give a medical
21       diagnosis of addiction, and the Surgeon General
22       himself say going an hour and a half without
23       smoking is not a quit effort at all.
24           Same thing in the '90s.  She doesn't know
25       when she used patches and she is the only

1       person, the only testimony that you heard that
2       said she did use patches.  There's no medical
3       record for it, no prescription, none of her
4       doctors noted that she had ever made any effort
5       to quit smoking, but she said she ignored the
6       instructions.  She was smoking and had the patch
7       on at the same time.  And, again, she would stop
8       for one or two hours and continue.  That was her
9       choice.
10           We know about Dr. Shapiro.  And she admitted
11       that while she told him she would try she did
12       not even try.
13           I heard the attacks on the warning today:
14       Oh, the warning is worthless, the warning is
15       worthless, the warning is worn out.  These are
16       clever phrases.  But here's the truth that
17       Dr. Cummings said, after the Surgeon General's
18       Report came out, 30 million people, that's
19       larger than the entire state of Florida, it's as
20       if everyone in Florida dramatically changed
21       their behavior in the same way, 30 million
22       people, that wasn't a worn-out warning, and she
23       heard it.  She admits it.  She said it was
24       everywhere.  I heard it, I seen, it was
25       everywhere.

1           And her husband said that when he met her in
2       the '60s she knew that it caused lung cancer.
3           She made a different choice than 30 million
4       other people.  And there's nothing wrong with
5       that.  But you don't get 22 million dollars for
6       making a different choice than other people
7       made.
8           Now, the pack warning, that came out in '66,
9       she had not even started buying cigarettes.  Was
10       it worthless?  In just four years 13 million
11       people quit.  That would be most of the state of
12       Florida.  In just four years 13 million people
13       quit.
14           And every time she saw the warning, and she
15       said she knew it was there all the time, whether
16       it was the '60s, '70s or '80s, she had a choice.
17       No one dragged her into the store.  Nicotine
18       didn't make her smoking involuntary.  She had a
19       choice to say, you know, it is dangerous to my
20       health.  It does cause cancer.  I've known this
21       since the '60s.  She had that choice to make, to
22       change her behavior.  And over the course of 35
23       years she spent one and a half hours times four
24       or five days.  That's her choice.  She lived
25       life the way she wanted to.  No one could tell

1       her what to do.
2           When I asked Dr. Cummings, do you have any
3       proof that if a tobacco company had said
4       something different, a tobacco company says,
5       well, we now agree that the statistics you have
6       are sufficient to prove disease, would that have
7       caused her to quit?  And he and I went back and
8       forth.  And I asked him, well, didn't you take
9       into account that her own daughter said you
10       can't encourage her to do anything and her
11       significant other, Robert Aaron, said, I
12       couldn't tell her to stop smoking because she'd
13       run me off, she liked those cigarettes.
14           Let me mention something here today.
15       Obviously all of the evidence from the
16       plaintiff's side that you have heard about
17       Ms. Cooper's personal smoking, apart from her
18       medical, comes from Ms. Cooper herself.  Now,
19       we've given you two eyewitnesses already, Gary
20       Cooper and Charles Bray, her first husband, but
21       there's a host of eyewitnesses who never came to
22       trial:  Her daughter, they called her her best
23       friend; her granddaughters, both of whom have
24       lived with her at various times; Robert Aaron,
25       the closest person in her life for 27 years, her

1       fiancé.
2           Did even one of these eyewitnesses who saw
3       her, who lived with her, who witnessed what she
4       said happened, did even one of these
5       eyewitnesses come in and corroborate her version
6       of events?  Because they have the burden of
7       proof, and right now there are no eyewitnesses
8       that corroborate what she says.
9           Her daughter didn't come in and say, well,
10       she tried to quit more times than that tobacco
11       lawyer says.  And Robert Aaron didn't come in
12       and say anything different than the facts that
13       I'm giving you, the facts you've seen were
14       proven.
15           The only eyewitnesses, her brother and her
16       first husband, completely contradict what she
17       said.  And think about the impact of that.  Why
18       does her brother say the exact opposite of what
19       she did, that everyone said, don't start?  Why
20       does her first husband say, everyone knew it
21       caused cancer when I was married to her?  And he
22       says, I'm disinterested.  I'm just telling you
23       the truth because I want to get out of here.
24           Now, Mr. Schlesinger said that I played a
25       joke or I made a joke.  You're going to decide,

1       all of you, whether I treated Mary Cooper with
2       disrespect or whether I was too harsh.  All of
3       you will decide, and you will either credit me,
4       punish me, et cetera.  But no one was joking
5       with Mary Cooper about marijuana use.  And
6       here's what it's relevant.  It's not because if
7       you smoke pot you're bad.  And it's not about
8       legality or whether Colorado legalized pot.
9       It's because she says she would never have
10       smoked if she was an adult.  Now, she started
11       smoking marijuana as an adult.  She can't say,
12       well, I started at 12 so I can never take
13       responsibility.  And that's their argument.
14       They say if you start young you never have more
15       than 5 percent responsibility, even when you're
16       smoking as an adult, year after year, day after
17       day, decade after decade.  That's their
18       position; she started young so she has no
19       responsibility.
20           Think what would happen to society if we
21       applied that, that everyone gets to sue the
22       McDonalds or the tobacco companies or the beer
23       companies --
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
25           MR. BELASIC:  -- and they say I started

1       before I'm 18.
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor.
3           THE COURT:  Legal basis.
4           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Talking about suing other
5       companies.  I talked about that too, but you
6       shut me down.
7           THE COURT:  Legal basis, please.
8           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Relevance.
9           THE COURT:  Sustained.
10           MR. BELASIC:  So the reason we're talking
11       about marijuana is it contradicts the
12       fundamental arguments.
13           I wouldn't do anything that can be dangerous
14       to my health as an adult.  She started smoking
15       marijuana as an adult.  It was an adult choice.
16           I'd never smoke if I wasn't forced too.  She
17       wasn't forced to smoke marijuana.  She enjoyed
18       it.  That's why people smoke pot.  She said it
19       was voluntary.  She said it was volitional.
20           She smoked it for almost 30 years -- or 20
21       years from the late '70s until 2000.  And
22       remember they make an enormous deal out of the
23       fact that before she had her laryngectomy she
24       had her last cigarette.  And that is absolutely
25       true.  And it's also probably the time you would

1       expect that she would have her last cigarette.
2       But marijuana that she chose to smoke
3       voluntarily as an adult because she enjoyed it,
4       we saw from the medical records she smoked
5       marijuana either the day or the night before her
6       surgery.  It's not because she's a bad person,
7       but, come on, this idea that the only reason I'm
8       smoking is because I'm a prisoner, you tricked
9       me and no one has control over my life and I get
10       22 million dollars.  If you look at all of the
11       decisions she made about marijuana it just -- it
12       defies reality.
13           That's the evidence.  Her husband said they
14       smoked an ounce of marijuana a week in the mid
15       to late 1970s.  She agreed that she continued to
16       smoke it in the '80s, including with family
17       members, her brother's girlfriend.  The medical
18       records show she continued to smoke marijuana,
19       and she was still smoking marijuana in 2000.  So
20       even though she had the polyps removed and even
21       though she had the throat surgery and the neck
22       surgery, she continued to smoke, not just
23       cigarettes, but voluntarily smoking marijuana as
24       well.
25           Those are the medical records.  This is

1       right in between her two surgeries.  That's the
2       day of the surgery, 2-24-97, when she has her
3       lymph nodes removed.  And here's the form that
4       says she continued to smoke until the year 2000.
5           I won't go over this.  You saw the
6       testimony.  You'll believe it -- or believe
7       whatever you want to, but you're the judges of
8       this.  We saw the testimony with the irregular
9       cigarette in the ashtray and the glass tube at
10       the time.
11           Now, Mr. Schlesinger preempted me and said,
12       well, this is ridiculous; the instruction for
13       legal cause doesn't say it.  But then,
14       ironically, he put up the judge's instruction
15       for legal cause.  And I want all of you to check
16       it, because Judge Tuter gives you the actual
17       language.  And even when Mr. Schlesinger read
18       it, you know what it says, it says to be a legal
19       cause it has to cause something in a direct and
20       continuous fashion, direct and continuous.  And
21       that's why those two are up there.
22           And then it says it also has to be a
23       substantial cause.  But it's not just one or
24       two; it's all three of these.  To be a legal
25       cause, addiction needs to directly,

1       continuously, substantially cause larynx cancer.
2           So let's look at the verdict form.  The
3       first question you're going to be asked is:
4       "Was she addicted and was that addiction a legal
5       cause of her laryngeal cancer?"
6           And I'm going to focus on that issue of
7       legal cause.  You'll decide both parts, but that
8       question has two parts.
9           Right off the bat she admits she was a cause
10       of her own injury, so we know that she caused
11       her own injury.  She says she was a partial
12       cause.  She says the tobacco companies were also
13       a cause.  But think about what it means.  She
14       says she caused her own larynx cancer and she
15       admits that on the stand; although the
16       plaintiffs now say apparently she only caused 5
17       percent, because that's the responsibility
18       they're taking for, only 5 percent for her to
19       smoke all those years.
20           How can she cause her own cancer if she has
21       no ability to quit?  When they say and when she
22       says, I'm a partial cause of my own cancer, she
23       has to be admitting that she could quit smoking,
24       because that's the only way she could cause it.
25       If she can't quit then she's not a cause.  It

1       wouldn't be her fault.  She could have quit
2       smoking.
3           So I don't know which of the many insults I
4       heard, I don't know if Dr. Agharkar is the liar
5       or if he's ridiculous or he's the preposterous
6       ridiculous liar, I'm not sure.  You are the
7       judges of his credibility.  But he's board
8       certified in psychiatry and forensic psychiatry.
9       And he told you why we brought him, only
10       psychiatrists, the only person who is qualified
11       to give a medical diagnosis of addiction in this
12       case has been Dr. Agharkar.
13           Now, sure they say we brought in some of her
14       treating physicians and they said the word
15       "addicted."
16           One of them was Dr. Shapiro.  Remember what
17       Dr. Shapiro said?  Why do you, Dr. Shapiro --
18       he's not an addiction expert.  He treats head
19       and neck cancers.  He's not an addiction expert.
20           But why do you think she's addicted?  And he
21       said, well, she must have been addicted because
22       I told her to quit and she tried to quit, she
23       tried to quit, and she continued to smoke after
24       those surgeries.  You see, Dr. Shapiro didn't
25       have all the information.  He had, what, one

1       inch -- remember when Crane Johnstone, calling
2       our witness, maybe the lawyers, liars because
3       only one inch of documents or something was
4       given to the plaintiffs.  He didn't go through
5       the 10,000 medical records, but we know he
6       definitely didn't have the sworn deposition
7       testimony because even today, in 2014, he
8       believed that after he told her to quit smoking
9       he believed, he said on the stand, she tried to
10       quit.  We know she didn't.  She admitted when
11       her doctor warned her she didn't try to quit.
12       Dr. Shapiro didn't have that information, but
13       Dr. Agharkar did.
14           And Dr. Agharkar testified that she could
15       have quit smoking at any time.  And there isn't
16       evidence, there's no scientific evidence in this
17       case that she lost the ability to quit like the
18       other 60 million.  He said she was never
19       motivated to quit.  And you've seen the
20       evidence.  She never put in more than an hour
21       and a half, more than an hour and a half of
22       effort a few times over 35 years.  And then of
23       course she stopped in 2001.
24           Now, if you had the ability to quit
25       smoking -- the plaintiffs can put up all the

1       charts they want.  They get addiction and then
2       there's four or five squares.  But if you had
3       the ability to quit doing something that injures
4       you and you can stop if you make up your mind,
5       then that thing they're suing, that thing
6       they're attacking, that's not the cause of your
7       injury.  If you can stop, if you can get out of
8       the room, if you can avoid the danger, that
9       thing they're attacking, in this case what
10       they're suing, that's not the cause of your
11       injury.
12           She wasn't trapped in the car with no brakes
13       racing down a hill with no ability to control.
14       She had the ability to quit smoking.  And you
15       know what, she indirectly admits it when she
16       says, I admit that I'm a cause of my own cancer.
17       And that's been their position from the very
18       beginning.  She can't admit she's a partial
19       cause of her cancer without admitting she could
20       have quit.  We know she never really tried to
21       quit, and that's under the Surgeon General's
22       definition; it's not some tobacco company rule
23       or some expert who you have to pay for their
24       time.  The Surgeon General says, if you don't
25       try to quit for at least 24 hours, even the

1       Surgeon General doesn't consider it a serious
2       effort.  She never relapsed because she never
3       officially quit smoking.
4           What she did -- think about what an hour and
5       a half of smoking means.  It means skipping two
6       or three cigarettes.  That's what it means.
7       It's not really quitting smoking.  It's saying,
8       well, I deferred or I delayed smoking for 90
9       minutes.  The lawyers are going to talk a lot
10       longer than 90 minutes.  It's about the length
11       of a movie, and that's all the effort she would
12       make, a few hours over the course of 30 or 40
13       years.
14           She didn't have any withdraw.  That's not
15       why she continued to smoke.  Now, she says after
16       she quit in 2001 she was crabby; of course she
17       didn't go back to smoking.  But during those
18       times when she quit for an hour and a half she
19       doesn't claim that she had some physical
20       withdrawal.
21           The only expert they called, Dr. Cummings,
22       who's not even a medical doctor, he didn't claim
23       that she had some significant withdrawal.
24       That's not what you see in addiction.  That's
25       not what you see in the official diagnosis.

1       That's why we brought Dr. Agharkar to actually
2       apply the medical criteria.
3           And she smoked even when she had nicotine
4       replacement.  Patches and gum used over a period
5       of days so that she'd have enough nicotine in
6       her system to simulate smoking.  She wasn't
7       missing the nicotine.  She started smoking and
8       kept smoking for something else.  We know she
9       said on the stand that smoking relaxed her and
10       was a habit that reduced boredom.
11           Now, Dr. Cummings was brought in, I guess,
12       to say both addiction and to give an opinion
13       that she relied on something.  He's not a
14       medical doctor.  He admits he can't give that
15       diagnosis.  You want to talk about money,
16       Mr. Schlesinger says that Dr. Cummings is a
17       hero.  I'm not taking a position.  I'm not
18       telling you what to believe about that.  But
19       what we know is that he's made a fortune, a
20       fortune in lawsuits that sue tobacco companies.
21       1 million dollars in less than the last five
22       years.  And unlike our experts, unlike our
23       experts, he goes to a conference for lawyers who
24       sue the tobacco companies to give them a speech
25       and help them better sue.  And unlike our

1       experts, he says he is biased and he wants to
2       get money.  And so when Mr. Schlesinger was
3       screaming out, I'm in the war on tobacco and I
4       want to be in that war, it's not the fact that
5       he used the war on tobacco, big deal.  I
6       understand he wants everyone to quit smoking,
7       and that would be a good idea.  But what he said
8       is he admits bias and that he wants her to win
9       money.  And he makes a million dollars in less
10       than five years as basically a part-time job
11       coming into every one of these cases and saying
12       that smokers are addicted.
13           Well, what does the Surgeon General say?
14       Does the Surgeon General say addiction is the
15       cause of your cancer?  Is there something --
16       does addiction actually directly cause the cells
17       in your body to change into cancer cells?  No,
18       that's not what the Surgeon General says.  Look
19       at the title.  This is the 2010 Surgeon
20       General's Report, tobacco smoke causes disease.
21       Of course if there's going to be a cause it's
22       going to be the smoking.  And there's no
23       evidence, there's no evidence from any doctor
24       who's qualified to give a diagnosis of addiction
25       that addiction caused her disease instead of the

1       cigarettes.
2           Look what the Surgeon General says.  It
3       talks about tobacco dependence.  Tobacco
4       dependence.  And they're saying, what does
5       tobacco dependence/nicotine dependence have to
6       do with the risk of relapse?  Is it significant?
7       Is it substantial?  Because that's what they
8       have to prove.  He says, no, tobacco dependence
9       is only a modest amount of variation in the risk
10       of relapse.
11           So what does the Surgeon General say is the
12       most important thing about whether a person will
13       quit or continue?  Personal factors, not
14       dependence.  The Surgeon General here is saying
15       that the prediction of whether you're going to
16       successfully quit depends more on the person's
17       factors than it does on nicotine dependence.
18           And I asked Dr. Cummings -- he wrote part of
19       this book.  This is the National Cancer
20       Institute from right after Ms. Cooper quit
21       smoking.  And it says that the people who quit,
22       the people who quit weren't less addicted than
23       the people who continued.  And the people who
24       continued to smoke, what, under their theory
25       you'd expect the people who keep smoking to be a

1       lot more addicted than these people who quit.
2       They found just the opposite.  The remaining
3       smokers are no more addicted than those who
4       stopped.
5           Now, I do want to talk a little about the
6       risk factors.  They asked, the plaintiff's
7       lawyers, as you can see in the depositions,
8       asked their doctors about a variety of alternate
9       causes and alternate risk factors for cancer.
10       But since you need all of the evidence, I want
11       to point out some of the evidence that came even
12       from the plaintiffs.  We know that smoking and
13       alcohol are risk factors.  We heard our expert
14       testimony that the workplace exposures could be.
15       And you saw the sad testimony of Charles Bray,
16       her first husband, and what happened to him
17       working in cotton mills, like the cotton mills
18       that she worked in in the '60s and in the '70s.
19       Their own expert said that marijuana use could
20       be a risk factors.  And their own experts said
21       that HPV is a risk factor for head and neck
22       cancer, including, especially they said larynx
23       cancer.
24           These are the four doctors that you heard
25       from.  That's the plaintiff's doctors.  They all

1       said alcohol is a risk factor.
2           Now, again, Mr. Schlesinger tries to act
3       like it's some sort of smear campaign.  No one
4       ever said that Mary Cooper drank too much, and
5       no one ever said that she had a drinking problem
6       or that she's an alcoholic.  What their experts
7       admitted is the fact that if you drink and if
8       you are more than an occasional drinker it
9       increases the chances that you will get the type
10       of cancer that she developed.
11           Now, this is her own doctor.  Remember
12       Dr. Shapiro, he was the only doctor that came in
13       live, and he was the doctor who said in '96 and
14       '97 that she did not have larynx cancer.  He
15       listed two problems for her cancer.  One is her
16       former smoking and the other is her alcohol use.
17       And when I asked Ms. Cooper, well, he must have
18       told you don't have a few drinks a day anymore
19       once you have this cancer, she denied it.  She
20       said, no, he never talked to me about that.  But
21       he thought that alcohol use was significant
22       enough that he listed it as a problem for her
23       disease.
24           HPV, the plaintiff's lawyers were asking
25       their experts about HPV, not just defense

1       lawyers.  All of them said that human papilloma
2       virus is a risk factor for larynx cancer.
3           Dr. Weed, they just showed you a clip.
4       Dr. Weed, the doctor who treated her starting in
5       2001, he gave this testimony, that marijuana use
6       is commonly associated with HPV in head and neck
7       cancers.
8 9 10     Q.    Is marijuana a risk factor for head and neck
11 cancers?
12     A.    Again, not well-established.  It's more
13 commonly associated with HPV-positive cancers, but it's
14 not clear whether that's an epidemiologic behavioral
15 risk versus an actual causative risk.
16           (Video clip concluded.)
17           MR. BELASIC:  We know what the doctor's
18       opinions are.  And we asked Dr. Weed, is there
19       some test, is there scientific evidence, do you
20       actually have proof other than your opinion as
21       to what the cause of smoking is [sic], and of
22       course they pointed out, our experts said that
23       smoking is a risk factor and that smoking was
24       the biggest risk factor.  But unlike what
25       Mr. Johnstone said, we didn't have to pry it out

1       of them.  We addressed the issue.  We had our
2       experts be up front and tell you what they
3       thought.
4           We asked Dr. Weed, do you actually have
5       proof that it was caused by smoking and not just
6       your opinion, and here's what he said.
7 8 9     Q.    Do you have any proof that Ms. Cooper's
10 tumor was caused by smoking?
11     A.    I have no proof.
12           (Video clip concluded.)
13           MR. BELASIC:  Now, Dr. Mudad, that's her
14       doctor that started treating her in 2008, and,
15       again, these are plaintiff's experts, ladies and
16       gentlemen, and I'll talk more about what
17       Mr. Johnstone said about our experts versus
18       theirs.
19           But here's Dr. Mudad saying that it's
20       possible her cancer was caused by HPV.
21 22 23     Q.    But you would agree that it's possible that
24 her cancer was caused by HPV?
25     A.    It is possible, yes.

1           (Video clip concluded.)
2           MR. BELASIC:  So at the end, the real
3       question on verdict form question 1 is whether
4       addiction, not the cigarette smoking, but was
5       addiction a cause of her cancer.  And she had
6       the ability to quit.  And the Surgeon General
7       himself says that smoking is the cause.  Had she
8       quit smoking, as her own expert Dr. Cummings
9       said, she could have avoided her cancer.  It
10       wasn't addiction.  It was a series of choices
11       from the '60s, the '70s, the '80s and the '90s.
12       The 60 million people who quit and avoided their
13       disease, they weren't caused by addiction to do
14       anything.  The issue really is, did she have the
15       ability to quit.  And she admits it, her own
16       experts admit it.  Addiction isn't the cause of
17       her cancer.  Even if smoking is, it's smoking
18       that's the cause.  And so you should vote no on
19       question one.
20           Now, question two is this question of
21       manifestation.  Her cancer has to manifest
22       before November '96.
23           Your Honor, if I could just interrupt?
24           How far along am I, Dennis?
25           MR. MURPHY:  You have 55 and a half minutes

1       left.
2           MR. BELASIC:  Okay.
3           THE COURT:  A half minute?
4           MR. BELASIC:  All right.  So Dr. Shapiro was
5       the first doctor to testify with Mr. Johnstone,
6       and he found she didn't have larynx cancer in
7       '96 or '97.  But when we cross-examined him, we
8       found out that he had given a completely
9       different opinion under oath before he came to
10       this stand.  And here's what happened:  At his
11       deposition under oath, and he agreed, he said,
12       can you say that Ms. Cooper developed larynx
13       cancer in 1996 to a reasonable degree of medical
14       certainty?  And his answer was no.  He was under
15       oath.  This is before trial.  This is her
16       doctor, no.  You answer question two no because
17       that's what Dr. Shapiro said, at least before
18       the lawyers got ahold of him.
19           Look what he said.  Crane Johnstone and Jon
20       Gdanski, the two lawyers you've seen, went and
21       talked to him in the hallway.  This is in the
22       middle of his testimony before trial.  He's
23       under oath and they're talking to him in the
24       hallway.  He said, they told me that the
25       plaintiff needed to prove that the cancer

1       manifested before November '96.  He said they
2       told me it was urgent.  Did he tell them, that's
3       too bad, I already gave my sworn testimony and I
4       told the truth?
5           Well, we don't know what he told them, but
6       we know what he did when he came back.  He came
7       back and apologized.  What was he apologizing
8       for?  For telling the truth under oath?  Why
9       would he apologize?  Well, he changed his
10       answer.  And only then, only then did he say
11       that Ms. Cooper had larynx cancer in '96.
12           So let's put Dr. Shapiro, put the doctors'
13       names up here.  Did the cancer manifest in '96,
14       or did it manifest later up to 2001?
15           Dr. Shapiro says he can say no.  That's what
16       he gives under oath.  Then Mr. Johnstone and
17       Mr. Gdanski talk to him and he does a 180 and he
18       says yes.  Crane Johnstone stood in front of you
19       and said that anyone, anyone who said that it
20       started in 2001 is a liar.  He said that no one
21       in this case other than our paid experts, who he
22       called liars over and over and over again, he
23       said that no one in this case said that her
24       cancer manifested in 2001 except these horrible
25       paid liars.

1           Let's see what the truth is.  We know in '96
2       and '97 they inspected her with a microscope.
3       They looked at the larynx.  They took the
4       biopsies.  So they looked at the microscopic
5       level and the cellular level and they found no
6       larynx cancer.  Everyone agrees on that.
7           We know that in '97 they diagnosed her
8       cancer as cancer of an unknown primary, not
9       larynx cancer.
10           And they asked Ms. Cooper about symptoms.
11       And here's what Ms. Cooper said on the stand.
12       Here's what she said on the stand, that from
13       '97, '98 and '99 she didn't have problems of
14       hoarseness until she reported them sometime in
15       the year before 2001, so i.e., 2000.  Well, the
16       plaintiff's theory is that she always had larynx
17       cancer.  Their theory is that they missed it and
18       that she always had larynx cancer.  And they
19       have to prove that she had these symptoms of
20       larynx cancer.  Well, if she always had it, why
21       did the hoarseness go away?  She didn't have
22       these symptoms.  And that's why Dr. Fee said it
23       makes no sense.  If she had larynx cancer
24       undiscovered all the way up till 2001 she would
25       have had a host of symptoms, but she didn't.

1           In 2000 when she really had larynx cancer
2       she had difficulty swallowing.  Dr. Fee, the guy
3       they call a liar, explained exactly why that is.
4       She didn't have that symptom in '96 and '97.
5       She was hoarse because she had polyps, which
6       everyone agrees are not cancer.  She had polyps
7       on her vocal cord.  Everyone agrees.  That's why
8       she was hoarse.  She didn't have the real
9       symptoms of larynx cancer until 2000.  Throat
10       tightening, she didn't have that symptom until
11       2000.  And throat pain she reported in 2000, but
12       not in '96 and '97.
13           Her medical records say that she was doing
14       well up until 2001 and she was apparently well
15       in follow up.  Patient was fine until 2001.
16           And then look, May 2001 it says that the
17       hoarsening started over the course of the past
18       year.  That's 2000.  That's three years -- four
19       years after the cutoff.
20           And here's this Miami questionnaire.
21       Mr. Johnstone used this extensively.  She only
22       had symptoms for nine to ten months before 2001.
23       Tightness in my throat, nine to ten months
24       before 2001.  But their theory is that she
25       always had larynx cancer, in '96, in '97, in

1       '98, in '99 and 2000.  Then why didn't she have
2       any symptoms in '97, '98, '99?  Again, these are
3       her own records and this is her own testimony.
4       It wouldn't matter if the defendants had never
5       put on experts.  That's her own records.  It
6       wasn't until nine to ten months before 2001 that
7       she started having the real symptoms of larynx
8       cancer.
9           Now, when Mr. Johnstone tells you that every
10       doctor agrees with him, he never lists these
11       three doctors.  These are the three
12       pathologists.  They're the only doctors who are
13       qualified to determine whether something is
14       cancerous.  Everyone agreed that a biopsy is the
15       gold standard.  And these three doctors,
16       Dr. Kraemer, Dr. Caplivski and Dr. Nadji, said
17       no larynx cancer in '96, '97.
18           And they never found her lung cancer was
19       recurrent.  They never said, hey, we don't have
20       enough material, we need a bigger biopsy, that
21       the plaintiffs keep harping on.  That's their
22       excuse.  They say it was invisible but there
23       wasn't enough of a biopsy.  Well, these were
24       their own doctors.  These doctors never said the
25       biopsy wasn't enough.  They don't agree.  These

1       pathologists didn't come into court.  And it's
2       pretty obvious, ladies and gentlemen, the
3       plaintiff's lawyers picked who to bring in.
4       They bought in four doctors, three by video and
5       one live.  But she had a ton of doctors.
6           We're going to see, the other doctors didn't
7       agree with them, just like Dr. Shapiro didn't
8       agree with the plaintiffs when he was under oath
9       until they talked to him and he changed his
10       testimony.
11           MR. MURPHY:  Mark, 50.
12           MR. BELASIC:  Okay.
13           They say Ms. Cooper's doctors missed it, but
14       in an ironic way that proves our theory.  If
15       they missed it it means there wasn't enough
16       symptoms, it wasn't clinically evidenced.  There
17       wasn't enough evidence to find that it even
18       existed.  They have to show it was manifested;
19       yet their doctors said things like, it wasn't
20       clinically evident until 2001.  One of their
21       doctors, Dr. Weed, said it was an occult or a
22       hidden tumor.  Well, hidden, that's the opposite
23       of manifest.  If they missed it then by
24       definition the cancer wasn't manifest.  Their
25       own doctors said, well, the cancer didn't reveal

1       itself until 2001.  And if you look at the
2       verdict form, the question is not when did it
3       start, because nobody knows; the question is not
4       did she have it.  They have to prove that it
5       started and she had it but that it was manifest.
6       So here's what the evidence, they brought in
7       Dr. Weed, and I think he probably was the
8       longest of the doctors to testify by video, he
9       agreed she didn't have cancer in '96.  He said
10       that he couldn't say the cancer developed in an
11       area where the biopsies --
12 13 14     Q.    ...involved the area where biopsies were not
15 taken for fear of (inaudible)?
16     A.    My note specifically does not specify the
17 anterior commissure whether it's involved or not.  So I
18 can't say (inaudible) about that.
19           (Video clip concluded.)
20           MR. BELASIC:  So he doesn't back up their
21       theory that, well, there was cancer that wasn't
22       visible, we just must have missed it.  He
23       doesn't back that theory up.
24           Now, look what he says.  She didn't develop
25       a cancer that was clinically evident, clinically

1       evident.  Clinically means when you're treating
2       a patient you evaluate their symptoms, you do
3       tests on them.  It wasn't clinically evident
4       until years after the deadline.
5 6 7     Q.    Okay.  And is this cancer?  I want
8 (inaudible) clear.  Did they find cancer in January of
9 1996?
10     A.    They did not.
11     Q.    Okay.  Is there a continuum on which cells,
12 normal cells turn into cancer cells?
13     A.    Yes, there is.
14     Q.    Okay.  And how would you characterize the
15 cells seen here in January of 1996 knowing what you
16 know based on what you did in 2001 and the operation
17 you performed for Mary?
18     A.    I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
19     Q.    Sure, I will.
20           How would you characterize what we're seeing
21 here taking place in 1996, the dysplasia, on that
22 continuum of cancer changing cells knowing that she
23 eventually had recurrent disease in that area, in your
24 medical opinion?
25     A.    This is an early precancerous change of the

1 vocal cords.  It's a precancerous change in an area
2 where she did ultimately develop cancer that was
3 clinically evident some years later.
4           (Video clip concluded.)
5           MR. BELASIC:  So in '96 it was precancerous.
6       It wasn't cancer.  It didn't become clinically
7       evident till years later.  I know you all
8       recognized that was Mr. Gdanski.  No one was
9       tricking their doctor.  Dr. Weed said, no cancer
10       in '96 and it wasn't clinically evident till
11       years later.
12           Then he said that he can't rule out that in
13       2001 it was a completely new cancer.  This is
14       their expert.
15 16 17     Q.    Dr. Weed, is it possible that after
18 Ms. Cooper's 1997 left neck mass was treated that along
19 with the radiation therapy she received at the time her
20 primary tumor was cured and her 2001 cancer was a new
21 primary cancer?
22     A.    It is possible.
23     Q.    You cannot rule out that Ms. Cooper's 2001
24 cancer was not a new primary, correct?
25     A.    I cannot rule that out.

1           (Video clip concluded.)
2           MR. BELASIC:  Okay.  So, I mean, we may be
3       thinking, he can't rule it out, big deal, that
4       just speculations.  Let's just get down to brass
5       tacks.  Let's just ask Dr. Weed, their expert,
6       did the cancer first manifest in 2001.  And he
7       says, yes, it did.
8 9 10     Q.    And similarly, you'd agree that there is no
11 evidence in the records you reviewed that any doctor
12 told Ms. Cooper that she had a smoking-related cancer
13 prior to 1997, correct?
14     A.    Correct.
15     Q.    And I think you also said that 2001 is the
16 first time the primary site of Ms. Cooper's cancer was
17 determined by her doctors, correct?
18     A.    Correct.
19     Q.    In other words, that is the first time that
20 Ms. Cooper's primary cancer manifested to her or her
21 doctors, correct?
22     A.    Correct.
23           (Video clip concluded.)
24           MR. BELASIC:  That's their own doctor, 2001
25       is the first time it manifested to her or her

1       own doctors.  Now, that answer and Dr. Shapiro's
2       answers under oath mean you vote no on number 2.
3       Now, they can say, wait a second, when we asked
4       questions, he said something different.  We
5       asked him and he said something different.  It's
6       their burden of proof.  We've already got two of
7       their doctors that don't agree.  And none of the
8       pathologists ever reached the conclusions that
9       Mr. Johnstone has been arguing.
10           Now, her own doctors couldn't agree.
11       Dr. Shapiro said that her own doctors didn't
12       agree on whether the lung cancer was a new
13       primary or whether it came from the larynx.
14       Mr. Johnstone told you it was all the same
15       cancer.  That's not what Dr. Shapiro said.  He
16       said the lung cancer was a new primary and not
17       from the larynx.  And, again, that was in his
18       deposition.  Then he said something different at
19       trial.
20           Dr. Weed was very clear:  Her lung cancer
21       was not part of this continuous pattern.  It
22       didn't relate to her larynx cancer.  It was new.
23 24 25     Q.    Now, without getting into all of the

1 records, we'll look at some, but did you see records
2 that discussed whether or not it was related to
3 laryngeal cancer or whether it was an actual primary
4 lung cancer?
5     A.    Yes.
6     Q.    Okay.  And what's your conclusion and
7 opinion in that regard?
8     A.    My opinion certainly now is that it was a
9 separate primary lung cancer.
10     Q.    Why is that?
11     A.    Because she appears to have been cured of
12 that cancer.  She had two masses in the lungs, which
13 raises concern for spread rather than new primary.  But
14 the appearance of those two nodules was more consistent
15 with two primary lung cancers based on the
16 radiologist's interpretation and the simple fact that
17 she's still alive this far out after treatment almost
18 never happens for a throat -- or head and neck cancer
19 that spread to the lung.
20           (Video clip concluded.)
21           MR. BELASIC:  That's their own doctor saying
22       something that is the exact opposite of what
23       Mr. Johnstone has been saying from the beginning
24       of this trial.  And we just saw him call
25       everyone in this case that disagrees with him

1       and what he said the doctor said a liar.
2       Absolutely not true.
3           Dr. Mudad said he has no scientific proof of
4       when her cancer arose and that it would be
5       speculation to suggest a specific date that her
6       cancer arose before 1997.  And I'm just going to
7       skip ahead and cut to the chase with what
8       Dr. Mudad said.
9           He then said, if her cancer did arise before
10       '97, and they have to prove it, he couldn't be
11       sure where in the head and neck, couldn't be
12       sure if it was larynx cancer.  He admitted that.
13       Then he said he can't say one way or the other
14       whether the 2001 cancer was the same cancer.
15       Listen to what he says here.
16 17 18     Q.    Do you believe that the unknown primary head
19 and neck cancer from early 1997 that we've been
20 discussing is the same cancer that then became her
21 laryngeal cancer in 2001?
22     A.    Well, there are two possibilities, and I
23 don't know that I can prove either one, or anybody can.
24 She could have had an unknown primary in '97 and then a
25 second new primary in the pyriform sinus in 2001, or it

1 could have been the 2001 cancer that manifested in 2001
2 was subclinical in 1997.
3           (Video clip concluded.)
4           MR. BELASIC:  You know, it's easy to come
5       into court and say, look, we played 20 hours of
6       the treating doctors' depositions and just
7       assert they agree with us, because there's no
8       way you can memorize everything or take enough
9       notes.  But it's reckless to come in and start
10       calling everyone liars when their own doctors
11       are saying that.  He says there's two
12       possibilities, it could have spread from '96 or
13       it could have been a new one, and I can't say
14       either way.
15           We know he just said that she had primary
16       cancer in her sinus, not the larynx.  Of course
17       that's the complete opposite of their theory.
18       He tried to say, well, the sinus and the larynx,
19       we treat them the same, but he admitted, this
20       isn't a case about sinus cancer.  She has no
21       right under the Engle case to sue for sinus
22       cancer.  He said it was sinus cancer, not larynx
23       cancer.
24           Let's cut to the chase.  Dr. Mudad, when is
25       the first year that you as a treating physician

1       of Ms. Cooper, when is the first year you can
2       say to a reasonable degree of medical certainty
3       that she had larynx cancer?  Does he say '96, or
4       does he say 2001?
5 6 7     Q.    Is the first year that you can testify to a
8 reasonable degree of medical certainty that Ms. Cooper
9 had laryngeal cancer 2001?
10     A.    Yes.
11           (Video clip concluded.)
12           MR. BELASIC:  That's the third doctor that
13       they brought to trial, after calling all of ours
14       liars, who said he can't say yes to '96.  He
15       does say yes to 2001.  That's three doctors.  If
16       you believe that testimony you vote no.  Well,
17       the plaintiff's lawyers, they either talked to
18       him or they asked him questions on the stand,
19       they got him to say other things, but their own
20       doctors don't agree with their theory.  That's
21       Dr. Mudad.
22           Dr. Fields, another doctor they didn't
23       bring, did the CT.  Did he say that he found
24       recurrent cancer in the larynx?  No.  He said
25       it's in the pyriform fossa, the pyriform sinus,

1       the same area that Dr. Mudad -- where's
2       Dr. Fields?  Why didn't Dr. Fields testify?  We
3       know why, because he didn't think it was a
4       larynx cancer.  That's another doctor we can put
5       on this list that treated Mary Cooper.  They
6       haven't met their burden of proof.  The plain
7       truth is her doctors disagree with each other,
8       just like Dr. Shapiro said, some of her doctors
9       think it was 2001, some think 1996.  But even
10       the doctors they bring said it manifested,
11       Dr. Weed, yes in 2001; Dr. Mudad, didn't
12       manifest till 2001.
13           Look at the doctors who still believe that
14       she had an unknown primary, Sundararaman,
15       Dr. Ciccia, that's two more doctors that don't
16       back their theory, even in 2010.  They're not
17       saying, oh, it must have been a larynx cancer.
18       Why didn't they testify?  I mean, why do you
19       think they didn't come in and testify?  They
20       don't back the story that the plaintiff's
21       lawyers have been --
22           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
23       Calls for speculation.
24           MR. BELASIC:  They don't back the theory of
25       the case.

1           I'm sorry, Your Honor.
2           THE COURT:  Overruled.
3           MR. BELASIC:  Now, one thing that's
4       undisputed is that what the plaintiffs are
5       asking you to believe is something that their
6       own doctors have literally, and I mean
7       literally, never seen in their entire
8       professional lives.
9           Dr. Shapiro, have you ever seen a larynx
10       cancer that was invisible, microscopic in 1996
11       and somehow was advanced enough to cause a lump
12       on the neck but then remained undetected for
13       five years until 2001?  He says, I've never seen
14       anything like it, anything like it in 21 years.
15           Dr. Weed said he had never seen anything
16       like this.  Because what they're saying is,
17       they're contradicting themselves.  They say at
18       the same time that her larynx cancer was there
19       in '96 and it was so advanced it was spreading
20       and making this lump on her neck, but at the
21       same time they're saying it was invisible and so
22       small that no one could detect it.  What?
23       That's unbelievable.
24           If you look at Shapiro, Weed and Fee -- Fee
25       is our guy.  He hasn't seen it in 40 years.

1           Now, I won't talk much about Dr. Bennett
2       except they call him a liar, except he's the
3       only guy that actually looked at the microscopic
4       slides and actually examined her cells.  And he
5       says the same thing as the three pathologists
6       for Ms. Cooper, the ones that the plaintiff's
7       lawyers didn't bring in.  If he's a liar, what
8       does that say about the three doctors that were
9       the pathologists for Ms. Cooper?
10           Dr. Fee is a superstar in the area of --
11       they say he's preposterous and ridiculous.  He's
12       a superstar in the area of throat and
13       laryngectomy studies.  As he said, he belongs to
14       a group called the Collegium.  There's only 20,
15       the top 20 ENTs in the country are selected.
16       He's extremely well-qualified.  He's done more
17       laryngectomies than any of the other witnesses
18       that they brought.  And he said, we know that
19       the polyps she had that were causing the
20       hoarseness, everyone knows that the polyps were
21       on her vocal cords that's why they weren't
22       cancer.  He said that the biopsy was enough to
23       rule it out, just like all of her pathologists
24       said.  And here's what he said that was
25       important.  Based on his experience, this

1       cancer, the larynx cancer, when it ultimately
2       came in 2001, it was high up in the larynx.
3       They call it the glottis.  And supra means
4       above.  So supraglottic is the part of the
5       glottis that's above.  He said, they don't take
6       four years to appear.  He said, it's not
7       realistic.
8           They're claiming a cancer existed in '96
9       that was strong enough and spread far enough to
10       cause tumors on her neck, but at the same time
11       was invisible and hidden and everything but
12       manifest.  He said, that doesn't happen.  This
13       type of cancer cannot take four years to appear.
14       That's why he concludes it's a new cancer, a new
15       cancer in 2001.  And so what do they do:  They
16       make fun of a 71-year-old man for going to a
17       museum, for going to a museum, because he went
18       on a vacation and came to testify.
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
20           MR. BELASIC:  They call him a liar.
21           THE COURT:  Overruled.
22           MR. BELASIC:  They call him preposterous.
23       Mr. Johnstone, that's exactly what he said.
24           He explained, even when you looked at the
25       cancer cells from '97 and 2001, they can't be

1       the same disease process.  Poorly differentiated
2       means the cells are completely broken down, but
3       yet somehow they became moderately
4       differentiated, meaning they improved.  I mean,
5       it just doesn't make sense.  And, again, this is
6       the only expert that's actually giving testimony
7       on these key issues.  They had three
8       pathologists.  Where were they?
9           All right.  Dr. Shapiro says you answer this
10       question no.  Dr. Weed says you answer this
11       question no.  Dr. Mudad says you answer this
12       question no.  I showed you their sworn testimony
13       so no one would claim I'm a tobacco company
14       liar.  You saw their sworn testimony.
15           Now, did Ms. Cooper rely, did she rely on a
16       statement?  We know from her husband, her
17       ex-husband who said he was completely
18       disinterested, that from the very beginning when
19       she was growing up, he met her when she was 16,
20       he said everybody knew it caused cancer, that's
21       what he said.  And there's no one here to
22       dispute it.  That's in the 1960s.
23           There's no evidence that Mary Cooper was
24       waiting for a tobacco company to say something,
25       like they could have given her a better warning.

1       Because when I asked her, you saw the warning
2       you continued to smoke, I asked her, well, did
3       you keep looking at the warning?
4           And she says, why would I?
5           And then I asked her, well, if you weren't
6       looking at the warning it wouldn't really matter
7       what it said.  She agreed.
8           And I said, well, even if it was a
9       personalized warning.  And she said she wasn't
10       sure even if it was a personalized warning.
11           Now, no manufacturer could ever give a
12       warning that had your name on it and said -- and
13       predicted the future, what would happen, but she
14       said that even if she got one of those warnings
15       she didn't know if it would make a difference.
16       I mean, her own attitude was, did you look at
17       the warning?  Why would I?
18           Now, that doesn't mean that she didn't go on
19       and get cancer that we all have sympathy for
20       her.  But it does mean that she made a choice
21       and a choice that was so different than 60
22       million other people made.
23           You're going to hear and see on the verdict
24       form May 5th, '82.  And you're going to be asked
25       whether or not she relied on a statement or an

1       action after 1982.
2           I'd ask you to read what the definition of
3       reliance is.  It doesn't mean I saw something on
4       TV.  It doesn't mean that.  It says
5       specifically.
6           Reliance, they have to prove reliance.  They
7       have to show the plaintiff would not have acted
8       as she did but for the concealment.  Is there
9       any evidence that if she had gotten a different
10       warning she would have quit smoking?
11           And then to prove reliance you have to show
12       that the concealment or omission was a legal
13       cause of her cancer, and look at this, but for
14       the concealment or omission of the fact the
15       cancer would not have occurred.
16           Now, is there any evidence that if a
17       different warning had come out in 1970 or 1980
18       that Ms. Cooper would have quit smoking?  Her
19       husband says she knew it caused lung cancer from
20       the '60s.  Her father, we saw her father died of
21       lung cancer in the '80s.  She saw the warnings.
22       She was warning other people to quit, but she
23       wasn't going to quit herself.
24           There's no evidence -- Dr. Cummings was
25       their chance.  Dr. Cummings could have come in

1       here and said, Mr. Belasic, if you had only --
2       if your company had only said something and put
3       it on the front page of the paper then she would
4       have quit and avoided the cancer, and that
5       didn't happen.
6           MR. MURPHY:  30 minutes, Mark.
7           MR. BELASIC:  All right.
8           One thing you know and you should know,
9       questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the verdict form
10       you're going to be asked, did she rely on a
11       statement and did something RJ Reynolds or the
12       other defendants say cause her to develop
13       cancer?  Did something they omitted cause her?
14       One thing you should know, and this is the
15       judge's instructions, if you vote yes, if you
16       find yes on those issues, then the percentage of
17       responsibility that you find if you reach that
18       for Mary Cooper, that won't apply.  If you vote
19       yes, there won't be any reduction, there won't
20       be any percentage of responsibility of reduction
21       for Ms. Cooper, so not even 5 percent.  You vote
22       yes on reliance and she's not responsible for
23       her behavior at all.
24           We know she ignored every warning that she
25       got, including all of the pack warnings and

1       Dr. Shapiro.  We know her relatives said they
2       wouldn't do anything.  I'm not going to say much
3       about unfiltered.  She never smoked unfiltered.
4       They were acting like she switched from
5       unfiltered to filtered because she thought they
6       were safer.  She never even thought of smoking
7       unfiltered.  Had nothing to do with her smoking.
8       She said she tried it once and didn't like it.
9       She smoked filtered because her father did.
10           Now, if the plaintiffs are going to prove
11       that she relied on something they have to prove
12       she was unaware of the risks.  And when I asked
13       Dr. Cummings, can you prove -- when I asked
14       Dr. Cummings about warnings and information that
15       might have changed it, he told me you gotta
16       connect the dots, just connect the dots, it's
17       out there.
18           Well, these are the dots.  She saw pack
19       warnings for 35 years.  When she was 12 she
20       heard the news.  She knew about cancer sticks.
21       Her first husband said that when she was in
22       school when he met her everyone knew it was
23       dangerous.  She was telling people not to smoke
24       in the '80s.  She saw her father die in the
25       1980s.  She got a personal warning but did

1       nothing.  She saw the '85 pack warnings.  If you
2       connect the dots, that's the evidence.  She
3       didn't rely on a statement.
4           Now, the problem in these cases is that the
5       injury and the sympathy factor is so high that
6       to say someone is responsible for their choices
7       it sounds harsh.  And so what I'm saying that a
8       person is responsible may sound harsh to you.
9       And of course the plaintiff's lawyers are
10       experts at making it sound harsh.  We're
11       horrible because we say that you might honestly
12       have responsibility for using a legal product.
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me, Judge.  I
14       object.  Denigrating the plaintiff and their
15       presentation of the case.
16           THE COURT:  Keep argument to the evidence in
17       the case.  Sustained.
18           MR. BELASIC:  You agreed to put aside your
19       sympathy.  And the nature of her injuries
20       doesn't change the fact about her smoking
21       injuries.  She didn't rely on anything that a
22       tobacco company said or didn't say, because she
23       knew from the '60s and she ignored every
24       warning.  If you vote yes that she relied, she
25       doesn't have any responsibility legally.

1           So vote no, she did not reasonably rely to
2       her detriment on any statement of fact made by
3       defendants on question 3.
4           Question 4, Were any of these omissions
5       after '82?
6           Of course not.  She admitted that by 1982
7       she knew smoking was dangerous, that's why we
8       focused in on cross-examination, '82 when she's
9       warning her daughter she said yes she knew.  Her
10       husband said she knew from the 1960s, that's her
11       ex-husband who said he was completely neutral.
12           And the same on number 5, Did she rely to
13       her detriment on an act?
14           No, because there's no such evidence.
15           And the same on number 6, Was it after 1982?
16           Of course not.  Throughout the 1980s is when
17       she admits she knew it.
18           Now, the issue of comparative fault you may
19       raise.  If your agree with the testimony of
20       their own doctors, you have to find no on the
21       manifestation before '96.
22           But if you reach this stage, think about all
23       the facts.  She started because of the family
24       and her brother.  She saw the warnings.  She saw
25       the Surgeon General.  Her husband said, everyone

1       knew at the time she was buying cigarettes, it
2       was common knowledge.  She ignores the next
3       warning.  She reads these articles and hears the
4       American Cancer Society.  She never tries to
5       quit in those decades.  She's smoking marijuana,
6       inconsistent with her theory that she would
7       never have smoked anything if she knew it was
8       bad or if she wasn't addicted.  She's reading
9       articles on the health risks.  She admits that
10       she knew that smoking was dangerous.  She's
11       warning her daughter.  She's seeing her father
12       die.  She's ignoring the new pack warnings.  And
13       over the course of those 30 or 35 years she
14       spends an hour or two on a few occasions.  And
15       when she gets the most personalized warning,
16       it's not that she didn't quit, ladies and
17       gentlemen, it's that she told her doctor, I'll
18       try.  And then her doctor came into court and
19       said, well, she must have been addicted because
20       she tried.  But she said under oath she didn't
21       even try.  She always knew the warnings were
22       there.
23           So when you get to verdict form 7, who could
24       have made Mary Cooper stop?  Tobacco company
25       executive go to her house, pulled the cigarettes

1       out of her mouth?
2           The only person -- excuse me.
3           The only person that could have made that
4       decision that could have acted on it and could
5       have quit was Mary Cooper.  Doesn't have
6       anything to do with a mirror, like
7       Mr. Schlesinger said.  It has to do with the
8       ability to act and the choices we make.  She's
9       not 5 percent responsible.  She wasn't 5 percent
10       responsible for her choices.  She was the only
11       one who made it, and she made it in the face of
12       the warnings.  And she made it even though the
13       people who loved her and the people who say they
14       were neutral say that she knew these risks from
15       the very beginning.
16           Now, I'm not going to say much about
17       damages.  Mr. Davis is going to talk about the
18       damages, the economic damages.  But remember
19       that Dr. Weed talked about the fact that she did
20       not use a speech prosthesis that was created for
21       her.  And you can see the tone of voice and you
22       can see how he felt about that decision.
23           Look at the medical record from 2002.  It
24       says she is not using her speech prosthesis very
25       consistently.  She's still relying on the

1       electrolarynx.  But look what her doctors found.
2       With encouragement, she's able to vocalize quite
3       well with her speech prosthesis.  She has no
4       specific complaints.  It's just a factor to take
5       into that the speech prosthesis was created that
6       allowed her to speak without the electrolarynx.
7       And her own doctors say that she was able to
8       vocalize quite well.  Dr. Weed testified that
9       she chose not to use it.
10           Now, Mr. Schlesinger said the whole reason
11       for this case is to get to punitive damages
12       where they're going to ask for more money.  They
13       want 22.3 million.  That's what they told you.
14       They're going to ask for more money if you
15       decide to go to another phase of trial where
16       you're going to hear more witnesses.  The only
17       way to get there is if you find by clear and
18       convincing evidence that punitive damages, extra
19       money that will be awarded to Ms. Cooper are
20       warranted.
21           Look what the instruction is.  It has to be
22       based on the same or similar conduct which is
23       shown to have caused plaintiff's laryngeal
24       cancer.  Well, what caused plaintiff's laryngeal
25       cancer was the legal sale of cigarettes and her

1       choice to make [sic] them.  There's no evidence
2       that advertising caused her cancer.  There's no
3       evidence that some statement on television
4       caused her cancer.  There's no evidence that the
5       Flintstones that ran for one year in 1961 before
6       she ever started smoking, that's not what caused
7       her cancer.
8           They make fun of this, but the truth is it
9       shows that way before Ms. Cooper was even born
10       it's sort of common knowledge in Florida that
11       smoking could be addictive.  In fact, they were
12       calling cigarettes coffin nails a century ago.
13       And Reader's Digest, the most popular magazine,
14       was saying that nicotine was the main reason
15       people smoked.
16           The evidence in this case, it's not
17       disputed, that was not a secret.  That wasn't a
18       secret.  And you should weigh that when you
19       decide whether punitive damages are warranted.
20       So all kinds of articles in the 1950s.  This is
21       before she's born, the biggest publication in
22       the country, it's not a secret that smoking can
23       be dangerous.  And you know, I don't even have
24       to show magazines because her brother said in
25       the '50s everyone said, don't smoke; if you

1       don't smoke, don't start.  That's her brother.
2       It's not some paid witness for a tobacco
3       company.
4           You saw everything we showed you from the
5       '50s, everything that Dr. Cummings admitted was
6       out there, the Life Magazine, the coverage of
7       all of this that they said nicotine is the
8       essential ingredient.  They say it's a horrible
9       secret because Claude Teague, because somebody
10       wrote that at RJ Reynolds when it was being
11       published in the popular press.  It wasn't a
12       secret.
13           The tobacco companies turned over all of the
14       constituents and the carcinogens that were
15       listed in the Surgeon General's Report.  The
16       Surgeon General did say that the research they
17       provided was helpful.  The Surgeon General did
18       say at the time that statistics couldn't prove
19       cause and effect.  And it's true that tobacco
20       company spokespeople for the next 10 or 20 years
21       they harped on those statistics and they said
22       statistics can't prove cause and effect.  And as
23       Mr. Davis said, maybe the tobacco companies hung
24       their hats on what is scientifically true, that
25       statistics can't cause -- can't prove that

1       smoking causes disease.  Maybe they hung their
2       hats for too long.  But it didn't matter to Mary
3       Cooper because from the '60s on her husband says
4       she knew smoking could cause cancer, because
5       from the '60s on she said the Surgeon General's
6       Report on lung and larynx cancer was everywhere.
7           MR. MURPHY:  You have 20 more.
8           MR. BELASIC:  All right.
9           I have to say that because Mr. Schlesinger,
10       I don't know if he was complimenting me or
11       making fun of me, but he talked about this 3
12       percent poll.  But here's the deal.  They have
13       the burden to prove that if the tobacco
14       companies said something in the 1950s it was
15       misleading Ms. Cooper.  Does it make sense that
16       people in the United States in the 1950s, they
17       were looking to the tobacco companies for their
18       medical advice?  I'll ask you to think about
19       that.
20           But we don't have to guess because we know
21       they asked people.  Who are you believing?  Who
22       are you looking to?  And even in the '50s people
23       weren't gullible.  They were looking to the
24       American Cancer Society, the American Medical
25       Association, the Department of Health.  Just

1       like today no one goes to McDonalds and asks --
2       really is relying on them for their health
3       advice.  Talk to your doctor.
4           So the idea that there was some huge fraud.
5       If this was a conspiracy, this huge successful
6       conspiracy, then how come smoking rates are at
7       their lowest of all time?  How come 60 million
8       people quit smoking?  How come the Surgeon
9       General said that 30 million people quit in just
10       10 years after that report came out?  Why did
11       Dr. Cummings admit that 13 million people quit
12       in just a few years after the warnings came out?
13       Because people weren't saying, I better find out
14       what the tobacco companies have to say, you
15       know.
16           And so Mr. Schlesinger says, oh, you're
17       admitting you're a liar.  No, I'm showing you
18       the truth, that tobacco company's voice wasn't
19       influential in this debate, and it certainly
20       wasn't for Ms. Cooper.
21           There were some questions about cigarette
22       design.  We know that -- that were raised in
23       this case.  We know that the tobacco companies
24       participated with the government, and
25       Dr. Cummings agreed, in something called the

1       Tobacco Working Group, and we know that the
2       purpose was to create safer cigarettes.  So they
3       were voluntarily working with the government for
4       10 years.  Dr. Cummings said they did all of
5       those studies and all of the research on
6       different cigarettes.
7           Here's an internal memo.  They didn't write
8       this thinking, hey, there will be a lawsuit and
9       we can use it.  This was a secret memo, memo
10       from the president.  Says, cooperate with the
11       government, foster a good relationship with
12       them.  If there's a safer cigarette, let's
13       continue the program.  Let's increase our
14       efforts.  This isn't something saying we want to
15       kill our customers, as Mr. Schlesinger implies.
16       Why would any company want to do that?
17           Now, none of her doctors, the doctors they
18       brought in to say that smoking caused her
19       cancer, none of them said design had anything to
20       do with it.  And Mr. Murphy asked Dr. Shapiro,
21       does your opinion depend on whether it was
22       filtered or unfiltered or menthol or any other
23       cigarette design?  Dr. Shapiro said no, just the
24       fact that she smoked.  It wasn't the design of
25       the cigarette.

1           Dr. Cummings sort of cut to the chase.  All
2       the stuff that Dr. Cummings talked about, he
3       said there's additives, there's ingredients,
4       there's ammonia.  I asked him, they don't put
5       ammonia in menthols, do they?
6           And he said, yeah.  Sort of caught him on
7       that there's no ammonia used in menthols.
8           But bottom line, if you take tobacco and
9       roll it up yourself, make a roll-your-own
10       cigarette, that's not going to have a filter.
11       It's just tobacco rolled in paper, right?
12       According to the plaintiff's theory, that must
13       be safer than the horrible factory-made
14       cigarettes.  So we asked Dr. Cummings, which is
15       safer?  Which is more dangerous?
16           And Dr. Cummings says that roll-your-owns
17       are more dangerous versus the factory-made
18       cigarettes.
19           I asked him, which one is more addictive?
20           And he wasn't making it up because he said
21       he had done two studies on this.
22       Roll-your-owns, roll-your-owns, just roll up the
23       tobacco in a paper is more addictive.
24           And then the biggest question in his own
25       article he had written that roll-your-owns had a

1       higher risk of lung cancer than factory
2       cigarettes.  And so I asked him, and he said
3       that's true.
4           So there isn't a shred of evidence that
5       something in a cigarette made Ms. Cooper unable
6       to quit when 60 million other people were.  But
7       just cut to the bottom line.  Forget all the
8       ingredients or whatever engineering
9       Mr. Schlesinger wants to talk about, you roll up
10       tobacco in a cigarette and, according to
11       Dr. Cummings, it's the factory-made cigarettes,
12       the Winstons and Kools that are less dangerous
13       and the roll-your-owns that have higher rates of
14       cancer.
15           There's no evidence linking any of that
16       obviously, though, to Ms. Cooper.
17           They talked about increasing addiction.
18       Dr. Cummings admitted we don't have an
19       increasing level of addiction in the country
20       today.  It's not going up.  If anything, it's
21       going down.  This is Dr. Cummings' own report.
22       It talked about filters and cheating a machine.
23       One of the things we pointed out is the reason
24       that the scientific community thought filters
25       were safer wasn't because of a machine; it's

1       because they looked at the death rates, they
2       looked at the people who smoked filters and
3       compared them to the people that smoked either
4       unfiltered, they compared higher tar to lower
5       tar, so they looked at the actual death rates of
6       real people, not some experiment, and they
7       consistently found that there were lower death
8       rates, consistently found this.  That's the '79
9       Surgeon General's Report.
10           '81, filter tip lower tar cigarettes produce
11       lower rates of lung cancer.
12           '89, smoking filters reduces the risk of
13       lung cancer.
14           This has nothing to do with a cigarette
15       machine, ladies and gentlemen.  This is Surgeon
16       General looking at the cancer rates.  People who
17       smoked filters got lower rates of cancer.  Now,
18       30 years later, they say, well, there was
19       something wrong with the statistics or something
20       wrong with the way we measure it.  That's not
21       proof of fraud, and it's certainly not proof
22       that Ms. Cooper is entitled to punitive damages
23       and to get even more money.
24           Why don't you take the nicotine out?  Well,
25       it's legal to sell cigarettes with nicotine.

1       The government has never asked to take it out.
2       The FDA regulates nicotine levels.  The FDA
3       hasn't ordered any of the companies to reduce
4       nicotine.
5           But look what happened.  Plaintiffs say you
6       should decrease the nicotine or remove it.  But
7       you saw, when I was talking to Dr. Cummings, in
8       the 1970s that Tobacco Working Group where the
9       companies worked with the government, all the
10       research was on increasing nicotine.  They
11       figured if you increased nicotine people would
12       smoke less cigarettes and get less tar and it
13       might be safer.  And he admitted that's what the
14       government was telling the companies.  They told
15       them to research that.
16           And Mr. Davis asked Dr. Cummings, isn't it
17       true that as recently as 2000, 2000, when Mary
18       Cooper was at the end of her smoking, isn't it
19       true that as recently as 2000 you said you
20       weren't sure whether it would be safer to
21       increase or decrease nicotine in light
22       cigarettes?  Even Dr. Cummings thought that.
23           And when Philip Morris, we heard they took
24       nicotine out, they denicotinized their
25       cigarettes.  So did everyone say, fantastic,

1       that's a great job, it's a safer cigarette?  No,
2       they attacked them.  They said, oh, it's not
3       safer, addicted smokers might inhale the same
4       amount, they might smoke more.  That's the
5       government.  That's a meeting that wasn't
6       produced until -- that's a meeting that was
7       produced in litigation.
8           So the government is saying increase
9       nicotine in the '70s and '80s, maybe we can make
10       light cigarettes safer, people won't smoke as
11       much.  Plaintiffs are saying take it out.
12       Philip Morris takes out the nicotine, the
13       government says, no, that's even more dangerous.
14       There's a phrase called, damned if you do and
15       damned if you don't.  And the plaintiffs play
16       both sides of the fence and they attack the
17       companies for whatever they do, because the real
18       argument, ladies and gentlemen, here is the
19       company should go out of business.  Judge Tuter
20       said that's not something you can find.  The
21       very first instruction I showed you, it's legal
22       to sell cigarettes even though they cause cancer
23       and are addictive.  And Judge Tuter's
24       instruction says you can't hold the companies
25       liable just for selling and just for

1       advertising.  And that's what they want them to
2       do.
3           So on question 11 you should find no.
4       Punitive damages, damages above the level of
5       compensation are not warranted in this case, not
6       for any of these things.
7           When Ms. Cooper's own family members say
8       that they grew up in an era where people were
9       told not to smoke and they say that by the '60s
10       when she was buying cigarettes everyone knew it
11       caused cancer, that's a fact that can't be
12       denied.  Those are the eyewitnesses who were on
13       the ground.  And there's no evidence to dispute
14       it.  The only evidence to dispute it comes from
15       a woman who is suing for 22 million dollars.
16       And you'll weigh that credibility.  But her
17       brother Gary and former husband Charles, they
18       don't have a dog in this fight and that's what
19       they say.
20           Now, she said the news was everywhere on the
21       Surgeon General's Report.  She said I heard it
22       and I've seen it.  And here's what that news
23       was.
24 25 5500
1           VOICE:  This is a CBS News Extra on Smoking
2       and Health:  The findings of the Surgeon
3       General's Committee.
4           VOICE:  Almost from the moment that
5       cigarettes were introduced they were attacked,
6       but the attacks took a new turn 10 years ago and
7       culminated in today's report by the Surgeon
8       General's Committee.
9           This, in summary, is what the committee
10       says:
11           Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung
12       cancer in men and data on women smokers points
13       the same way.
14           Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of
15       cancer of the larynx and probably the most
16       important cause of chronic bronchitis.
17           Cigarette smoking may be related to other
18       lung diseases.
19           Male smokers have a much higher death rate
20       from heart disease, although it's not proven
21       that smoking is the cause.
22           On the question of filters the committee
23       says there is no evidence that they do any good,
24       but it didn't exclude the possibility that an
25       effective filter might be developed.

1           In short, the committee says, if you smoke
2       cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying
3       early.  The sooner you start, the more you
4       smoke, the more you inhale, the worse your
5       chances are.
6           It's like being told that an old friend has
7       all along been betraying you.  In a case like
8       that, you give the old friend every possible
9       chance before you finally decide to believe what
10       you have been told, and maybe even then you give
11       him a chance to reform.
12           In this kind of a country it comes down to
13       you, whether you like it or not.  No one is
14       going to forbid an adult to smoke and it is now
15       quite clear that no one is going to tell him
16       it's good for him either.  The decision is his,
17       the decision and the health that may depend on
18       it.
19           This is Harry Reasoner.  Good night.
20           VOICE:  This has been a CBS News Extra on
21       Smoking and Health.
22           (Video clip concluded.)
23           MR. BELASIC:  Harry Reasoner there sounded a
24       lot like her older brother Gary Cooper when Gary
25       Cooper, seven years older, grew up in the '50s

1       said, no one said it was good for you.  The
2       attitude that everyone was saying, if you don't
3       start, don't smoke, don't smoke, don't start
4       [sic].
5           And that's the kind of news coverage that
6       Ms. Cooper said she saw.
7           So 40 years later here's Dr. Koop, he's the
8       Surgeon General who released the addiction
9       report, and he says what our own common sense
10       tells us, that the choice to light up is always
11       yours.  We know that when he left the Surgeon
12       General's office he started his health company,
13       Dr. Koop.  The choice to light up is always
14       yours.  Ultimately you are the one that has
15       control over your behavior.  The cigarette -- it
16       won't light itself.  It won't jump into your
17       mouth.
18           And we know that's true for Ms. Cooper.  We
19       know that she pushed aside cigarettes for an
20       hour and a half and then she resumed smoking.
21       And now her lawyers are saying that that is
22       proof that it was impossible to quit and because
23       of her injuries she should get 22 million
24       dollars.
25           There wasn't any time when Ms. Cooper was

1       regularly smoking that she didn't know that it
2       was bad for her health.  That's what her husband
3       Charles Bray says from the '60s when he first
4       met her in high school, and that's what she
5       says, it's been there since I can almost
6       remember smoking.  There isn't a single
7       cigarette that she ever paid money for that
8       didn't have the exact warning that the United
9       States government mandated.  The companies
10       complied with that law and society determined it
11       was legal to sell.  It was always there.  And
12       she said, it was on every pack, but I didn't pay
13       any attention to that.
14           Now her lawyers are saying that if you had
15       given some information that she relied on a
16       statement, she says right there she didn't pay
17       any attention.  She challenged me, why would I
18       look at a warning?  She's perfectly free, like
19       all of us, to make any choice she wants or to
20       take any risk she wants.  But what she said is
21       she wouldn't pay attention to warnings, and
22       that's why there's no question that when you
23       come to, did she rely, would she have stopped
24       smoking if RJ Reynolds or someone had said
25       something, she's telling us in her own words she

1       wouldn't.  That's why her fiancé Robert Aaron
2       said, you can't tell her anything, she'd run you
3       off.  That's why her daughter Mechelle didn't
4       come to testify.  We heard, Dr. Cummings did, I
5       can't encourage my mom to do anything.  She's
6       her own person.  And she's the only person that
7       could decide to quit.  And she was the only
8       person that could quit.  No one could do it for
9       her.
10           And we know in the end that when she got the
11       most personalized warning it wasn't the fact
12       that she didn't stop, I mean, it's that
13       Dr. Shapiro didn't know the truth.  He assumed
14       that she had tried over and over again and he
15       said that's why she's addicted.  But we know
16       that when the most personalized warning came,
17       she would tell her doctor, I'll try, but she
18       didn't even try.
19           There's been a lot of passionate arguments
20       made this morning by very skilled lawyers for
21       the plaintiffs, and one of the things that makes
22       these cases tough is those passions.  And I'm
23       asking you to remember your promise to put aside
24       your sympathy and decide the case on the
25       evidence you've seen and give all the evidence

1       that they've shown fair weight, but to decide it
2       only on the evidence.  Because in the end it
3       comes down to Ms. Cooper and the choices she
4       made, unlike all of the other people who quit,
5       unlike her brother who decided not to start,
6       unlike her first husband who quit, it comes down
7       to that.
8           Now, I know you didn't expect to be here for
9       three weeks.  You certainly didn't expect to
10       come in and be on this jury.  And it is a
11       serious case, but I hope you've at least enjoyed
12       parts of it, an hour of it, ten minutes of it.
13       If you enjoyed part of it, that's great, but I
14       thank you for every single minute that you've
15       spent on this.  I thank you for your promise to
16       put aside your passions and sympathies and I
17       thank you for your promise to decide this case
18       only on the evidence.  Thank you kindly.


8           MR. DAVIS:  May it please the Court?
9           Ms. Cooper.
10           Counsel.
11           Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
12           I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to
13       speak directly to you again after the last time
14       was when we were hear for opening statement.  It
15       was very nice.
16           I want to join everyone in the courtroom by
17       thanking you for your service.  Your attention
18       to the evidence has been very impressive.  We
19       have all appreciated it so much.  And I thank
20       you very much.
21           Mr. Belasic covered very important points,
22       all of which apply to Philip Morris and the
23       other companies.  I join him in his remarks.  I
24       adopt those remarks.  I encourage you to think
25       about them in the context of all the companies

1       in the case.  I will not try to -- I will try
2       not to repeat his points in making my
3       presentation to you.
4           Now, I did want to talk just very briefly
5       about your verdict form.
6           Now, I think he explained extremely well
7       that if you answer no to question one the case
8       is over, we can go home, and why you should, and
9       also in question two about the medical case and
10       why you should answer no there.  And if you get
11       to that question and answer no, we can go home.
12           There is one aspect of question one that I
13       do want to discuss with you, and that is this
14       notion of legal cause.  Now, we talked about
15       that just a little bit in opening statement, and
16       you remember I gave you the example of walking
17       across the street and getting hit by a truck.
18       And if I got hit by a truck the medical cause of
19       my injuries would be hit by a truck.  And if I
20       came to court to seek damages for the injuries
21       then I would have to prove more than the fact
22       that the truck was the medical cause of my
23       injuries.  I would have to prove that it is the
24       legal cause of my injuries.
25           And you have in your instructions, starting

1       with this very first question, the definition of
2       legal cause.  And you will see that definition
3       in the legal instructions you have over and over
4       again as you go through the law applicable to
5       all these claims.  But I want to focus on it
6       right here.
7           Was she addicted?  If she was, was that
8       addiction a legal cause of her laryngeal cancer?
9       Now, in your instructions the first time you'll
10       see it is on page 4 of the instructions.  I'm
11       going to put it up here.  "An addiction to
12       smoking cigarettes containing nicotine is a
13       legal cause of laryngeal cancer if it directly
14       and in natural and continuous sequence produces
15       or contributes substantially to producing
16       laryngeal cancer so that it can reasonably be
17       said but for the addiction to cigarettes
18       containing nicotine such laryngeal cancer would
19       not have occurred."
20           Now, we ask a lot of you folks, we throw a
21       lot of evidence at you and then right at the end
22       we're asking you to look at legal terms.  But we
23       talked about the direct and continuous -- where
24       my pencil went.
25           We throw a lot of legal terms at you, but

1       what I want you to focus on as well -- and we
2       talked about direct -- natural, continuous and
3       direct.  I want you to think about this but for
4       language.  And you'll see that in the definition
5       of legal cause that is applicable to this, to
6       the reliance claims, all the other claims
7       contain but for.  And what that means is, if it
8       weren't there, she would not have gotten
9       laryngeal cancer.  But for the addiction she
10       would not have gotten laryngeal cancer.
11           Now, there can certainly be more than one
12       legal cause.  That's the next instruction.  But
13       every legal cause has to be a but for cause.  If
14       you take it away it wouldn't have happened.
15       That's the law.
16           And that's what we mean by the difference
17       between medical causation and legal causation.
18       That's what the law of this case is.
19           So in this case what it means as to this
20       question number two -- I'm sorry, number one,
21       that was she addicted, and if you decide she was
22       not, and Mr. Belasic presented our evidence on
23       that, you would put no.  But if you say, yeah,
24       well, maybe she's addicted, but then was the
25       addiction a legal cause of her laryngeal cancer?

1       In other words, but for, had it not been for the
2       addiction would she have not gotten it?
3           And you heard his presentation on her
4       decisions and her choices and her awareness and
5       I won't repeat it.  But that's the legal
6       structure that we're under.
7           Now, I do want to focus on Philip Morris
8       because we all have different stories in the
9       case.  Philip Morris is in this case, as you
10       know, because Ms. Cooper smoked Marlboro
11       menthols.
12           She did make passing reference to two other
13       Philip Morris brands, Virginia Slims, Benson &
14       Hedges.  She couldn't be very specific about it.
15       She said she tried them at some point in the
16       '80s.  But you also remember from her
17       examination that pretrial she said she wanted to
18       clear up any confusion about the brands that she
19       smoked and so she created this chart that could
20       be brought to court to show you what brands she
21       smoked.  And you'll notice that Marlboro, which
22       is the only Philip Morris product, appears in
23       1990 and goes to the time that she quit.  There
24       is no mention of Virginia Slims or Benson &
25       Hedges there.  So it wasn't important enough

1       when she was trying to be careful to get the --
2       and clarify any confusion about what she smoked
3       to put it down.
4           So realistically Marlboro menthols and
5       Marlboro menthol lights are the only two
6       Philip Morris products that are at issue in this
7       case.
8           Now, you know that she switched from Kool to
9       the Marlboro menthols in 1990.  You know the
10       story that it was when her sister -- I mean, her
11       daughter -- I'm sorry, I was thinking about the
12       lights, I apologize.
13           She testified she did not know why she
14       switched to the regulars in 1990.  Remember she
15       said she did not know.  Now, think about that
16       for a minute, that she could not say why she
17       switched from Kools to the regular menthols in
18       1990.  In the context of all this evidence that
19       you've seen, think about all the ads you have
20       seen.  She testified very clearly that no ad
21       influenced her brand choice, not a one.
22           Think about all the evidence of the
23       statements made by tobacco companies, the secret
24       documents, et cetera, et cetera.  No company
25       statement had anything to do with her selecting

1       that brand, just as it had nothing to do with
2       her selection of any brand of cigarette ever in
3       her smoking career.
4           Now, what did the evidence show?  What was
5       the snapshot of Ms. Cooper in 1990?  Well, we
6       know in 1990 there had not been an ad on
7       television or on the radio for any cigarette for
8       19 years.  In 1990, for that same 19 years,
9       every print ad had the same warning that was on
10       the pack.  And every pack of Marlboro menthols
11       she purchased, starting in 1990, had had that
12       rotating warning, the four rotating warnings for
13       five years.
14           Now, at that point in her life, 1990,
15       Ms. Cooper was 39 years old.  She had been
16       smoking for over 20 years.  Her daughter
17       Mechelle was 20 years old and lived with her.
18       Her granddaughters Concetta and Mary were 4 and
19       3 and lived with her.  Mechelle was pregnant
20       with Jonathan, who would come along, the third
21       grandchild, that would come along the next year.
22       Bob Aaron had been in her life for about five
23       years living with her and Mechelle and the
24       grandchildren.  They called him grandfather.
25       She was finishing up her twelfth year of

1       managing the Take One Lounge.  She was managing
2       the club.  She was being a mother figure to the
3       dancers.  She ordered supplies.  She did the
4       payroll, the hiring and the firing.  She kept
5       the place running.  She was the grown up in
6       charge.  And she did a great job.
7           At that point in her life when she switched
8       to Marlboro menthols at the age of 39,
9       Ms. Cooper was a mature, hard-working, savvy
10       woman who made her own decisions and ran her own
11       life.  Whatever the reason she switched, and we
12       don't know -- we know it wasn't significant
13       enough for her to remember.  We know for sure it
14       wasn't anything that a tobacco company said or
15       didn't say.
16           Now, in 1995 she switched to Marlboro
17       menthol lights, the light cigarettes.  And
18       that's the story that you heard about her
19       daughter, who would buy cigarettes for her, went
20       to the store.  They were out of the brand.  She
21       brought home the light cigarettes.  And she went
22       back and forth between lights and regulars for a
23       while and then settled on the lights.  And that
24       was the last brand that she smoked until she
25       quit.

1           But again, just like the decision in 2000
2       and every other decision about which brands to
3       smoke before that, nothing that Philip Morris or
4       any tobacco company said or didn't say had
5       anything to do with that choice of brand.  No
6       advertisement had anything to do with that
7       choice of brand.
8           Now, she did say that the word "lights" on
9       the package made her think they were better for
10       her just as the word "lights" on everything she
11       saw made her think that it was safer.  But she
12       also said that she had throughout her entire
13       smoking career, which was over 25 years at that
14       time, that she had seen the word "lights" on
15       packages from the time that lights started
16       coming out in the '70s and that she had always
17       thought maybe in her mind that they thought they
18       were safer from that very word.  But she said
19       she was not looking for a safer cigarette.  And
20       she wasn't looking for a safer cigarette at the
21       time that she started smoking these lights.
22           Remember she told us that when Mechelle
23       brought the package home that was the first time
24       she'd ever thought about switching to lights.
25       It was the first time she even knew Marlboro

1       menthol came in lights.  So if the store had not
2       been out of her main brand we wouldn't be
3       talking about lights at all.
4           And we have had a lot of evidence in this
5       case about lights.  I mean, you would think it
6       was a central issue.  But the reality is, and
7       you heard this from Dr. Cummings when we did the
8       math, lights -- the Marlboro Lights were the
9       only light cigarettes she ever smoked in her
10       entire life.  The most she could have smoked
11       them was for less than two and perhaps as little
12       as less than one year before she says, before
13       she says her cancer manifested, that November 21
14       date, 1996.
15           So, now, don't get us wrong, I mean, you
16       heard Mr. Belasic's presentation on the
17       medicine.  Dr. Fee, Dr. Bennett, all of her
18       treating physicians, we do not believe that she
19       can carry her burden of proof by showing that
20       that disease manifested by November 21, 1996.
21       But if that's what it was, the only -- she
22       smoked Marlboro products for only six years,
23       less than six really.  And she only smoked light
24       cigarettes for at most less than two.
25           Dr. Mudad and Dr. Shapiro both told you that

1       it takes 10 pack years, 10 years of one pack per
2       day, before you reach a threshold where
3       cigarettes can contribute to disease.  So if you
4       were to find that that disease manifested, and I
5       don't think you will get there, but if you were,
6       then you have to consider that the medical
7       evidence is that the Philip Morris product could
8       not have contributed, and certainly not the
9       lights.  Because under six years, even if she
10       was smoking a pack and a half a day, you're not
11       going to get to 10, and that's giving her the
12       most she ever said she smoked, one to one and a
13       half.  And the lights didn't have anything to do
14       with it medically.
15           All right.  Now, I do want to spend just a
16       little bit of time, and Mr. Belasic said I would
17       spend just a little time on economic damages.
18       I'm not going to spend a lot, but I do want to
19       point out just a couple of things.
20           You remember --
21           MS. BRAY:  Ten minutes.
22           MR. DAVIS:  Ten minutes?  Boy.
23           Last Tuesday Mr. Padron said these were her
24       past medical costs as of Monday the 28th -- as
25       of March 28th, 1,123,272.  On Monday Ms. Cooper

1       said, I went through the bills, she brought them
2       in and she said I've added them up and brought
3       them up to today, it was 1,486,543.  So between
4       March 28 and today there's a difference of
5       $363,000.
6           We went through them.  I will leave them
7       here in case something to say about this.  There
8       are four bills in that stack that postdate March
9       28th for a total of $10,409.
10           We also went through them to look for
11       duplicates.  Every one of these tabs is a bill
12       that's in more than once.  We didn't put a tab
13       on the first time it was there, but every time
14       it appeared as a duplicate we put a tab on it.
15       30 percent roughly.
16           Now, it's not your job to go through these
17       medical bills.  It's not -- it's their job to
18       prove it.  And we're not saying she didn't have
19       medical damages, but there is a casualness to
20       these numbers.  They just get thrown around.
21       They have an obligation to prove to you what her
22       medical bills in the past were.
23           Now, as far as her future medicals, you
24       heard Ms. McKenzie and looked at -- that was
25       Ms. McKenzie, right, and she had all those

1       medicines that she would need and physical
2       therapy that she would need.  Well, Ms. Cooper
3       isn't even going to physical therapy, and that
4       was a huge number.  She has no plans to go to
5       physical therapy.
6           Of her medications, four of her medications
7       have nothing to do with the injuries that she's
8       suing for.  They have to do with sleep and blood
9       pressure and shingles and pain.  So I just
10       suggest to you that it's -- and I'm not
11       suggesting you go through this.  It's not your
12       job.  But just be aware of the absence of proof
13       on that point.
14           Okay.  I want to talk very briefly about the
15       concealment claim, if I could.  These questions,
16       and Mr. Belasic covered this.  And, again, I
17       want you to focus with me if you would on these
18       questions.  Did Mary Cooper reasonably rely to
19       her detriment on any statement of material fact
20       made by the defendants that concealed or omitted
21       material information concerning the health
22       effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature,
23       and, if so, was that reliance a legal cause of
24       her injuries?
25           There's that term again, and you'll see it

1       on the conspiracy claim, you'll see it all
2       through here, the requirement of legal cause.
3           Well, where is the evidence of a statement
4       that she relied on that is a legal cause of her
5       laryngeal cancer?  Because that's what it has to
6       be.  Where is the evidence that she came forward
7       and said, you know what, one of you folks, one
8       of your companies said this and I relied on it
9       and I reasonably relied on it and if you hadn't
10       said it I would have quit and I never would have
11       gotten laryngeal cancer.  That's her burden of
12       proof on these reliance claims, the concealment
13       claim.  That's the law.
14           And I think there was a suggestion that we
15       put a jury instruction up here and it was just a
16       bunch of blah, blah, blah.  It's not blah, blah,
17       blah.  This is a courtroom.  This is a place
18       where people prove claims.  And if they don't
19       prove their claims it's not that they get thrown
20       out of court.  That's not what this is about.
21       It's about the right of a citizen to come in and
22       bring four corporations to court and three weeks
23       of everybody's time and say, look, I have a
24       chance to prove my claim.  We should all be
25       proud of that.  But you have to prove it.  And

1       if you don't prove your claim you don't get
2       money.  That's not getting thrown out of court.
3       That's just not proving your claim under the
4       law, not the blah, blah, blah, the law.
5           All right.  I want to talk very briefly --
6           How am I doing?
7           MS. BRAY:  Five minutes.
8           MR. DAVIS:  Five minutes, okay.
9           I've got 5 minutes and I'm going to yield
10       the floor to my colleagues.
11           But I do want to point out something.  You
12       know if you answer question one no, we're done,
13       we go home.  Question two no, we go home.  But
14       there's something else.  You get to these
15       questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 on fraud and
16       concealment, if you say no to all of those, you
17       don't get to punitive damages.  It's almost like
18       the argument was, well, of course you're going
19       to consider how much to punish the companies, of
20       course you are.  No.  If you say no that she did
21       not point to a statement or an omission about
22       health effects or the addictive nature of
23       cigarettes that she relied on reasonably such
24       that it could reasonably be said that but for
25       that she wouldn't have gotten sick, you don't

1       get to punitive damages.
2           Now, if we do get to punitive damages we
3       have a separate proceeding.  We come back, more
4       evidence.  We have more witnesses, that's fine,
5       more argument, more instruction.  But I want you
6       to focus with me very briefly on that part of
7       the instructions that deals with punitive
8       damages.
9           This is on page 13, and you'll have these.
10       The burden is on the plaintiff to prove by clear
11       and convincing evidence that punitive damages is
12       warranted.  This is different than greater
13       weight.  Clear and convincing evidence is
14       evidence that is precise, explicit, lacking in
15       confusion and of such weight that it produces a
16       firm belief or conviction without hesitation
17       about the matter in issue.
18           And what is it that she has to prove to show
19       she's entitled to more money beyond what would
20       compensate her for this?  She has to prove that
21       defendants were guilty of intentional misconduct
22       which was a substantial cause of her laryngeal
23       cancer.  Now, folks, those words are important.
24       They're not blah, blah, blah.  That's the law.
25       She cannot recover punitive damages because of

1       harm to anyone other than her, because this is
2       her case.  It has to be a substantial --
3       intentional misconduct that was a substantial
4       cause of her laryngeal cancer.  That's what the
5       law is.  Intentional misconduct means that
6       defendant had actual knowledge of the conduct
7       and that there was a high probability of injury
8       to her.  And you cannot seek to punish a
9       defendant for any harm suffered by individuals
10       other than plaintiff.  And the reason I -- if
11       you hear a little catch in my voice here, this
12       is what I want to say to you, Mr. Schlesinger I
13       don't think was here when we did jury selection.
14       But I stood in front of you and all those other
15       people, and so did my colleagues over here, and
16       we said, hey, folks, we represent tobacco
17       companies.  Tobacco companies make a dangerous,
18       adult product that causes serious health
19       problems and they do it to make money.  I asked
20       that.  We said -- and you know what, a lot of
21       people said, I can't sit and be fair.  I'm not
22       going to give you a fair shake.  They were
23       honest about it.  Our system works because
24       ordinary citizens can come in and bring big
25       companies to bar and try to prove their claim.

1       I'm proud of that.  We all should be.  But it
2       works because we have fair and impartial people.
3           When you -- if what you're hearing is you
4       should be mad at the tobacco companies, you
5       should be mad, look at all that stuff they did,
6       and that's the basis of your decision, I'd ask
7       you to hear that for exactly what it is.  And
8       that is, that is simply don't follow what you
9       said you would do.
10           Now, there is a reason you seven are here,
11       as opposed to the other 300, because you took an
12       oath and said, I can do it, and I believe you
13       and I trust you to not just get mad.  Because
14       that's not what this is about in this room.
15       It's about the law and the evidence.  It's also
16       about this:  Everybody on this side of courtroom
17       respects Ms. Cooper.  We know we respect her,
18       you know we respect her right to come in and
19       prove her case.  The decisions that she made and
20       the freedoms that she made as a strong,
21       independent-minded, self-directed, smart,
22       intelligent, successful woman are part of the
23       freedoms that all of us enjoy.  But the flip
24       side of freedom is that you do have to take
25       responsibility.

1           I appreciate the time.  I'm going to turn it
2       over to my colleagues.


6           MS. LUTHER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  How
7       are you all holding up?
8           May it please the Court?
9           Counsel.
10           Ms. Cooper.
11           Again, my name is Kelly Luther, and as
12       Mr. Schlesinger referred to it, I represent
13       little Liggett.  Mr. Schlesinger also conceded
14       that Liggett shouldn't get a big percentage of
15       the fault in this case because Ms. Cooper didn't
16       smoke many of their cigarettes.  Well, you've
17       sat through this trial and you know that the
18       evidence is undisputed that she didn't smoke any
19       of Liggett's products.  She wasn't injured in
20       any way by a Liggett product.  She didn't become
21       addicted to cigarettes because of a Liggett
22       product and she didn't get her laryngeal cancer
23       from a Liggett product.  She didn't even know
24       the name Liggett Group, Inc.
25           Now, I was here with you for the past three

1       weeks because plaintiff claims that Liggett
2       entered into an agreement, a conspiracy with
3       co-defendants to conceal information regarding
4       the health effects of smoking and as a result
5       she developed her laryngeal cancer.
6           Now, remember, you've heard this before, she
7       has the burden of proof with regard to each
8       defendant separately.  So with that as a
9       framework, what did the evidence show with
10       regard to Liggett?
11           It demonstrates that Liggett didn't conspire
12       to conceal information regarding the health
13       effects of cigarette smoking.
14           Now, beginning --
15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I object, Judge.  The
16       findings are preclusive.  You cannot --
17           THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.  She's
18       commenting on the evidence.  You can address
19       that in your rebuttal, sir, if you wish.
20       Overruled.
21           MS. LUTHER:  So beginning in the 1950s
22       scientific evidence was surfacing concerning the
23       risks of cigarette smoke.  These early
24       scientific studies were very important.  You saw
25       the Life Magazine spread with the mouse

1       skin-painting studies.
2           So what did Liggett do in response to this
3       emerging information?  It didn't attend the
4       Plaza Hotel meeting.  It didn't join the TIRC.
5       And it didn't participate in The Frank
6       Statement; instead it took an independent path.
7           You may remember Plaintiff's Exhibit 3289,
8       it's a document that Dr. Cummings talked about.
9       It's a document written by British scientists
10       who visited the United States in 1958.
11           Tammy, if you could pull up the first slide.
12           They reported in this document at page 5
13       that Liggett felt that the problem was
14       sufficiently serious to justify large scale
15       investment by the company directly in
16       experimental research on smoking cancer.
17           And then they go on to say, we were told
18       that Liggett had already invested considerably
19       more in this work than the combined donations of
20       the rest of the industry to TIRC.
21           That's all for that one.  Thank you.
22           Now, Liggett invested enormous resources in
23       a biological testing program hiring Arthur D.
24       Little to try and reproduce the results that
25       Dr. Wynder came up with in his mouse

1       skin-painting studies and to see if they could
2       identify what in cigarette smoke was causing the
3       problems.  You may remember the huge stack of
4       paper that I had with me when I cross-examined
5       Dr. Cummings that scared you all and made you
6       think I was going to take a long time with him.
7       That's Liggett's nine-volume submission to the
8       Surgeon General's committee.  This binder here
9       are all of Liggett's exhibits that have been
10       introduced into evidence.  So you'll be able to
11       take them back to the jury room with you and
12       you'll be able to go through them.  I'm limited
13       for time so I'm not going to spend as much time
14       as I would like talking with you about them.
15           You know, Liggett was acknowledged and
16       thanked repeatedly for the information it
17       provided in this submission.  Now,
18       Mr. Schlesinger claims that the top scientists
19       that were appointed by President Kennedy to this
20       advisory commission were somehow conned by
21       Liggett, that, yeah, they thanked them, but they
22       didn't know that they were being lied to,
23       essentially.
24           Well, examples showing how appreciative the
25       public health officials were are found in the

1       submission.  They're found in Liggett Exhibit
2       2398, 219, 6965, along with a few others that
3       are in this binder that I didn't talk to
4       Dr. Cummings about but they're still in
5       evidence.
6           Now, I went through the documents with you
7       with Dr. Cummings.  You probably remember what
8       they say.  Mr. Schlesinger belittles them.  I'll
9       leave it to you to judge the value of those
10       thanks that Liggett received for the work that
11       it did.
12           Now, Mr. Schlesinger also showed you a
13       document that Dr. Cummings talked about in his
14       closing, that's the 1961 Arthur D. Little
15       document called L&M, A Perspective Review.  And
16       you'll remember they pulled out the first
17       paragraph of this document.  And Dr. Cummings
18       told you that Liggett didn't share with the
19       Surgeon General the conclusions contained in
20       that document.  It said there are biologically
21       active materials present in cigarette tobacco
22       that are cancer-causing, cancer-promoting,
23       poisonous and stimulating pleasurable and
24       flavorful.
25           In fact, Liggett did tell the Surgeon

1       General's committee all of those things.  Just
2       to give you a flavor of what's in the submission
3       let's look at a few excerpts.
4           Tammy, if I could see -- it's going to be a
5       little further on.  If you can just scroll
6       through them and I'll tell you where to stop.
7           Okay.  Go back one, go back two, perfect.
8           So here in volume one of the submission at
9       page 3, "Liggett researchers concluded that
10       there was an association between cigarette
11       smoking and overall death rates."
12           And they go on to tell the committee that
13       this effect increases with the amount smoked and
14       very probably with the years smoked.  That's
15       what we're telling the Surgeon General's
16       committee when we turn this over to them in
17       April of 1963.
18           The next document Liggett told the Surgeon
19       General's committee what it found in regard to
20       filters.  Liggett never said filters were safe,
21       instead this is Exhibit 2398.  The minutes
22       indicate that Liggett told the Surgeon General's
23       committee that condensate, you heard that term,
24       "the tar from filtered smoke is just as or
25       almost as carcinogenic as that from unfiltered

1       smoke."  That's what we told the Surgeon
2       General's committee.
3           Then the next document, going back to the
4       submission itself, here's the table of contents
5       for volume 3 of the submission.  It lists
6       materials which have been suggested as possible
7       carcinogens for the human lung, and it lists
8       these seven items.  They're talked about in
9       great deal in the submission itself.  Again,
10       this is just the table of contents.
11           And then in the next document they presented
12       the results of their own mouse skin-painting
13       studies showing that they had produced
14       carcinomas.  If you look at that far column
15       there, carcinomas.  So Dr. Cummings confirmed --
16       carcinoma, that's another word for cancer.
17       Nicotine's role in smoking was also covered in
18       the nine-volume submission.
19           Next document.  In volume 4 Liggett says --
20       actually, let's skip that one.
21           Let's go to the next one.  Save time.
22           "Nicotine is the highly active pharmacologic
23       agent in tobacco."
24           "The pleasurable effects of nicotine are the
25       reasons why people smoke tobacco instead of some

1       other material."
2           "Nicotine is a potent stimulant of various
3       chemo receptors."
4           Dr. Cummings talked about that and how, you
5       know, it's all this new science about the effect
6       of nicotine on the brain.  We told them that
7       back in 1963.
8           It goes on to say, "It's one of the most
9       potent central nervous system arousal agents
10       known."
11           So you can see, contrary to what
12       Dr. Cummings told you, the conclusions contained
13       in the L&M perspective that you were shown as
14       evidence that Liggett was hiding the ball, we
15       told them that back in 1963.
16           Okay.  So I'm going to have to jump ahead.
17           You heard about industry organizations.
18       Liggett wasn't a member of the TIRC.  It only
19       belonged to the Council for Tobacco Research
20       from March '64 until January '68.  It was a
21       minor player with insignificant financial
22       contributions to both the CTR and the TI.  CTR
23       contribution was .3 percent and TI was .79
24       percent.
25           You know, what documents did you see from

1       any Liggett personnel directing the Tobacco
2       Institute?  None.  Liggett didn't introduce a
3       single smoking gun document into evidence.  If
4       we were hiding the ball, where is that evidence?
5           You saw a lot of ads.  Some of them are
6       Liggett ads.  A bunch of them are going back
7       with you into the jury room.  Liggett ads had
8       nothing to do with Mary Cooper smoking,
9       obviously.  She didn't smoke a Liggett product.
10           Then moving on to punitive damages since I'm
11       running out of time.
12           Punitive damages are intended to punish a
13       defendant for its conduct.  You need to decide
14       whether there's any evidence that any alleged
15       wrongful conduct by Liggett caused damage to
16       Ms. Cooper and whether it's necessary to send a
17       message to Liggett to punish us for her injuries
18       and the way Liggett is currently doing business.
19           Today Liggett is the smallest of the major
20       tobacco companies with about 2 percent of the
21       market, little Liggett.  In '96 it was the first
22       company to publicly admit that smoking causes
23       disease and is addictive.  And it continues to
24       do business today as a responsible cigarette
25       manufacturer should.

1           Now, we all have sympathy for Ms. Cooper.
2       The medical challenges she has faced and met
3       have been significant and difficult.  But that
4       doesn't mean that Liggett is responsible for her
5       injury or that we should be required to pay
6       money damages to her.
7           Now, there are essentially two questions on
8       the verdict form for Liggett.  It's question
9       five, the conspiracy question.  I would request
10       that you check "no" off on that.  And you will
11       be instructed if you check "no" as to Liggett on
12       that question to go down to question seven,
13       which is the fault question, and enter zero.
14           Bottom line, plaintiff hasn't met her
15       burden.  There's no support for her claim for
16       money damages or punishment against Liggett in
17       this case.  And I request that you return a
18       verdict in our favor.  And I too thank you very
19       much for your time.


25           MR. PEDROSA:  Thank you.

1           May it please the Court?
2           Thank you.  On behalf of my client
3       Lorillard, on behalf of my partner Karen, and
4       for me I want to thank you.  The job you're
5       doing is an incredibly important one.  I think
6       every lawyer in the room agrees with that.  We
7       might not agree on much, but we agree with that.
8       And the sacrifice that you've made, it's
9       incredible.  You've been here, by my count, for
10       21 eight-hour full business days and a couple of
11       hours a day before filling out -- or day or two
12       before filling out a questionnaire.  That's an
13       incredible sacrifice.
14           I found out yesterday that I was going to be
15       the last one to speak with you, so I was trying
16       to figure out last night, well, how do I want to
17       close up what I want to say?  And
18       Mr. Schlesinger is actually going to be the last
19       one to speak with you, but I'll be the last one
20       on our side.  And I thought what probably made
21       the most sense, what would probably be the most
22       helpful is to pick up where I started in the
23       opening statements three week ago.
24           Three weeks ago I told you that this case
25       was going to be about Mary Cooper.  It was going

1       to be about the warnings she received over the
2       years, her entire life, it was going to be about
3       the decisions she made and it was going to be
4       about responsibility for those decisions, her
5       responsibility.  And the reason I said that is
6       that you're the only jury anywhere in the world
7       at any time that's ever got to hear Ms. Cooper's
8       case.  This is Ms. Cooper's case.  She is suing,
9       she's suing for 22.3 million dollars in this
10       case, and you're the only jury that has heard
11       evidence about her claims.
12           Mr. Schlesinger talked to you about the
13       Engle case and the Engle jury and the findings
14       that that jury made.  That jury didn't hear a
15       word about Mrs. Cooper.  That's why this case is
16       about Mrs. Cooper.  This is where we get to
17       decide.  You have the power to decide
18       Ms. Cooper's claims.
19           All the evidence that you heard in this
20       case.  For three weeks you've been here
21       listening to evidence proved three simple facts
22       that are going to help you decide every question
23       that you have to answer on the verdict form.
24           First, Mary Cooper knew that smoking was
25       dangerous.  She knew it caused cancer.  She knew

1       that the entire time that she was a smoker.
2           Second, there's nothing that my client did
3       or said, Lorillard, that impacted Ms. Cooper's
4       decisions.  She made her own decisions.  She
5       smoked when she wanted to smoke.  She took the
6       job she wanted to take.  She married the men she
7       wanted to marry.  She raised her daughter.  She
8       worked hard and she made decisions for herself.
9       And just like everyone else, just like everyone
10       in this room, just like the 300 people that sat
11       with us in that big courtroom downstairs when we
12       did jury selection, she's the only person
13       responsible for those decisions.
14           So I want to talk about the first one of
15       these.  Ms. Cooper knew that smoking was
16       dangerous.  Ms. Cooper got warning after warning
17       after warning that cigarette smoking caused
18       cancer.  Mr. Belasic went through them with you.
19       I'm not going to go back over all of that again.
20       I thought Mr. Belasic did a great job of
21       covering all that.
22           She got warnings from friends and family,
23       father, grandmother.  She got warnings from
24       magazines, Reader's Digest, which she told me, I
25       asked her like two questions, she told me her

1       dad subscribed to Reader's Digest and so did
2       she.  She saw the news of the Surgeon General's
3       Report in 1964.  It was everywhere she said.
4       Her husband, her first husband, Mr. Bray, the
5       very last witness who testified in this case,
6       said, yeah, in the 1960s when she and I got
7       married when we're in high school everybody knew
8       that cigarette smoking caused cancer.  Her
9       brother said it.  Nobody said it was good for
10       you.
11           Ms. Cooper understood all that.  We know she
12       got that message.  There's absolutely no doubt.
13       How do we know it?  Well, we know it because she
14       said it, but we also know it because she was
15       warning other people not to smoke.  That's what
16       she told the dancers at her club, the Take One
17       Lounge, that's what she told her daughter.  She
18       got that message.  Mrs. Cooper wasn't duped.
19       She wasn't confused, and she wasn't deceived.
20       She knew that cigarettes were dangerous.  She
21       knew they could cause cancer.  She knew it so
22       well that she was warning other people, hey,
23       don't smoke.  It's bad for you.  I know I do it.
24       But don't do it.  It's bad for you.
25           Number two, Mrs. Cooper's decisions weren't

1       impacted by anything that Lorillard did or said.
2       Now, remember Ms. Cooper never even picked up a
3       cigarette made by my client until the 1980s.
4       And even then she only smoked them for about
5       four years.  And she said, I can't say that ads
6       had anything to do with me starting to smoke
7       Newport.
8           You remember Mr. Johnstone kept asking her
9       that question.  He asked her like three times.
10       Well, was it the ads that made you smoke
11       Newport?  And she said, ah, can't really say
12       that.  Was it a vending machine, is that why you
13       smoked Newport?  And she said, I can't really
14       say that.  Probably what happened is someone at
15       the club handed me one and I liked the way it
16       taste and so I smoked those for about four
17       years.
18           Wasn't because of ads, wasn't because of
19       anything that Lorillard said or did.  And when
20       it came to Ms. Cooper's decision to smoke
21       Newport cigarettes for those four short years
22       the medical evidence in this case was that four
23       years of smoking isn't enough.  It's not a long
24       enough time to cause cancer.
25           Now, Mr. Davis mentioned this to you, he

1       talked about Dr. Mudad and Dr. Shapiro.  You
2       know, you heard from a lot of doctors, and you
3       heard from them for a long time.  And so I
4       thought you might want to see what Dr. Mudad and
5       Dr. Shapiro actually said on this point.  They
6       both said the same thing.  They said it takes 10
7       pack years of smoking to cause cancer.
8           And you remember my partner Ms. Bray, she
9       hasn't asked a lot of questions in this trial,
10       but she got up and that's the one question she
11       asked Dr. Shapiro.  And Dr. Mudad said it in his
12       video.  Dr. Mudad was asked, is there an amount
13       of smoking below which you would say that the
14       smoking history did not cause a particular
15       cancer?  He said, yeah, about 10 pack years.
16       Dr. Shapiro agreed.  Those are the only two
17       doctors in this case who were asked that
18       question and they both said the same thing.  And
19       when it came to Lorillard you heard it from
20       Ms. Cooper herself, nowhere near 10 years.  Four
21       years.
22           Number three, Ms. Cooper is 100 percent
23       responsible for her decisions.  You know, all of
24       us make decisions about her health every single
25       day.  Do we smoke or not?  Are we gonna order

1       health food?  Are we going to order a veggie
2       sandwich, or are we going to order a burger and
3       fries?  Are we going to have a beer, or are we
4       going to not drink?  Everyone makes those
5       decisions.  Every person in this room, every
6       person in this country, everyone takes
7       responsibility for the decisions they make.
8       Everyone in this room does that.  And they don't
9       take 5 percent responsibility for the decisions
10       they make.  They certainly don't take 1 percent
11       responsibility.  We're all 100 percent
12       responsible for our own decisions.  Ms. Cooper
13       was no different.  She was the only person that
14       could make a decision to quit and could stick to
15       it.  No one could do that for her.  Not her
16       parents, not any of her husbands, not her
17       daughter, not you or me, not Lorillard, not
18       RJ Reynolds, not Philip Morris, not Liggett.
19       Ms. Cooper is the only one who could make that
20       decision.  And she made the decision to smoke,
21       to keep smoking and not to try to quit knowing
22       that there were health risks, because it's
23       something that she enjoyed doing.
24           She never tried to quit in the 1960s when
25       the Surgeon General's Report came out when she

1       saw the news about it, when her husband Charles
2       says that everyone knew, including her, that
3       cigarette smoking was dangerous.  She never
4       tried to quit in the 1970s.  During those four
5       years that she smoked my client's cigarettes,
6       1980 to 1984, she never tried to quit during
7       those four years.  She said that the first time
8       she tried to quit was maybe around 1986, 1987
9       using nicotine gum.  She said she tried to quit
10       in the early 1990s using the patch and then a
11       couple of times in between, so maybe about four
12       times she tried, never for more than an hour,
13       hour and a half, two hours.
14           You know, it occurred to me you folks have
15       been here eight hours a day for 21 days.
16       Ms. Cooper never tried to quit smoking for
17       longer than it takes to watch a movie or listen
18       to a closing argument.  None of this, I said
19       this in my opening statement, none of this is
20       intended to be a criticism.  Nobody is blaming
21       Ms. Cooper for making the decisions she made.
22       It's her life, her decisions, she's allowed to
23       make them.  That is one of the great things
24       about this country, we live and have that
25       freedom to make decisions for ourselves,

1       decisions about our own health, about our own
2       bodies.  But with the freedom to make those
3       decisions comes responsibility.  And just like
4       anyone else, Ms. Cooper is the only person 100
5       percent responsible for her own decisions.
6           Now, that's why I think as you go through
7       the verdict form in this case your verdict
8       should be for the defendants.  And honestly,
9       that's why the very first question on the
10       verdict form that Mr. Belasic talked to you
11       about which asks you whether it was addiction
12       that legally caused her disease the answer to
13       that question is no.  It wasn't addiction that
14       caused her disease.  Ms. Cooper made her own
15       decisions, and addicted or not, 60 million
16       Americans have quit smoking.  All of them have
17       one thing in common, they made a decision to do
18       it and they stuck to that decision.  Ms. Cooper
19       could have made the same decision, and that's
20       why your answer to this question should be no.
21           Now, if you do get past that question, I
22       don't think you should, but if you do, there are
23       a few questions that you have to answer
24       individually for each of the defendants.  And so
25       I just want to cover those very quickly.

1           The questions I want to talk about, three,
2       four, five and six, you've been shown these
3       before.  I just threw them up on the screen.  I
4       know you can't read them there because it's too
5       small, but you will have the verdict form with
6       you.
7           All of these questions ask you something
8       similar.  They ask you whether Ms. Cooper
9       relied, reasonably relied on something that a
10       tobacco company said or didn't say and whether
11       that reliance was a legal cause of her injuries.
12       And what it all boils down to is this.  Was
13       Ms. Cooper having all of those warnings around
14       her knowing what she knew, having seen what she
15       saw, was she waiting around for someone from a
16       tobacco company to come knocking on her door and
17       tell her something else?  Was she sitting there
18       waiting to do that before deciding how to live
19       her life?  If she wasn't, and I submit to you
20       that she was not, then your answer to these
21       questions is no, not just for Lorillard, but for
22       all of the defendants in this case.
23           You know, the next question, question seven
24       is the one that asks you really straight out
25       something that I've been talking about since we

1       got here, and that is this concept of
2       responsibility.  I've gone through all the
3       evidence.  Ms. Cooper was the only one that
4       could make the decision to quit.  Ms. Cooper is
5       100 percent responsible for the decisions she
6       makes.  And I think that's what you should write
7       down on that line for Ms. Cooper.  And that
8       means that the rest of them are zeroes.
9       Ultimately it's up to you.  If you get to this
10       question, you'll have to decide it like all of
11       the others.  Whatever you write down for
12       Ms. Cooper, for Lorillard I submit to you that
13       the number should be zero, not 15 percent, not
14       20 percent, not 5 percent.  It should be zero
15       because, as I said, there's nothing that
16       Lorillard did or said that had an impact on
17       Ms. Cooper.  She didn't smoke Newport cigarettes
18       because of ads.  She told you that.  She didn't
19       smoke Newport cigarettes for long enough to
20       cause her disease.  The doctors told you that.
21       And so that number should be zero.
22           Mr. Davis already spoke to you about the
23       damages in the case and so I'm not going to go
24       back over that again, but I do want to talk to
25       you about the very last question on the form,

1       and that's question 11 which asks about punitive
2       damages.
3           And, you know, Mr. Davis read to you some of
4       the instructions about what it means to award
5       punitive damages and the standard that the
6       plaintiff has to meet in order to get -- and
7       it's a different standard from the rest of the
8       case.  It's what we call clear and convincing
9       evidence.  And clear and convincing evidence is
10       evidence that's more persuasive, more compelling
11       than anything else in the case.  It's evidence
12       that's so precise, so explicit, so lacking in
13       confusion that it produces a firm conviction in
14       your minds.
15           What does all that mean?  It means you've
16       got to be really, really, really sure that the
17       conduct that you want to punish was
18       intentionally designed and did actually harm
19       Ms. Cooper.  And in thinking about that you've
20       got to think about all the evidence in this
21       case, the evidence about the warnings that
22       Ms. Cooper was surrounded by, the evidence about
23       the knowledge that she had going back to the
24       1950s and the 1960s that smoking was harmful.
25       And you also have to think about the evidence

1       that you heard in this case about my client,
2       about Lorillard.
3           You remember when Dr. Cummings was on the
4       stand, he was here all week and then I got to
5       ask him a few questions at the end of the day on
6       Friday.  For some reason I'm always asking
7       questions at the end of the day.  I went through
8       with Dr. Cummings what Lorillard did.  Remember
9       I started -- he started his presentation in
10       December of 1953 and he talked about that's when
11       these experiments with the mice and the skin and
12       the tumors were being widely publicized and he
13       said the tobacco companies were freaking out
14       because the stock prices were going down.
15           MS. BRAY:  Three minutes.
16           MR. PEDROSA:  Three.  Thank you.
17           And in January of 1954, the very next month,
18       Lorillard was stepping forward and volunteering
19       to help Dr. Wynder, the same scientist whose
20       mouse skin-painting experiments were causing all
21       the uproar, Lorillard stepped up to volunteer to
22       provide free cigarettes in helping with issues.
23       And Lorillard kept working with Dr. Wynder in
24       the 1950s and throughout the 1960s.
25           And Lorillard worked with Dr. Hoffman.  You

1       remember we talked about Dietrich Hoffman from
2       the Sloan-Kettering Institute.  And Dr. Cummings
3       said he was one of the giants in the public
4       health community during these years.
5           And Dr. Cummings testified that Lorillard
6       was sharing information with him about
7       carcinogens in cigarettes.
8           Mr. Belasic gave you additional examples for
9       all that companies.  He talked about the
10       National Cancer Institute and how the tobacco
11       companies were working with the Tobacco Working
12       Group to try to explore ways to do what?  To
13       design a safer cigarette.  That was the whole
14       mission of that group, to come up with a safer
15       cigarette.  That's not any company intentionally
16       trying to do harm.  Those are companies trying
17       to make a safer cigarette.
18           You heard about product placement in movies.
19       Dr. Cummings told you, no, Lorillard didn't do
20       that.  But even with the other companies, you
21       saw the clips, you saw the Superman.  He told
22       you, well, there's cigarettes in Superman.
23       Yeah, there's cigarettes in Superman.  There's
24       also Superman telling Lois Lane that she's going
25       to get lung cancer if she doesn't quit smoking.

1           Ladies and gentlemen, there's no evidence in
2       this case that Lorillard intended to harm
3       Ms. Cooper.  There's no evidence in this case
4       that anything Lorillard did harmed Ms. Cooper.
5       That's why your answer to this question should
6       be no.
7           I'll end where I started.  Ms. Cooper knew
8       the dangers of smoking the entire time she was
9       smoking.  She made her own decisions and they
10       had nothing to do with anything that my client
11       said or did.  Just like anyone else she's the
12       only person responsible for the decisions that
13       she made.
14           Again, I just want to thank you for giving
15       me your attention.  Mr. Schlesinger is going to
16       get back up here and have another opportunity to
17       speak with you, and I hope that you give him the
18       same attention that you gave to all of us.
19       Thank you.
