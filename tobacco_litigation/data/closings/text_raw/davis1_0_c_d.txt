CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE 
14:51:52
MR. McCARTER:  And good afternoon, ladies and
14:51:53
gentlemen.  I'm happy to be able to talk to you at the end
14:51:56
of this case.  And thank you for your time and attention
14:51:58
throughout the trial.  And I say that on my behalf and on
14:52:01
behalf of the folks who are working with me, at the office,
14:52:03
behind the scenes, putting in the effort day and night
14:52:06
here.
14:52:06
As we've done throughout the case, I'm going to
14:52:10
take most of the defense time up.  I'm going to talk about
14:52:14
arguments and reasons and evidence that applies to both
14:52:16
defendants.
14:52:17
And then you're going to hear from Miss Patterson,
   169
14:52:20
 1
who will talk about reasons, additional reasons, why you
14:52:23
 2
should find in favor of her client, R.J. Reynolds.
14:52:26
 3
So I want to start by really picking up where I
14:52:29
 4
left off in my opening statement.  And that is talking
14:52:33
 5
about what the evidence showed in this case.  You may
14:52:36
 6
recall I talked about this about six days ago.
14:52:38
 7
What the evidence showed was that Mrs. Davis was
14:52:42
 8
aware of the risks of smoking.
14:52:44
 9
MR. BYRD:  Objection as to time, age.
14:52:52
THE COURT:  Well, if we reach that, we will get to
14:52:55
it.  I don't think we have to reach that yet.
14:52:58
Go ahead.
14:52:58
MR. McCARTER:  That Miss Davis smoked because she
14:53:01
enjoyed smoking.  That she was able to quit when she wanted
14:53:04
to quit.  That Mrs. Davis was not affected by anything the
14:53:09
tobacco companies said or did.
14:53:10
And I'm going to go through these one by one,
14:53:12
starting with her awareness of the dangers of smoking.
14:53:18
Because what you've seen in the evidence is that for
14:53:20
39 years, the last 39 years of her smoking, Mrs. Davis was
14:53:24
warned of the risks on every single package of cigarettes
14:53:29
she smoked.
14:53:30
There's no dispute in this case that R.J. Reynolds
14:53:32
and Philip Morris complied with the law and put this
14:53:36
warning on every package of cigarettes they sold in the
   170
14:53:38
 1
United States between 1966 and 1970.
14:53:43
 2
No dispute about it.  That was on every pack of
14:53:48
 3
cigarettes Miss Davis smoked during those years.
14:53:50
 4
The warning changed in 1970.  And from 1975 to
14:53:53
 5
'85 -- 1970 to '85, this was the warning on all of
14:54:00
 6
Mrs. Davis' packs.
14:54:01
 7
She testified that she knew the warnings were on
14:54:05
 8
her packs and she understood the warnings.  She understood
14:54:07
 9
the message they were telling her, that cigarette smoking
14:54:14
was dangerous to her health.
14:54:15
No dispute that R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris
14:54:19
complied with the law and put this warning on every package
14:54:22
of cigarettes they sold during those years.
14:54:25
Then, of course, in 1985, the warning changed
14:54:27
again.  And for the last 20 years Mrs. Davis smoked, one of
14:54:34
these four warnings would have been on every package of
14:54:37
cigarettes she smoked.
14:54:39
No dispute again that R.J. Reynolds and Philip
14:54:41
Morris complied with the law at all times and put one of
14:54:43
these warnings on every package of cigarettes.
14:54:46
Mrs. Davis was warned of the very disease she
14:54:49
would get, emphysema, 13 years before she got it.  She had
14:54:53
a warning on her pack speaking specifically to that
14:54:56
disease.
14:54:56
Now, plaintiff's counsel earlier did an analogy
   171
14:55:02
 1
where he was talking about, well, what if -- what if we
14:55:06
 2
found out later that cell phones are causing cancer?
14:55:10
 3
But what he didn't use in his analogy was what if
14:55:13
 4
your cell phone had a warning on it every time you picked
14:55:17
 5
it up that told you, warning, using a cell phone causes
14:55:20
 6
cancer?
14:55:21
 7
That's the analogy here.  That's what Mrs. Davis
14:55:24
 8
had.  For 39 years that she was using her cigarettes, there
14:55:28
 9
were warnings that she would have seen every time she
14:55:30
picked up her pack.
14:55:31
And in the advertising, when she saw advertising
14:55:34
after 1971, 1972, every one of those ads would have had a
14:55:40
warning on it as well.
14:55:41
But warnings were not the only source of
14:55:44
information for Mrs. Davis about the dangers of smoking.
14:55:51
We know from the evidence, and you've seen it, that her
14:55:53
friends and family members talked to her about the risks of
14:55:56
smoking throughout the years.
14:55:59
MR. BYRD:  Objection.  Vague as to time.
14:56:04
THE COURT:  Well, I'm just going to say this once,
14:56:06
and I don't think defense counsel is suggesting anything
14:56:11
different.
14:56:11
But we do not hold children to the same standard
14:56:18
as adults in terms of making decisions.  So the question of
14:56:25
voluntariness is really in relation to her as an adult
   172
14:56:30
 1
after the age of 18.
14:56:32
 2
MR. McCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
14:56:33
 3
And these warnings were all on the packs when she
14:56:36
 4
was an adult.  And these conversations with her friends and
14:56:38
 5
family members all occurred when she was an adult.
14:56:41
 6
Remember, her husband, Jackie, quit smoking in the
14:56:45
 7
early 1970s.  He quit cold turkey.  And he and Miss Davis
14:56:50
 8
used to smoke together.
14:56:56
 9
Miss Davis said in her deposition -- and you heard
14:56:56
this read -- that the only thing he said after he quit, the
14:56:57
only thing he said was he wasn't going to buy her
14:57:00
cigarettes anymore.
14:57:01
But what you heard when she was cross-examined
14:57:03
yesterday is that Mr. Davis did, in fact, talk to her after
14:57:09
he quit smoking.  He told her it was bad for her health.
14:57:13
He told her she should quit.
14:57:14
That was the same message Miss Davis was getting
14:57:17
to her over the years from her sons.  Her son Jackie talked
14:57:21
to her about her smoking in the 1970s and 1980s and said
14:57:25
she should quit.  She had the same conversation with David.
14:57:27
She had the same conversation with Tommy.
14:57:30
She talked to her brother Cecil.  He was the one
14:57:33
who quit smoking when the smoke was choking him.  He
14:57:36
couldn't breath.  He told her all about it, and he told her
14:57:38
how he quit.
   173
14:57:39
 1
And you heard today from Fran Craft.  Now, let me
14:57:43
 2
back up a second.  Because Fran Craft was the person that
14:57:46
 3
Mrs. Davis said before the lawsuit knew the most about her
14:57:50
 4
smoking.  You heard her testify yesterday that she filled
14:57:53
 5
out a form.  She was asked to list the name of people who
14:57:58
 6
know about her smoking.  And she listed one name.  And that
14:58:02
 7
was Fran Craft.
14:58:03
 8
We brought you Fran Craft's testimony today.
14:58:05
 9
MR. BYRD:  Objection.  Misstates the testimony.
14:58:11
THE COURT:  Excuse me?
14:58:11
MR. BYRD:  It misstates the facts in evidence
14:58:13
about the verified worksheet.  She's supposed to list
14:58:16
anybody that had any knowledge of all of her claims and
14:58:20
damages.
14:58:20
THE COURT:  No.  I think this is fair argument.
14:58:22
Overruled.
14:58:23
MR. McCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
14:58:24
She listed one person, Fran Craft.  Who brought
14:58:28
Fran Craft's testimony to you?  We did.
14:58:30
We didn't bring you experts who had been paid
14:58:32
$3 million or $1 million or $350,000 who say the same thing
14:58:38
in every case in which they're getting paid.
14:58:41
We brought you testimony from the one person she
14:58:43
listed as having knowledge about facts in this case.  And
14:58:46
what did Fran Craft say?  She said she always talked to
   174
14:58:50
 1
Mrs. Davis about her smoking.
14:58:51
 2
She told Mrs. Davis she should quit.  What did
14:58:56
 3
Mrs. Davis say in response?  We would laugh it off and say,
14:59:00
 4
I don't want to quit smoking because I enjoy smoking.
14:59:03
 5
And she did enjoy smoking.  And she was aware of
14:59:06
 6
the risks of smoking.
14:59:07
 7
Mrs. Davis' doctors talked about her smoking with
14:59:13
 8
her.  That's just some of the medical records you've been
14:59:16
 9
shown.  But you know that going back to the 1960s,
14:59:19
Mrs. Davis' doctors were telling her to quit smoking while
14:59:22
she was pregnant.  They repeated the message in all three
14:59:25
of her pregnancies.
14:59:27
Then in the time we have medical records, you saw
14:59:29
notes in the medical records telling Mrs. Davis, counseling
14:59:32
her to discontinue smoking.
14:59:35
She was getting messages from her doctors as well.
14:59:38
These messages sunk in.  There is no dispute about it,
14:59:42
because I asked Mrs. Davis this yesterday.
14:59:44
I asked her, going back to the mid-1960s when you
14:59:49
were in your 20s, you knew that smoking was bad for your
14:59:53
health.
14:59:56
When you were 25 years old, you knew smoking was
15:00:00
bad for your health, correct?
15:00:01
Answer:  True.
15:00:02
From age 25 on, for the last 50 years, Mrs. Davis
   175
15:00:07
 1
knew smoking was bad for her health.
15:00:09
 2
Now, you heard yesterday when plaintiff's counsel
15:00:12
 3
was questioning Mrs. Davis, he asked, well, when you were a
15:00:16
 4
little girl living in Tampa, did anybody warn you that
15:00:22
 5
cigarette smoking was addictive?
15:00:24
 6
And he may have gotten an answer he didn't expect.
15:00:27
 7
But the answer was yes.  Yes, people told me that.
15:00:31
 8
Now, I'm not saying that to suggest that
15:00:34
 9
Mrs. Davis is to blame as a ten-year-old for disregarding
15:00:38
that advice.  But my point is that the information about
15:00:40
addictiveness, that it's hard to quit smoking was so
15:00:43
widespread that a ten-year-old girl in Tampa in a rural
15:00:48
area knew about it and was warned about it.
15:00:52
That's how widespread knowledge was about how hard
15:00:55
it was to quit tobacco, going back for hundreds of years,
15:00:58
for a hundred years or more.
15:01:00
Now, the evidence also shows that Miss Davis
15:01:05
smoked because she enjoyed smoking.  You saw a video of her
15:01:09
deposition where she testified that she loved smoking.  She
15:01:14
loved smoking.
15:01:15
And yesterday when she testified, she testified
15:01:18
again that she enjoyed smoking and that she told her
15:01:21
friends over the years that she enjoyed smoking, that she
15:01:24
told them that she enjoyed smoking before she ever filed
15:01:27
this lawsuit.
   176
15:01:32
 1
And I talked about Fran Craft's testimony.  You
15:01:34
 2
heard that earlier today.  We read it to you.
15:01:40
 3
Mrs. Davis told her that she did not want to quit
15:01:43
 4
because she enjoyed smoking.  And yesterday when Mrs. Davis
15:01:46
 5
testified, she admitted that that's what she told Fran
15:01:49
 6
Craft.
15:01:49
 7
Miss Davis also said that she enjoyed smoking
15:01:58
 8
Marlboro cigarettes, that they were her favorite cigarette.
15:02:01
 9
And she also said -- and this is important at the
15:02:04
bottom -- that she continued to smoke Marlboro as her brand
15:02:07
for all the years she smoked it.
15:02:11
Because you enjoyed them, correct?
15:02:13
The image you're getting from plaintiff's counsel
15:02:15
and plaintiff in this entire case is that Mrs. Davis was a
15:02:19
victim to her addiction, a victim to addiction who was
15:02:22
driven to smoke compulsively.
15:02:24
That's not why she smoked.  She smoked because she
15:02:27
loved it and she enjoyed it.
15:02:29
She knew the risks, but it was something she
15:02:31
enjoyed doing.  And she was willing to accept the risks to
15:02:34
do it.
15:02:35
MR. BYRD:  Objection.  Assumption of risk,
15:02:38
Your Honor.
15:02:53
THE COURT:  Well, let me say this to you, ladies
15:03:02
and gentlemen.  If you were to find on the one hand that
   177
15:03:09
 1
Miss Davis was addicted and that addiction was a sufficient
15:03:19
 2
cause of her COPD and you were also to find that she was
15:03:22
 3
aware of that risk and still insisted on smoking, you would
15:03:27
 4
still, in that situation, have to find for the plaintiff.
15:03:33
 5
Because the addiction that caused her to continue
15:03:40
 6
smoking, even though she couldn't -- there's a different
15:03:42
 7
issue whether she could have stopped.  But the mere fact
15:03:45
 8
that she knew of the risk when she undertook smoking is not
15:03:53
 9
a defense if the addiction was the cause of her COPD.
15:04:00
Go ahead, counsel.
15:04:02
MR. McCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
15:04:04
Third, the evidence shows that Mrs. Davis was able
15:04:06
to quit smoking when she wanted to quit.
15:04:09
The fact is that Mrs. Davis was not interested in
15:04:12
quitting smoking for a very long time.
15:04:14
When she heard from the Surgeon General in the
15:04:18
1960s that smoking was bad for her health, she was not
15:04:23
interested in quitting and did not try to quit.
15:04:25
When she saw the warnings on her packs in the
15:04:27
1960s and the 1970s and afterward, she was not interested
15:04:31
in quitting and didn't want to quit.
15:04:33
When her husband Jackie quit in the 1970s, she was
15:04:36
not interested in quitting.
15:04:38
When her children urged her to quit smoking in the
15:04:40
'70s and '80s, she was not interested in quitting.
   178
15:04:44
 1
When Fran Craft, her friend, said, you should quit
15:04:46
 2
smoking, in the 1990s and 2000s, she said she didn't want
15:04:51
 3
to quit.  She enjoyed the cigarettes.
15:04:53
 4
And when her doctors advised her to quit, first
15:04:55
 5
when she was pregnant and later in life, she was not
15:04:59
 6
interested in quitting.
15:05:00
 7
And what she said to her sons, I think, speaks
15:05:05
 8
volumes.  Because what she told her sons when they said,
15:05:09
 9
Mom, you should quit, she said, leave me alone.  I know
15:05:14
it's bad for my health.  It's my decision to smoke.  And
15:05:18
that I will quit when I want to quit.
15:05:21
And that's exactly what she did in 2005.  She quit
15:05:25
when she wanted to quit.
15:05:26
This is from her friend Fran Craft that you heard
15:05:35
this morning.
15:05:36
Did Mrs. Davis ever tell you, ever indicate to you
15:05:40
that she had any interest in quitting smoking?
15:05:43
The answer:  No.
15:05:44
I submit to you that's about as opposite as you
15:05:49
can get from what the plaintiff is telling you in this
15:05:51
case.  And this is evidence from before this lawsuit was
15:05:55
filed, evidence as to Miss Davis' reaction when Miss Craft
15:06:01
would talk to her about her smoking.
15:06:03
What Miss Davis said before the lawsuit was filed
15:06:06
was, I don't want to quit smoking.  I enjoy smoking.  And
   179
15:06:10
 1
that's why she smoked.
15:06:11
 2
And, you know, you've seen this record.  You've
15:06:16
 3
seen this board numerous times.
15:06:20
 4
But even as we get into the last year of
15:06:24
 5
Mrs. Davis' smoking, her doctor is counseling her to quit
15:06:27
 6
smoking.  And he writes down, at this time she does not
15:06:30
 7
seem receptive to it.  October 2004, that's what her doctor
15:06:38
 8
writes down.
15:06:38
 9
That is -- remember, this is year 19 of that
15:06:42
supposed 20-year marathon quit attempt using the Waterpik
15:06:47
filters, where she says she's trying to quit for 20 years.
15:06:50
And her doctor is trying to help her quit.  And whatever
15:06:53
she says to him, he writes down, she's not receptive to his
15:06:57
message about quitting smoking.
15:06:59
Now, you may remember when Dr. Cummings was here,
15:07:04
I showed this record to him.  And then there were some
15:07:08
questions asked later suggesting that the reason Mrs. Davis
15:07:11
didn't want to quit at this point in time was because she
15:07:13
was taking care of her son Tommy.
15:07:17
You didn't hear that from Mrs. Davis yesterday.
15:07:20
Dr. Cummings was talking about it.  But Mrs. Davis did not
15:07:23
say that.
15:07:23
And, in fact, this is two years after Tommy was
15:07:25
injured.  And Mrs. Davis was saying the same thing to Fran
15:07:31
Craft before Tommy was hurt.  And when she wound up
   180
15:07:34
 1
quitting, she quit and Tommy was still hurt.
15:07:37
 2
So this had nothing to do with her son's injury.
15:07:40
 3
Mrs. Davis didn't claim it did.  It was only Dr. Cummings
15:07:43
 4
making that claim.
15:07:44
 5
MR. BYRD:  Objection.  Misstates testimony of
15:07:46
 6
Dr. Cummings.

THE COURT:  The jury's recollection will govern.
15:07:55
 8
And I want to mention to you, ladies and gentlemen
15:07:57
 9
-- I think I mentioned this before -- if at any time during
15:08:01
your deliberations you're unsure of what someone said, just
15:08:06
send us a note.  And we'll find the testimony and we'll
15:08:09
send it back to you so you don't have to speculate.
15:08:13
We can tell you definitively.  We can provide you
15:08:16
with the actual transcript of what was said about any
15:08:19
particular matter.
15:08:20
In this matter, I don't recall one way or the
15:08:23
other.  So your recollection will govern.
15:08:26
MR. McCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
15:08:26
Just a few months later, she did quit in 2005.  So
15:08:32
what changed?  What changed -- and you remember this from
15:08:35
her testimony -- is that she decided she had spent too much
15:08:37
money on cigarettes, and she was tired of spending money on
15:08:41
cigarettes.
15:08:42
She had nine cigarettes left in her pack.  She
15:08:44
smoked them all in a row.  And she did something she had
   181
15:08:47
 1
never done before.  And that is she threw away her pack.
15:08:52
 2
She threw away her ashtrays.  She threw away her lighters.
15:08:56
 3
Because at that point in 2005, she had finally
15:08:59
 4
made the decision that she wanted to quit smoking.
15:09:01
 5
And once she made that decision, it was as simple
15:09:04
 6
as smoking the cigarettes in the pack, throwing everything
15:09:07
 7
away, and she never smoked again.
15:09:09
 8
Now, before that when you heard from their
15:09:17
 9
witnesses that she's trying and trying and trying and
15:09:18
wanting and wanting to quit but just can't do it, before
15:09:21
she did that in 2005, she never went 24 hours without
15:09:29
smoking; she never threw away her ashtrays and lighters and
15:09:33
cigarettes.
15:09:34
There's no evidence that Mrs. Davis ever told
15:09:36
anybody that she wanted to quit before she quit in 2005.
15:09:40
And there's no evidence that anyone saw her try to quit
15:09:43
before she quit in 2005.
15:09:44
And this is important because the evidence is that
15:09:50
if Mrs. Davis had decided to quit earlier and just finish
15:09:54
her pack and throw her lighters and ashtrays and cigarettes
15:09:59
away, if she had done that sooner, before she got sick, she
15:10:05
never would have gotten COPD.  
15:10:07
MR. BYRD:  Objection, Your Honor.  Causation.
15:10:10
Conflating the issue.  Looking at the screen.
15:10:23
THE COURT:  Let me hear the last sentence re-read.
   182
15:10:25
 1
Oh, wait a minute.  Here it is.  Sorry.
15:10:28
 2
Overruled.
15:10:41
 3
MR. McCARTER:  This is from their own witness'
15:10:43
 4
testimony.  This is Dr. Burns.  He admitted if she had quit
15:10:46
 5
smoking, if a smoker quits before they have damage to their
15:10:49
 6
lungs, they are not going to go on to get COPD.
15:10:53
 7
And Mrs. Davis had that opportunity for years and
15:10:54
 8
years and years, from the time she learned the dangers of
15:10:58
 9
smoking when she was 25 up until whenever it was that she
15:11:02
first damaged her lungs.
15:11:04
MR. BYRD:  Objection.  Causation.
15:11:27
THE COURT:  I think we're going to need a quick
15:11:29
sidebar.  I'm sorry.
15:11:30
Counsel?
15:11:30
(Discussion at sidebar on the record.)
15:11:59
THE COURT:  So on the third required prong, I've
15:12:09
already told the jury that addiction is sufficient cause,
15:12:15
that the fact that she knew about it doesn't matter.
15:12:18
What is it that you --
15:12:20
MR. BYRD:  Well, I think this goes to -- you gave
15:12:21
the instruction on the third question, on smoking, whether
15:12:27
she could quit or not wasn't -- it's really the same deal.
15:12:31
We do that because it's a causation question.
15:12:33
It's basically saying that she knew this and she
15:12:37
could have quit earlier.  There was no causation.  She had
   183
15:12:40
 1
the ability to quit.  Instead, I think we're just getting
15:12:43
 2
too far afield from what causation is all about.
15:12:48
 3
THE COURT:  This is the -- I think the argument we
15:12:55
 4
had at the charging conference -- I think that under the
15:12:57
 5
law, as I understand it, this is still a third required
15:13:04
 6
finding of members of the class.  It's not a thereafter
15:13:07
 7
clause.
15:13:09
 8
As you know, I instructed the jury can't use
15:13:13
 9
thereafter.
15:13:16
MR. BYRD:  We use after for comparative fault.
15:13:18
THE COURT:  Yeah.
15:13:19
MR. BYRD:  It shouldn't be used in causation.
15:13:21
MR. McCARTER:  I'm not even arguing in the context
15:13:23
of a specific verdict form question.  I'm just talking
15:13:26
about what the evidence shows.  If it's relevant to one of
15:13:29
the claims, there shouldn't be these objections.
15:13:32
THE COURT:  And I agree.  I think I'm a little
15:13:34
concerned, although I do think the objections are fair, to
15:13:36
clarify.  
15:13:36
I don't think defense counsel said anything wrong.
15:13:47
But there was some ambiguity, and it should be clarified.
15:13:51
I think an extension of risk can be clarified.  So I think
15:13:54
this one is still within the realm of argument.  I won't
15:13:58
have an instruction at this time.  
15:14:02
I'll keep it under consideration as we go forward.
   184
15:14:14
 1
All right.
15:14:16
 2
(End of discussion at sidebar.)
15:14:33
 3
MR. McCARTER:  If Mrs. Davis had quit smoking when
15:14:35
 4
she was 25 years old and knew that smoking was bad for her
15:14:38
 5
health, she would have avoided getting COPD.
15:14:41
 6
If she had quit when the warning went on the pack
15:14:43
 7
in 1966, she would have avoided getting COPD.
15:14:48
 8
If she had quit in 1970 when the warning changed,
15:14:51
 9
she would have avoided getting COPD.
15:14:54
If she had quit in the '70s and '80s when her
15:14:58
husband and her sons were talking to her about her smoking,
15:15:01
she would have avoided getting COPD.
15:15:03
In 1985 when the warning specifically warned her
15:15:06
of the disease she would get 13 years later, if she had
15:15:09
quit then, she would have avoided getting it.
15:15:13
THE COURT:  Now, again, I'm sorry, counsel.
15:15:14
I need to just remind you, ladies and gentlemen,
15:15:17
because this needs to be kept in mind.
15:15:26
If you find that she was already addicted and you
15:15:31
find that the addiction would have caused her ultimate
15:15:41
COPD, then the fact that she could have quit may be
15:15:47
relevant for comparative fault.  But it's not a total
15:15:52
defense.
15:15:53
So just keep that in mind.  It goes to -- in that
15:15:57
context, you will have to determine, well, was, you know,
   185
15:16:05
 1
was she -- how much of a fault for her disease did she bear
15:16:10
 2
some blame for because she didn't quit?
15:16:13
 3
So it's highly relevant to the case.  But it's not
15:16:15
 4
a total defense.  It would still be liable.
15:16:19
 5
MR. McCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
15:16:24
 6
The evidence also showed that Mrs. Davis was not
15:16:27
 7
affected by anything the tobacco companies ever said or
15:16:29
 8
did.
15:16:31
 9
Plaintiff's counsel has put a lot of those sticky
15:16:34
things, those sticky notes on that timeline over there.
15:16:38
And I told you in my opening that -- to be on the lookout.
15:16:40
They're going to show you a lot of old documents and old
15:16:43
videos and old ads.
15:16:44
But the question is, what, if anything, does it
15:16:46
have to do with Mrs. Davis?  And I submit to you that if
15:16:51
you took off all the stickies on there that are things that
15:16:54
she never saw or heard or knew about or was affected by, if
15:16:57
you stripped their board of all those stickies that had
15:17:00
nothing to do with her, this is what their board would look
15:17:08
like.
15:17:08
Because none of the statements they showed, none
15:17:11
of the videos they played, none of the advertisements they
15:17:14
showed you had anything to do with Mrs. Davis.
15:17:16
And we know that because that's what Mrs. Davis
15:17:21
said yesterday.
   186
15:17:25
 1
Mrs. Davis testified yesterday that she never
15:17:28
 2
heard any tobacco companies' statements.  Nothing.
15:17:33
 3
Question:  You don't remember ever seeing or
15:17:35
 4
hearing a statement by anyone from the tobacco companies at
15:17:38
 5
any time, correct?
15:17:40
 6
Answer:  Correct.
15:17:41
 7
What's on that board over there has nothing to do
15:17:46
 8
with Mrs. Davis.  Nothing on there, no statement by the
15:17:49
 9
tobacco companies about smoking and disease or addiction.
15:17:53
She never heard it.  It never had any effect on her.
15:17:58
What about cigarette advertising?
15:18:01
Remember, we had Dr. Kyriakoudes there for three
15:18:04
or four hours talking about advertising?
15:18:09
Then I asked him, first question on
15:18:11
cross-examination:  Does anything you're talking about, are
15:18:13
you saying, telling the jury it has something to do with
15:18:16
Mrs. Davis?
15:18:18
Her as an individual?  No.
15:18:20
So he spent three or four hours talking about
15:18:22
things that there's no evidence had anything to do with
15:18:25
her.
15:18:25
And we know from Dr. Burns, he reviewed the
15:18:30
depositions and the medical records.  And he talked about
15:18:33
cigarette advertising intercepting people as they're trying
15:18:37
to quit.
   187
15:18:37
 1
Well, I asked Dr. Burns.  And he testified that
15:18:40
 2
advertising did not influence her to start.  If that's -- I
15:18:44
 3
think that's a fair statement.
15:18:45
 4
So their own witness is saying, cigarette
15:18:49
 5
advertising is not what caused Mrs. Davis to start smoking.
15:18:53
 6
And, of course, you know from Mrs. Davis' testimony that
15:18:56
 7
she was not influenced by cigarette advertising.  This was
15:19:01
 8
long, so I'm not going to read it.
15:19:03
 9
But she's -- she didn't have a television growing
15:19:08
up.  She didn't see ads on television for cigarettes before
15:19:11
she started smoking.  She wasn't influenced by television
15:19:14
advertising to go out and buy a pack of cigarettes.
15:19:17
In fact, she did not even choose her brands.  She
15:19:20
didn't choose her brands based on cigarette advertising.
15:19:23
She chose her brands based on what people gave her when she
15:19:27
was younger.
15:19:27
Then when she was an adult, she chose her brand
15:19:30
based on what her husband bought.  He brought the
15:19:33
cigarettes home, and she smoked what he bought.  She wasn't
15:19:36
influenced by advertising.
15:19:37
Now, the rest of the time I want to spend talking
15:19:42
about the verdict form, because that's going to be your
15:19:43
job, of course, is to get the verdict form to deliberate
15:19:47
together and to answer the questions that are posed to you.
15:19:49
And I want to walk through the questions on the
   188
15:19:52
 1
verdict form.  But before I do, I want to say something
15:19:55
 2
about this burden of proof, because with the exception of
15:19:59
 3
the comparative fault issue, the plaintiff bears the burden
15:20:03
 4
of proof on everything.
15:20:05
 5
And they bear the burden of proof to provide you
15:20:07
 6
with credible evidence.  Credible evidence.  Evidence you
15:20:11
 7
can believe in and trust that allows you to conclude that
15:20:15
 8
they met their burden of proof.
15:20:16
 9
Now, there's a statement in here that you don't
15:20:20
decide whether they meet their burden of proof the way
15:20:22
counsel suggested, by stacking up the number of witnesses
15:20:25
on both sides and saying they called more witnesses, they
15:20:29
used more of your time, so they win.  That's not the way it
15:20:32
works.
15:20:32
It does not mean the greater number of witnesses.
15:20:37
And one reason why is because we go second.  We have the
15:20:41
benefit of cross-examining their witnesses.  And when we
15:20:45
ask their witnesses questions and they give us answers,
15:20:48
that is evidence you're getting from us.
15:20:51
And we put in a lot of evidence, hours and hours
15:20:53
of evidence from when we cross-examined Dr. Burns and
15:20:59
Dr. Kyriakoudes and Dr. Cummings and Mrs. Davis and then we
15:21:02
brought you Fran Craft.
15:21:03
So this nonsense about us not bringing evidence is
15:21:07
just that.  It's nonsense.  Because what you learned from
   189
15:21:10
 1
our cross-examinations of their own witnesses is that
15:21:14
 2
people have known for a hundred years or more that
15:21:17
 3
cigarettes are harmful to your health, that they're hard to
15:21:20
 4
quit.  That people have been using terms like coffin nails
15:21:24
 5
and cancer sticks and nicotine fiend and nicotine fit going
15:21:28
 6
back to the 1800s.
15:21:30
 7
You heard that when we cross-examined their
15:21:33
 8
witnesses.  That is evidence that we are bringing to you.
15:21:35
 9
You learned that it was common knowledge that
15:21:40
people knew before Mrs. Davis was ever born that smoking
15:21:44
was hard to quit.  And it was such common knowledge that it
15:21:46
was communicated to her as a kid.
15:21:48
You learned about those 1950s studies that were
15:21:52
published in all of the magazines and newspapers linking
15:21:55
smoking to lung cancer when we cross-examined their
15:21:58
witnesses.
15:21:58
You learned that by 1954, 95 percent of Americans
15:22:02
in 1954 had heard or read something to the effect that
15:22:07
smoking caused cancer.  That was our evidence.
15:22:10
You were shown the document that talked about
15:22:14
addiction as a reason people smoked in 1959.  And what you
15:22:18
learned when we cross-examined their witness was that the
15:22:21
person who wrote the document was simply copying down
15:22:25
reasons why people smoked that he read in a newspaper and
15:22:28
saw in surveys and that there wasn't any secret research
   190
15:22:31
 1
showing cigarette smoking was addictive.
15:22:35
 2
What you learned in our cross-examinations was
15:22:37
 3
that when the tobacco companies had a list of carcinogens
15:22:41
 4
and cigarette smoke in the early 1960s -- they showed a
15:22:46
 5
Philip Morris document, for example -- Philip Morris gave
15:22:48
 6
that list of carcinogens over to the Surgeon General.
15:22:52
 7
And then the Surgeon General then thanked Philip
15:22:54
 8
Morris and thanked R.J. Reynolds specifically for their
15:22:57
 9
contributions to that 1964 report.
15:23:00
You learned about the warnings when we
15:23:03
cross-examined their experts.  You learned about television
15:23:05
advertising coming off of TV and radio in 1971 when we
15:23:09
cross-examined their experts.
15:23:12
You learned about 30 million people quitting
15:23:15
smoking between 1964 and 1979 when we cross-examined their
15:23:20
experts.  You also learned that one of those 30 million
15:23:23
people was Mrs. Davis' husband.
15:23:25
You learned that today somewhere between 55 and 65
15:23:28
million Americans have quit smoking and that there are more
15:23:33
former smokers in this country than there are current
15:23:36
smokers.
15:23:36
And through our cross-examination of Mrs. Davis,
15:23:38
you learned all the stuff we just talked about, about how
15:23:41
she knew the risks of smoking, going back to when she was
15:23:45
25 years old.
   191
15:23:46
 1
And you also learned that her COPD did not
15:23:50
 2
manifest until 1998.  That's what you learned yesterday
15:23:54
 3
when we showed the medical records from Mrs. Davis'
15:24:00
 4
doctors.
15:24:00
 5
And that's the issue I want to turn to right now,
15:24:03
 6
because its first on the verdict form.
15:24:05
 7
And what I thought I would do is try to give you a
15:24:13
 8
sense of the big picture on this issue right now.  And then
15:24:17
 9
I'm going to show you the documents.
15:24:18
So this is the timeline of the events, the
15:24:20
evidence relating to her COPD.  And you see here, there's a
15:24:24
thick line there.  That's November 21, 1996.  And, of
15:24:28
course, that's the important date, right, because she has
15:24:31
to prove that her COPD manifested before that date.
15:24:34
So here's all the evidence showing that she had
15:24:39
COPD before that date.  And there's just nothing on there.
15:24:43
And I'm going to talk about Dr. Burns' testimony
15:24:45
since they talked about that.  But there's no evidence.
15:24:48
There is no evidence that Mrs. Davis had COPD before this
15:24:51
date.
15:24:52
All the evidence relating to her COPD and her
15:24:57
shortness of breath comes after 1996.
15:25:04
So the story is, the relevant story is that
15:25:08
Mrs. Davis is an active-duty police officer in Waldo from
15:25:12
1985 to February 22, 1998.
   192
15:25:15
 1
And on that day, she breaks her ribs.  She breaks
15:25:19
 2
her ribs on the job.  She then goes and sees Dr. Velasquez.
15:25:24
 3
Dr. Velasquez is her family doctor in Gainesville.
15:25:28
 4
And so she breaks her ribs.  She's goes to see
15:25:32
 5
Dr. Velasquez.  And we know that sometime after this
15:25:34
 6
happens, after February '98, she has her first pulmonary
15:25:39
 7
function test.
15:25:41
 8
Now, you remember that pulmonary function test is
15:25:43
 9
that breathing test that is used to see if somebody has
15:25:46
COPD.  Dr. Burns talks about it.
15:25:49
I'm going to show you Mrs. Davis' testimony.  But
15:25:52
you may remember already from yesterday, she said she did
15:25:55
not have a test like that until after she quit the police
15:25:58
force.  So after February 1998.
15:26:00
Then a month later, she's in the hospital, and it
15:26:08
references the history of COPD.
15:26:10
Well, we know to diagnose COPD she has to have a
15:26:13
pulmonary function test, because Dr. Burns talked about
15:26:16
that.  And the record, which I'll show you, references her
15:26:19
having had one.
15:26:20
So she must have had that pulmonary function test
15:26:23
sometime in the month between February 22 and March 22,
15:26:32
1998, because we know the test was done after she quit the
15:26:32
police force but before she was in the hospital in March.
15:26:36
MR. BYRD:  Objection, Your Honor.  Misstates
   193
15:26:37
 1
testimony.  These are not Dr. Velasquez's records.
15:26:47
 2
THE COURT:  No.  The argument is being made
15:26:49
 3
inferentially from a circumstantial basis.
15:26:56
 4
So, ladies and gentlemen, you should understand as
15:26:56
 5
to arguments from both counsel, and particularly on this
15:26:57
 6
issue, that they're -- both counsel are trying to
15:27:04
 7
reconstruct the relevant time period from inferences from
15:27:11
 8
circumstantial evidence.
15:27:11
 9
So that's perfectly permissible.  Under Florida
15:27:17
law, doctors don't have to keep their records more than
15:27:19
five years.
15:27:21
Some of them do, some of them don't.  But you've
15:27:23
already heard that records from some periods are missing.
15:27:31
Missing in a sense that we don't know where they are.  The
15:27:33
doctor could have legitimately destroyed them or whatever.
15:27:36
So counsel for both sides can quite properly make
15:27:40
arguments to you that you should conclude that she
15:27:44
developed and manifested COPD at X time or Y time, and
15:27:50
you'll make your own decision after you've heard all of the
15:27:54
arguments.
15:27:54
MR. McCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
15:27:55
MR. BYRD:  Just to be clear, my objection is
15:27:57
referencing -- I'm happy to tell you at sidebar.  I wasn't
15:28:00
referencing Dr. Velasquez's records.  I was referencing
15:28:04
testimony.
   194
15:28:05
 1
THE COURT:  I think that's clear.  There's no -- I
15:28:08
 2
don't recall -- counsel can correct me if I'm wrong -- I
15:28:10
 3
think that the record is clear that Dr. Velasquez's records
15:28:17
 4
from this period are not available.
15:28:21
 5
MR. BYRD:  The argument was that she saw
15:28:24
 6
Dr. Velasquez in February and March of '98.  Using these
15:28:28
 7
records, that's not true.  Those records aren't from
15:28:31
 8
Dr. Velasquez.
15:28:32
 9
THE COURT:  Well, I don't want you testifying.
15:28:39
I will hear you briefly at the sidebar.
15:28:41
(Discussion at sidebar on the record.)
15:29:02
THE COURT:  He's making a circumstantial argument
15:29:04
as to when the test might have occurred.  The only thing I
15:29:11
found at fault in defense counsel's thing was his statement
15:29:16
that there was no evidence.  
15:29:19
That's really what you were saying is that there's
15:29:24
no evidence you should accept that she had COPD because
15:29:29
there is documents in evidence which you're going to get
15:29:32
to.  There was the reference about her history, which the
15:29:33
document shows.  I don't see anything wrong with that
15:29:39
specifically.
15:29:42
MR. BYRD:  Well, what he started saying was, he
15:29:43
said in March of '98, she saw Dr. Velasquez.  And using
15:29:47
this and saying that that's where Dr. Velasquez did this.
15:29:54
In my record, it's not Dr. Velasquez.  In fact,
   195
15:29:55
 1
there's no records from Dr. Velasquez.  He's trying to make
15:29:59
 2
it sound like February of '98 with the ribs.
15:30:02
 3
THE COURT:  So when is the ribs?
15:30:04
 4
MR. BYRD:  The ribs is February 22, '98.  That is
15:30:07
 5
not -- that is not Dr. Velasquez.  It's the other doctor.
15:30:11
 6
He said it was.
15:30:14
 7
MR. McCARTER:  She testified yesterday that before
15:30:16
 8
she went to the hospital, she saw Dr. Velasquez.  She
15:30:20
 9
referred her.  That's what I'm talking about.
15:30:22
THE COURT:  I agree.  I agree.  That's what she
15:30:23
said.  I agree.
15:30:25
Overruled.
15:30:26
(End of discussion at sidebar.)
15:30:41
MR. McCARTER:  Okay.  Back to the overview here,
15:30:42
and then I'll show you the actual documents.  She has her
15:30:45
first pulmonary function test after 1998.  That's a
15:30:48
necessary thing to diagnose somebody with COPD, according
15:30:50
to Dr. Burns.  That did not happen until 1998.
15:30:55
What about symptoms of COPD?  She talked about
15:30:59
being overheated in the sun when she was working traffic
15:31:02
duty.  Now, you're standing on hot asphalt and you're in
15:31:07
your late 50s in a hot police officer outfit and it's the
15:31:10
middle of summer.  Is it a surprise that you get
15:31:14
overheated?
15:31:15
Was there any evidence -- is there any evidence
   196
15:31:17
 1
that the overheating was the result of COPD?
15:31:19
 2
What did she do when she got overheated?  Did she
15:31:24
 3
go to a pulmonologist?  No.  She didn't do that until after
15:31:27
 4
1998.
15:31:28
 5
She went in her car and turned on the air
15:31:30
 6
conditioning just like anybody else would do.  There's no
15:31:34
 7
evidence tying that overheating to COPD, no evidence at
15:31:37
 8
all.
15:31:37
 9
What the evidence is is that there was no
15:31:39
shortness of breath.  By the time you get into the spring
15:31:43
of 1998, that's what she's telling her doctors.  She's had
15:31:47
no problems breathing.  July 1998.
15:31:49
Then later she has another pulmonary function test
15:31:52
in August, and it suggests a diagnosis of emphysema.
15:31:57
Suggests a diagnosis of emphysema.
15:31:59
And then we have a record saying shortness of
15:32:01
breath.  Not back before 1996.  Shortness of breath
15:32:05
recently.
15:32:07
So as you're looking for symptoms of COPD, the
15:32:10
first shortness of breath report in the medical records is
15:32:15
1998, September, when it's recent.
15:32:19
So let's go through, because this is obviously --
15:32:22
this is where I would submit to you that your deliberations
15:32:25
do start on this.  This is question one.
15:32:28
But I would submit to you they start and end on
   197
15:32:30
 1
this question because there is just no evidence from which
15:32:33
 2
you could conclude that she had COPD by the date she needs
15:32:38
 3
to prove it.
15:32:38
 4
Okay.  So let's go on.  When was the first
15:32:46
 5
pulmonary function test, right?  Because she can't be
15:32:49
 6
diagnosed with COPD until she has that test.
15:32:52
 7
She testified she does not remember having such a
15:32:54
 8
test until after she left the police force.  That's 1998.
15:32:58
 9
This is her testimony from yesterday, that she
15:33:01
remembers having a test done in 1998.  She does not
15:33:04
remember having a breathing test done on her lungs before
15:33:07
that.
15:33:10
That's what the evidence is.  So the first
15:33:13
pulmonary function test in evidence is 1998.
15:33:16
Then we get to her March 22 record.  Past medical
15:33:20
history.  Remarkable for chronic obstructive pulmonary
15:33:24
disease.
15:33:25
Now, counsel made a big deal of the word history,
15:33:27
like we're going back to Christopher Columbus or George
15:33:33
Washington or something.  But there was evidence to tell
15:33:34
you how far we're going back.
15:33:36
Because what you know is that for her to have a
15:33:39
history of COPD, she has to have had a pulmonary function
15:33:42
test.  And we know the pulmonary function test was not
15:33:46
until after February of '98.  So it had to be that one
   198
15:33:50
 1
month before.
15:33:51
 2
Is there other evidence that she had recently had
15:33:53
 3
a pulmonary function test?
15:33:55
 4
You bet.  Later in the record, it talks about she
15:33:58
 5
has had pulmonary function tests here in this hospital and
15:34:02
 6
that they suggested mild-to-moderate obstructive
15:34:07
 7
ventilatory defect.
15:34:08
 8
So put the evidence together, the test they're
15:34:11
 9
referring to here that she has had is the one that she had
15:34:14
after she left the police force, in February of 1998.
15:34:22
Continue forward, May 20, 1998, no shortness of
15:34:25
breath.  But remember, she has those broken ribs.  And when
15:34:28
she breathes in deeply, it hurts.  It hurts.
15:34:31
Now, I asked her about this record yesterday.  And
15:34:33
she said, no, no, I didn't tell my doctor I didn't have
15:34:38
shortness of breath then.  But I did tell him the rest of
15:34:39
the sentence.
15:34:40
She agreed that the rest of the sentence was
15:34:43
accurate.  I submit to you that the whole sentence is
15:34:45
accurate and that she did not have shortness of breath, she
15:34:48
did not have symptoms of COPD in May of 1998, a year and a
15:34:54
half after the cutoff on here.
15:34:56
July 1998, she has had no problems breathing.  No
15:35:04
problems breathing, July 1998, except for when she breathes
15:35:09
in deeply, her ribs hurt.
   199
15:35:11
 1
This was another one.  I don't remember telling my
15:35:13
 2
doctor I didn't have shortness of breath.  But the rest of
15:35:15
 3
the sentence is right.
15:35:16
 4
The whole sentence is right.  The doctor wasn't
15:35:19
 5
making it up.  She did not have symptoms of COPD in July
15:35:24
 6
1998.
15:35:29
 7
But after that, something happens where she goes
15:35:31
 8
into the hospital up in Gainesville, and she does have
15:35:34
 9
another pulmonary function test.  That's the one where they
15:35:37
say it suggests diagnosis of emphysema.
15:35:40
She then goes to see a different doctor in
15:35:43
September, and she tells the doctor that she's having
15:35:47
shortness of breath recently.
15:35:48
So that's -- everything I talked about on this
15:35:51
timeline, you've just seen in the evidence.  You've just
15:35:54
seen what the evidence shows, that everything points to the
15:35:58
COPD manifesting after, well after, in fact, the cutoff.
15:36:05
Now, there's another piece of evidence here, and
15:36:07
that comes from this medical record.  Because the doctor
15:36:12
went on to give her advice and said that she should be
15:36:18
evaluated by a pulmonologist.
15:36:21
And she said, well, I'd rather see my family
15:36:24
doctor.
15:36:24
And he said, well, that's fine, as long as they're
15:36:26
able to take care of your lungs.
   200
15:36:28
 1
And remember, I asked Mrs. Davis, I said, well, he
15:36:33
 2
was giving you that advice because up until this point in
15:36:36
 3
September of 1998 you didn't -- you hadn't been seeing a
15:36:40
 4
pulmonologist, right?
15:36:42
 5
And she said -- she said, no, I had not been
15:36:46
 6
seeing a pulmonologist before September 1998.
15:36:49
 7
If she had lung problems, if she had COPD, if she
15:36:54
 8
had shortness of breath, wouldn't she have been seeing a
15:36:56
 9
pulmonologist during that time?
15:36:59
Well, what she admits is that in September of
15:37:02
1998, getting close to two years after this cut-off, she
15:37:06
still had not been seeing a pulmonologist.
15:37:11
So on the question one on the verdict form, the
15:37:14
answer to this question is no.  And if you check it no,
15:37:17
you're done.  The case is over.  And that's where, I
15:37:20
submit, the case ought to end.
15:37:22
There's no mention of Mrs. Davis having COPD in
15:37:26
the medical records before 1998.
15:37:30
There's no testimony from any doctor who treated
15:37:32
her before 1998 that she had COPD before then.  Absolutely
15:37:38
no evidence of that.  And it's their burden of proof.
15:37:43
She didn't have a pulmonary function test done
15:37:46
before 1998.  She did not even have a pulmonologist she had
15:37:52
been seeing before 1998.
15:37:55
These problems with her lungs happened after
   201
15:37:58
 1
November 21, 1996.
15:38:01
 2
So what about Dr. Burns?  Because that's what
15:38:05
 3
they're hinging their case on on this.  They're saying,
15:38:07
 4
well, Dr. Burns said if you have a moderate level of COPD,
15:38:11
 5
you've had it for two or three years or three or four
15:38:14
 6
years, whatever he said.
15:38:16
 7
What they didn't tell you about was the preface,
15:38:19
 8
what Dr. Burns said before that.  He wasn't talking about
15:38:23
 9
Mrs. Davis.
15:38:24
They have this world-renown pulmonologist, and he
15:38:28
never told you that Mrs. Davis had COPD before that date.
15:38:31
He never said that.  What he said was he was
15:38:35
talking about on average.  And he qualified it.  He was
15:38:39
standing here on this chart.  I remember standing over
15:38:42
there when he was doing it.
15:38:44
And he said, this is an average.  Whatever the
15:38:46
number was.  It's an average.  It's everybody.
15:38:51
Individuals, not everybody follows the average.
15:38:54
Some people decline, get into the COPD category faster.
15:38:58
Some people slower.  It's just individual.
15:39:00
This case is not about when the average smoker
15:39:03
would have had COPD.  It's about when Mrs. Davis had COPD.
15:39:08
And Dr. Burns said absolutely nothing about
15:39:12
Mrs. Davis.  And there's no other evidence regarding
15:39:15
Mrs. Davis other than the evidence that points to 1998.
   202
15:39:26
 1
So, look, how do you reconcile the evidence in
15:39:28
 2
this case?
15:39:29
 3
Look at what Mrs. Davis said, the facts and
15:39:31
 4
circumstances that led her to go to her doctor regarding
15:39:36
 5
her shortness of breath.  And let's look at what the
15:39:38
 6
evidence says as to when those things happened. 
15:39:41
 7
She testified yesterday that she had recent
15:39:45
 8
shortness of breath, that she went to Dr.  Velasquez, that
15:39:53
 9
she had a pulmonary function test, that she visited
15:39:56
different doctors, and that she had COPD and emphysema.
15:40:01
Okay.  So when did it happen, right?  That's what
15:40:04
she said happened.  Let's talk about when it happened.  We
15:40:07
just saw a recent shortness of breath, September 1998.
15:40:11
Visited Dr. Velasquez in February/March 1998.  First
15:40:18
pulmonary function test, 1998.
15:40:21
Visited different doctors.  We saw she visited a
15:40:25
Dr. Nelson and a Dr. Melton after visiting Dr. Velasquez,
15:40:29
1998.
15:40:34
COPD/emphysema diagnosis in the medical records,
15:40:37
1998.
15:40:38
How do we explain it?  I submit to you that the
15:40:41
explanation is what you saw yesterday from what Mrs. Davis
15:40:45
wrote after her deposition.
15:40:48
I'm not arguing that she's making up the sequence
15:40:50
of events as they happened.  She just disremembered them.
   203
15:40:56
 1
We have the benefit of the medical records.  This was 15,
15:40:58
 2
20 years ago.  And we know what the benefit of the medical
15:41:01
 3
records is when things happened.
15:41:03
 4
And when she was telling people dates and times in
15:41:05
 5
her deposition, it was the same thing yesterday, that all
15:41:08
 6
dates and times were guessed or estimated without actual
15:41:11
 7
knowing.
15:41:12
 8
And that explains why she's saying it was before
15:41:17
 9
1996 and why all the evidence in the case says it was 1998.
15:41:20
So when you get to this question on the verdict
15:41:26
form, the answer to the question is no.
15:41:35
Now, question two on the verdict form asks whether
15:41:37
the plaintiff has proved that she's addicted to nicotine.
15:41:40
And you have the definition the Court has given
15:41:42
you.  And I want to focus on a couple of elements of this.
15:41:45
One is they have to prove that she had a
15:41:48
compulsive need for and use of a habit-forming substance,
15:41:51
that she was compulsively smoking.  She had a compulsive
15:41:57
need for cigarettes.
15:41:58
And they have to prove also that she had
15:42:00
well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal.
15:42:04
They did not prove that she's addicted.
15:42:08
Mrs. Davis, there's no evidence that she was a compulsive
15:42:11
smoker.  She was able to quit when she wanted to quit.
15:42:15
When she quit, she did not have withdrawal symptoms.
   204
15:42:17
 1
And Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings, who they're
15:42:20
 2
hinging their testimony on, the testimony is not credible.
15:42:26
 3
Mrs. Davis, we saw the records where she's smoking
15:42:28
 4
half a pack a day.  We saw them when Dr. Cummings was here,
15:42:31
 5
because remember they didn't send Dr. Cummings those
15:42:33
 6
records.  And Dr. Cummings admitted that if he had seen
15:42:36
 7
those records, he would have had to score her the lowest on
15:42:39
 8
that part of his addiction test, not the highest, which he
15:42:42
 9
did.
15:42:43
Now, there's been different versions of this, but
15:42:46
one version is that Mrs. Davis, the medical records say she
15:42:50
was smoking half a pack a day or one pack a day for
15:42:53
50 years.  That's one version of it.
15:42:55
The other version is that she was smoking more
15:42:57
than that in the past, but she cut down to half a pack a
15:43:01
day after she got sick.
15:43:02
I would submit to you either way, it shows she's
15:43:05
not a compulsive smoker.  If she's limiting her smoking to
15:43:09
half a pack a day for 50 years, that's not compulsion.
15:43:13
If, instead, the other version is true that she
15:43:15
was smoking two or three packs a day and then cuts down to
15:43:18
half a pack a day and is able to stick with that, limit her
15:43:22
smoking to that for the next ten years, that shows she can
15:43:25
control her smoking.
15:43:26
But either way, there's no evidence that she was
   205
15:43:28
 1
compelled or driven or desperately needed cigarettes.  She
15:43:33
 2
was in control of her own smoking behavior at all times.
15:43:37
 3
I'm going to -- these are the records that show --
15:43:41
 4
that we showed Dr. Cummings.  I'm going to skip through
15:43:44
 5
them.  You've seen them.
15:43:45
 6
There's also no evidence, keep in mind,
15:43:51
 7
corroborating -- no other evidence, just Mrs. Davis'
15:43:54
 8
say-so -- corroborating her testimony that she wanted to
15:44:00
 9
quit smoking before 2005.
15:44:01
And there's no evidence corroborating her
15:44:03
testimony that she made a serious effort to quit before
15:44:06
2005.
15:44:07
There's no -- her testimony is the only evidence
15:44:08
on that.  They didn't bring you friends or family members
15:44:12
to back it up.  And it's not backed up by any of the
15:44:16
medical records either.
15:44:16
We talked about this earlier, but when Mrs. Davis
15:44:21
wanted to quit in 2005, she did quit.  And it was easy.
15:44:25
She threw everything away.  And she was done with it.
15:44:29
She could quit when she wanted to quit.  Before
15:44:32
that, she had never gone 24 hours without smoking.  She had
15:44:37
never thrown everything away.  She talked about that liquid
15:44:39
concoction she got from the pharmacist that made the
15:44:43
cigarettes taste bad.  What she did is she would let it
15:44:46
wear off and smoke.
   206
15:44:48
 1
She talked about the nicotine patch.  When she
15:44:50
 2
first got a prescription from her doctor for the patch, she
15:44:53
 3
didn't even go fill it.  Later she got a patch from the
15:44:57
 4
health department.  Then she smoked while using the patch.
15:45:02
 5
She would just take it off and smoke.
15:45:03
 6
And then you remember the health department said
15:45:05
 7
-- called her and asked her how her experience was.  And
15:45:09
 8
they said to her, if you're interested in quitting smoking,
15:45:12
 9
if you want help, call us back.  And she testified she
15:45:15
never called them back.  When she wanted to quit, she just
15:45:18
quit in 2005.
15:45:22
And when she finally decided to quit, she woke up
15:45:26
one morning and decided she wasn't going to smoke anymore.
15:45:29
In 2005, she said, was when she finally made the
15:45:33
decision that she was going to quit smoking.
15:45:34
And when she finally made that decision, what
15:45:37
happened?  She quit, and she quit for good.
15:45:40
She didn't have any problem quitting.  And when
15:45:46
she quit, she did not have withdrawal symptoms.
15:45:49
Remember, Dr. Cummings testified, he was talking
15:45:51
about withdrawal symptoms and he reviewed records and he
15:45:55
reviewed testimony.
15:45:57
Well, I asked Dr. Cummings, I said, isn't it true
15:45:59
that the only withdrawal symptom you could find when you
15:46:03
looked at everything they gave you was that she gained some
   207
15:46:06
 1
weight afterward.
15:46:07
 2
That's the only thing he could find in 2005 when
15:46:09
 3
she quit.  She gained some weight.
15:46:12
 4
And you may want to look in the medical records
15:46:13
 5
that are in evidence because you're actually not going to
15:46:17
 6
find any evidence that she did gain weight after she quit
15:46:21
 7
smoking.
15:46:23
 8
And, finally, a few words about Dr. Burns and
15:46:26
 9
Dr. Cummings.
15:46:29
They're paid millions of dollars in these cases.
15:46:33
Dr. Burns has been paid more than $3 million.  Dr. Cummings
15:46:37
has been paid more than $1 million.
15:46:38
They didn't even -- Dr. Burns was never
15:46:44
Mrs. Davis' doctor.  Neither of them talked to her,
15:46:47
interviewed her, interviewed any of her friends and family
15:46:50
before they said she was addicted.
15:46:51
Dr. Burns diagnosed her as addicted sitting in his
15:46:56
office 3,000 miles away in San Diego, California, without
15:47:00
ever meeting her.  They didn't know her when she was
15:47:03
smoking.
15:47:06
And both of them admitted that in every case they
15:47:08
come and testify, when they're getting paid the $4,800 per
15:47:12
day, in every case, they always tell the jury the same
15:47:15
thing; the smoker was addicted.
15:47:17
Do you have any doubt in your mind that when
   208
15:47:21
 1
Dr. Burns is getting paid $4,800 to testify, that he's not
15:47:26
 2
going to come in and tell the jury that the smoker was
15:47:30
 3
addicted?  Is there any doubt in your mind that he will
15:47:33
 4
give that testimony?  He says the same thing all the time.
15:47:36
 5
Both of them admit that not every smoker is
15:47:38
 6
addicted, but when they're involved in a lawsuit, guess
15:47:41
 7
what?  Every smoker is addicted.  That's their testimony.
15:47:44
 8
That's what they want you to find liability based on in
15:47:47
 9
this case.
15:47:51
They've reviewed all the evidence that they had.
15:47:54
Neither saw any evidence corroborating what Mrs. Davis was
15:47:57
saying about trying and trying to quit and failing.
15:48:01
Dr. Burns admitted it.  The only one who says
15:48:08
Mrs. Davis tried to quit is Mrs. Davis.  Nobody else said
15:48:11
that in the materials he reviewed.
15:48:12
And their testimony was full of holes and
15:48:14
inconsistencies.  I'm just going to cover a couple in the
15:48:16
interest of time.
15:48:17
But you remember Dr. Burns said on his direct that
15:48:21
Mrs. Davis was diagnosed by her doctors as addicted?
15:48:26
Then on cross-examination he had to admit, you
15:48:29
could look through all the medical records you looked at,
15:48:31
and they say they sent him everything, and you're not going
15:48:34
to find the word addicted, addiction, addictive, anything
15:48:38
like that in the medical records.
   209
15:48:39
 1
Because Mrs. Davis' doctors did not diagnose her
15:48:44
 2
as addicted to nicotine.
15:48:46
 3
The only people who diagnosed her are the people
15:48:49
 4
who had never met her and are getting paid for their
15:48:51
 5
testimony.
15:48:51
 6
Dr. Burns also showed you this chart here, I
15:48:57
 7
think, to convey that it's hard for people to quit smoking.
15:49:03
 8
But what he had to admit was if he used the standard for
15:49:04
 9
trying to quit that's used in this chart, by the rules of
15:49:07
the survey, you'd have to classify Mrs. Davis as never
15:49:12
having made a quit attempt until 2005.
15:49:15
By the rules of the survey he used in his direct
15:49:16
examination, he told you she was trying to quit over and
15:49:19
over and over again, but the rules of his survey wouldn't
15:49:23
count her as ever trying to quit until she did quit.
15:49:26
Now, Dr. Cummings sat here and tried to say that
15:49:28
there was a reference in her medical records to her trying
15:49:31
to quit smoking.
15:49:32
You might remember he was sitting up there.  He
15:49:34
had his medical records, and he's thumbing through and
15:49:36
thumbing through, and we're all sitting, waiting and
15:49:39
waiting and waiting for him to find one.
15:49:41
And then he finds one.  And he has to admit it
15:49:44
doesn't say that she actually tried to quit.  All it said
15:49:48
is that she said she will quit smoking.  There's not a
   210
15:49:52
 1
single reference in her medical records that she ever tried
15:49:55
 2
to quit smoking before she quit in 2005.
15:49:57
 3
And, of course, with Dr. Cummings we had the
15:50:05
 4
moments where he was shown medical records, after
15:50:08
 5
testifying she wanted to quit and wanted to quit and wanted
15:50:11
 6
to quit.  
15:50:11
 7
It turned out that the plaintiff's lawyers did not
15:50:14
 8
send him the medical records where she told her doctor she
15:50:17
 9
was not interested in quitting smoking.  They didn't give
15:50:20
that to him before he came here and said she wanted to
15:50:23
quit.
15:50:24
They didn't give him the medical record from 2003
15:50:26
where she said she was confident she could quit smoking.
15:50:30
Remember, this is year 18 of the supposed failure -- failed
15:50:34
quit attempt using Waterpik filters.  And she's telling her
15:50:37
doctor, I'm confident I can quit smoking.
15:50:39
They didn't give that to Dr. Cummings.  They
15:50:42
didn't give him this one.  She's not receptive to the
15:50:46
message to quit smoking.
15:50:48
And they didn't give him any of those records that
15:50:51
we showed where she said she was smoking half a pack a day,
15:50:54
where she admitted if he had scored her using that, she
15:50:57
would have had the lowest level on his test, not the
15:51:00
highest level.
15:51:03
So the jury instruction requires you to find that
   211
15:51:05
 1
she was a compulsive smoker and that she had physiological
15:51:09
 2
withdrawal symptoms.  And there simply is not evidence of
15:51:12
 3
either.
15:51:13
 4
For that reason, if you get this far, if you get
15:51:15
 5
past this question on the verdict form, your answer to
15:51:18
 6
question two should be no as well.
15:51:20
 7
The third question has to do with whether
15:51:24
 8
plaintiff has proved that Mrs. Davis' addiction -- this
15:51:30
 9
assumes you found her addicted -- was a legal cause of her
15:51:33
COPD.  And this is the instruction the Court will give you.
15:51:38
That question gets at if she was addicted, was she
15:51:41
heavily addicted?  Was she addicted enough that her
15:51:45
addiction contributed substantially to her continuing to
15:51:48
smoke so that if she had not been addicted, she would not
15:51:56
have gotten COPD?
15:51:57
And we've gone through a lot of the evidence
15:51:59
relating to this.  But Mrs. Davis' addiction was not a
15:52:04
cause of her COPD, and she smoked because she enjoyed
15:52:07
smoking.  That's why she smoked.  She didn't smoke because
15:52:09
of an addiction.
15:52:10
MR. BYRD:  Objection.  Violation of jury
15:52:14
instructions.  Causation.
15:52:22
THE COURT:  So I'm going to just read you in
15:52:23
advance to clarify this, ladies and gentlemen, that -- that
15:52:27
portion of my instruction that deals with legal causation.
   212
15:52:33
 1
I think you've already seen it on the board.
15:52:38
 2
But one of the things that you'll be asked is
15:52:45
 3
whether or not the plaintiff has shown that it's more
15:52:48
 4
likely than not, quote, that her addiction was a legal
15:52:53
 5
cause of her COPD in the sense that her continued smoking
15:52:59
 6
of cigarettes was, at least in part, a natural and direct
15:53:06
 7
result of her addiction.
15:53:07
 8
In this regard, plaintiff need not prove that
15:53:12
 9
addiction was the only reason Miss Davis continued to smoke
15:53:16
cigarettes.
15:53:16
She may, for example, have partly smoked them
15:53:21
because she enjoyed smoking.  But plaintiff must prove that
15:53:24
her addiction contributed substantially to her continuing
15:53:29
to smoke so that but for the addiction, her COPD would not
15:53:34
have occurred.
15:53:34
So the -- I don't think -- what you've seen is
15:53:46
counsel for the plaintiff emphasize one part of that
15:53:48
instruction, defense counsel's emphasizing a different part
15:53:53
of that instruction.
15:53:54
When you get it, you should look at the
15:53:56
instruction as a whole.  That's the way to figure out the
15:54:00
answer to these questions.
15:54:01
But counsel may continue.
15:54:04
MR. McCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
15:54:05
Addiction did not prevent Mrs. Davis from quitting
   213
15:54:07
 1
because she was not interested in quitting smoking.  And
15:54:14
 2
the cause of her COPD, Mrs. Davis' free choice is what
15:54:18
 3
caused her to smoke cigarettes and ultimately to get COPD.
15:54:22
 4
So if you get this far in the verdict form, your
15:54:26
 5
answer should be no.
15:54:27
 6
I'm going to skip to question five because
15:54:33
 7
Miss Patterson is going to talk about question four.
15:54:35
 8
Question five gets to this allocation of fault
15:54:39
 9
that was talked about earlier.
15:54:41
And if you get this far, I've asked you to
15:54:43
consider Mrs. Davis' own statements about her smoking, what
15:54:47
she knew about it, why she smoked, whether she wanted to
15:54:51
quit, when you consider this question.
15:54:53
Because this is what she said to people when they
15:54:57
talk to her about her smoking:
15:54:58
Leave me alone.
15:55:00
I know it's bad for my health.
15:55:03
It's my decision to smoke.
15:55:04
I enjoy smoking.
15:55:08
I don't want to quit.
15:55:11
I'll quit smoking when I want to quit smoking.
15:55:16
Those are statements made by somebody who is 
15:55:20
100 percent responsible for the choices they make and the
15:55:24
consequences that flow from those choices.
15:55:29
That's what people say when they are responsible
   214
15:55:30
 1
for their choices.  It's their decision.  They know it's
15:55:34
 2
bad for them.  They want to do it.  They'll stop doing it
15:55:38
 3
when they don't want to do it anymore.  And that was
15:55:41
 4
Mrs. Davis.
15:55:45
 5
And so if you get this far in the verdict form, I
15:55:47
 6
would ask you to put down 100 percent of the responsibility
15:55:51
 7
on Mrs. Davis, 0 percent on Philip Morris, 0 percent on
15:55:59
 8
R.J. Reynolds.
15:56:00
 9
MR. BYRD:  Objection, Your Honor.  Improper legal
15:56:01
argument.
15:56:13
THE COURT:  We'll take this up at the end of
15:56:15
summation.
15:56:16
MR. McCARTER:  Now, plaintiff's counsel talked
15:56:18
about, well, they're going to come up here and say it's all
15:56:21
her fault.  They're going to blame Mrs. Davis for her
15:56:24
smoking.
15:56:25
I am not blaming Mrs. Davis.  I am not blaming
15:56:28
Mrs. Davis.  But she filed this lawsuit.  And she is 
15:56:30
100 percent responsible for the choices she made and the
15:56:34
consequences that flow from those choices.
15:56:36
On the verdict form, the next questions, six and
15:56:42
eight, get at the same issue.  It's this fraudulent
15:56:46
concealment and the conspiracy claim.  And I want to show
15:56:48
you one of the important instructions here.
15:56:50
And that is what the plaintiff has to prove is
   215
15:56:54
 1
that the defendant created the misimpression that cigarette
15:56:56
 2
smoking was not a health hazard or was not addictive. 
15:57:02
 3
There's no evidence that Mrs. Davis ever had a
15:57:05
 4
misimpression about either of those things.
15:57:06
 5
She did not testify that she was confused about
15:57:09
 6
the risks of smoking at some point in time or she was
15:57:11
 7
confused about addiction.  There is absolutely no evidence
15:57:14
 8
that Mrs. Davis was ever confused about anything.
15:57:17
 9
The second half of this -- they have to prove
15:57:20
both -- is that she has to prove that she relied on a
15:57:23
misrepresentation and decided to continue to smoke.
15:57:27
That's where we get out of this issue of did she
15:57:30
actually hear and rely upon -- did she rely upon anything
15:57:33
the tobacco company said about the health risks of smoking?
15:57:37
And I covered this earlier, but the answer is
15:57:41
good.  This is from her own testimony.  This is from her
15:57:45
own testimony, and it's an admission that these questions
15:57:48
must be answered no.
15:57:49
She doesn't remember seeing or hearing a statement
15:57:52
from anyone from the tobacco companies at any time.
15:57:58
And we've gone through this, but you know she knew
15:58:01
from the mid-1960s on that smoking was dangerous.  And
15:58:06
you've seen this evidence and heard it over and over again,
15:58:09
the warnings.
15:58:10
She heard about cancer sticks.  What she talked
   216
15:58:13
 1
about with her sons and doctor and husband.  What she
15:58:15
 2
talked about with Fran Craft and her doctors in 2004 when
15:58:19
 3
she said she didn't want to quit.
15:58:21
 4
Advertising didn't influence her to start smoking
15:58:24
 5
or to smoke either.  I've gone through that.
15:58:26
 6
And so on these questions, the answer should be
15:58:29
 7
not liable as well, if you make it this far.
15:58:32
 8
Compensatory damages.  You should know that the
15:58:37
 9
plaintiffs are not asking for any money for Mrs. Davis'
15:58:42
medical bills.  They are not asking for money for medical
15:58:45
bills.  They're not asking for money for lost income when
15:58:48
she couldn't work.
15:58:49
What they are asking for is that $7 million for
15:58:52
pain and suffering that they say should be computed based
15:58:56
on how many puffs she took off a cigarette.
15:58:59
You're going to read the jury instructions.  The
15:59:01
number of puffs she took off a cigarette have nothing to do
15:59:03
with it.  It's completely irrelevant to that calculation.
15:59:07
And the $7 million is ridiculous.
15:59:10
Finally, there's a question on punitive damages on
15:59:13
here.  And this has a higher standard that the plaintiffs
15:59:17
have to prove by clear and convincing evidence.  There's
15:59:20
going to be an instruction in the packet about clear and
15:59:23
convincing evidence.
15:59:25
But they proved nothing in this case about clear
   217
15:59:27
 1
and convincing evidence.  And they certainly did not prove
15:59:30
 2
that they should get more money in the form of punitive
15:59:33
 3
damages.
15:59:34
 4
So that question also should be no.
15:59:35
 5
Now, I want to talk about two more things.  And
15:59:43
 6
that is I think -- I'm not sure we needed Dr.  Kyriakoudes
15:59:47
 7
here for three or four hours to talk about things that had
15:59:50
 8
nothing to do with Mrs. Davis.  But he had something useful
15:59:54
 9
to say, I submit, on this historical method.
15:59:56
And what he said is if you actually want to know,
15:59:59
get accurate information about what happened in the past,
16:00:01
what you do is you look at what people were saying and
16:00:04
doing at the time.
16:00:05
And I asked him, I said, well, that statement
16:00:08
applies not just to tobacco companies but to individuals.
16:00:12
And he agreed.
16:00:13
And that's essentially your task, is to go back
16:00:17
and try to figure out what's the truth with respect to
16:00:20
Mrs. Davis' smoking and her COPD several years ago.
16:00:24
So I would submit what you ought to do is to look
16:00:27
at what she was saying back then, what she was telling her
16:00:30
friends and her doctors, and what her medical records say,
16:00:32
not what people are saying now that a lawsuit is filed and
16:00:35
you want $7 million.  What people were saying at the time,
16:00:38
before they had no interest and maybe twisting things in a
   218
16:00:44
 1
way that might help their case.
16:00:45
 2
And if you do that in this case, what you see is
16:00:48
 3
that she knew smoking was bad for her health.  She was
16:00:51
 4
warned for 39 years.  There's no evidence that anybody saw
16:00:54
 5
her try to quit smoking.  She never told anybody.  There's
16:00:57
 6
no evidence she told anybody she wanted to quit smoking.
16:01:00
 7
What she told people is that she enjoyed smoking
16:01:05
 8
and did not want to quit.  And the records show she did not
16:01:08
 9
have shortness of breath and COPD until 1998.
16:01:12
Now, the whole time I've been here, I've been
16:01:14
resisting the temptation to grab that board and bring it
16:01:16
over here.  And I'm going to do it.  I know you've seen it
16:01:19
enough, but I want to point out one thing to you.
16:01:36
Do you remember when Dr. Burns was here?  He was
16:01:38
asked to assume that she had COPD in 1993 and 1994.
16:01:46
Remember when he was asked to assume it.  They didn't have
16:01:49
evidence of it.  They said assume it.  And I guess they'll
16:01:52
put on evidence later.
16:01:53
What they did here is they wrote on here, and they
16:01:57
left room.  For what?  What did they leave room for?  A
16:01:59
sticky.  Where's the sticky?  If they proved she had COPD
16:02:04
back then, where is the sticky?  They would have put it on
16:02:08
there.
16:02:09
That's enough to show you that in addition to all
16:02:11
the other evidence, when you go in the jury room, ask
   219
16:02:14
 1
yourself, where is the sticky?  Because if they had given
16:02:17
 2
you evidence she had COPD back then, you know, you know
16:02:20
 3
they would have put a sticky on there.
16:02:22
 4
They certainly didn't run out of paper.  It's
16:02:24
 5
because there is no evidence, there is no evidence that she
16:02:28
 6
had COPD before November 1996.
16:02:32
 7
And as I said earlier, I submit that's the first
16:02:35
 8
question and the last question you need to answer in this
16:02:38
 9
case.
16:02:41
So I appreciate your time and your attention.
16:02:43
And when you go back into the jury room, I ask you
16:02:46
to return a verdict for my client, Philip Morris, and for
16:02:50
Miss Patterson's client, R.J. Reynolds.
16:02:51
Thank you very much.


CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE DEFENSE 
16:03:19
MS. PATTERSON:  May it please the Court?  
16:03:20
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  It's a
16:03:23
pleasure to speak with you all again.  As you know, my name
16:03:25
is Jordon Patterson, and I represent R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
16:03:30
Company.  And you probably know at this point that I'm
16:03:33
going to be brief today.
16:03:34
Before I begin, I just want to take a moment to
16:03:37
sincerely thank you for the time that you spent, your
   220
16:03:40
 1
service in this case.  And I want to thank you personally
16:03:42
 2
and on behalf of my client, Reynolds.
16:03:46
 3
Now, during opening statements, I said that you
16:03:49
 4
wouldn't hear a lot from me during this trial, one, because
16:03:53
 5
Mr. McCarter would go first and he could cover the points,
16:03:55
 6
and I want to be respectful of your time and not waste your
16:03:58
 7
time.
16:03:58
 8
So Mr. McCarter just thoroughly walked you through
16:04:02
 9
the evidence in this case.  And what he said applies with
16:04:05
equal force to Reynolds, so I don't want to retread that
16:04:09
ground.
16:04:09
But you also didn't hear a lot from me in this
16:04:12
case for another reason.  And that's because Miss Davis did
16:04:16
not smoke Reynolds cigarettes for any substantial amount of
16:04:22
time, and that's what I want to focus on this afternoon.
16:04:25
Now, you're going to hear from Judge Rakoff that
16:04:27
you all are the judges of the facts.  And when it comes to
16:04:30
my client, the facts are of critical importance.  And
16:04:34
plaintiff has the burden to prove those facts to you.
16:04:37
Now, inside of a courtroom, in a lawsuit for money
16:04:40
damages, plaintiffs must give you proof.  And there just
16:04:44
isn't much proof in this case about Miss Davis' use of my
16:04:48
client's cigarettes.
16:04:49
So when I talked to you last time at the beginning
16:04:51
of this case, I told you that the only conclusion that
   221
16:04:55
 1
you'd be able to draw from the evidence about my client,
16:04:58
 2
Reynolds, is that to the extent Miss Davis smoked Reynolds'
16:05:03
 3
cigarettes, it wasn't for a long amount of time and it was
16:05:05
 4
a very long time ago.
16:05:07
 5
So what did we hear from Miss Davis about
16:05:10
 6
Reynolds' brands?
16:05:12
 7
Can we have the first slide, please?  Thank you.
16:05:16
 8
When Miss Davis first started, she puffed on
16:05:20
 9
cigarettes that her older brother had hidden under the
16:05:22
house.  She wasn't a regular smoker at this point in time.
16:05:25
She wasn't really smoking at all.  She wasn't inhaling.
16:05:28
She said she was just puffing.
16:05:29
She testified that her brother had a box of
16:05:32
cigarettes, and in that box were a couple of different
16:05:37
brands.  There was some Marlboro, some Philip Morris,
16:05:40
Camel, and Pall Mall cigarettes.
16:05:42
And only two of those brands were Reynolds brands,
16:05:46
Pall Mall and Camel.
16:05:48
Now, Miss Davis testified that she only smoked
16:05:53
Pall Mall one time.  That's it.  That's all plaintiff told
16:05:56
you about Pall Mall.
16:05:58
Now, what about Camel?  Camel was just one of
16:06:01
several brands that were in her brother's box of cigarettes
16:06:04
when she first started.
16:06:05
And Miss Davis didn't tell you that she ever
   222
16:06:07
 1
smoked Camel exclusively.  She was smoking other brands at
16:06:13
 2
the same time.
16:06:13
 3
And out of those many different brands, Camel was
16:06:15
 4
not her preferred brand.  In fact, Miss Davis testified
16:06:19
 5
that in the beginning of her smoking, she already had a
16:06:21
 6
preference for a different brand, not Camel.
16:06:24
 7
Plaintiff didn't bring you any proof that
16:06:27
 8
Miss Davis smoked a Reynolds cigarette after that period
16:06:32
 9
when she first started smoking.
16:06:34
Her only testimony as to when she smoked Camels
16:06:36
was when she first started smoking.  That's all you heard.
16:06:40
That's all the proof that plaintiff brought.  And you can't
16:06:43
assume that she smoking any brand, much less a Reynolds
16:06:46
brand, at any point in time unless plaintiff proves this.
16:06:50
And she didn't.
16:06:50
Now, the summary I just gave you is the extent of
16:06:53
the testimony that Miss Davis gave about my client's
16:06:57
brands.
16:06:57
So looking at the evidence, the absolute most that
16:07:01
you can fairly conclude is that Miss Davis smoked Reynolds
16:07:06
cigarettes for about a year, because she only smoked Camel
16:07:09
right when she first started smoking.  She wasn't even
16:07:12
inhaling.  And she wasn't smoking Camels exclusively.  She
16:07:16
was smoking other brands as well.
16:07:17
So that's about a year out of a 55-year smoking
   223
16:07:21
 1
history.
16:07:23
 2
Now, you've also heard no evidence that Miss Davis
16:07:26
 3
had any abnormal lung function when she was smoking or
16:07:30
 4
puffing Reynolds cigarettes.
16:07:34
 5
And that's important because Dr. Burns testified
16:07:36
 6
that if a smoker quits while they still have normal lung
16:07:40
 7
function, they will not develop COPD.
16:07:42
 8
So that means that if Miss Davis quit smoking all
16:07:46
 9
together, when she stopped smoking Reynolds cigarettes, she
16:07:50
would not have gotten COPD.
16:07:51
Now, I would like to focus on our chart about what
16:07:54
we heard about the limited amount that she smoked.  And I'm
16:07:57
going to tell you why that's important to my client and why
16:08:00
it's important for you guys to understand why that, that
16:08:04
limited amount, matters.  And it's because of something
16:08:07
called legal cause.
16:08:08
And as Judge Rakoff will tell you in some of his
16:08:11
instructions, plaintiff has the burden to prove to you that
16:08:14
smoking Reynolds cigarettes was sufficient to be a legal
16:08:17
cause of her COPD.
16:08:20
Now, legal cause is a cause, like the way that you
16:08:25
or I might use it, it's a term that has special legal
16:08:29
significance.  And you'll hear that in Judge Rakoff's
16:08:31
instruction.
16:08:32
You'll hear that plaintiff must prove that smoking
   224
16:08:37
 1
R.J. Reynolds cigarettes substantially contributed to
16:08:40
 2
Miss Davis' COPD.
16:08:42
 3
So look for that language when you hear it from
16:08:45
 4
the judge.  And I want to show you now where that's going
16:08:47
 5
to fit on the verdict form.  And that's going to be
16:08:49
 6
question number four.
16:08:50
 7
So, again, I'm not going to go back over the
16:08:52
 8
evidence that Mr. McCarter has already talked with you
16:08:54
 9
about.  For the reasons he discussed, you shouldn't even
16:08:57
get to this question.  You should answer no to the first
16:09:02
three questions.
16:09:03
But if you get here, this is where you'll have to
16:09:06
decide if cigarettes made by my client, Reynolds, were a
16:09:09
legal cause of Miss Davis' COPD.
16:09:11
Now, as you know, plaintiff has the burden to
16:09:15
prove that smoking my client's cigarettes legally caused or
16:09:18
substantially contributed to Mrs. Davis' COPD.
16:09:22
So listen for that language in Judge Rakoff's
16:09:25
instructions.  A moment ago, you heard from plaintiff's
16:09:30
counsel, and I believe that he said that the essential part
16:09:33
of this question is whether or not Miss Davis smoked any
16:09:38
cigarettes made by Reynolds or Philip Morris.
16:09:40
And I'd ask you to pay close attention to Judge
16:09:45
Rakoff's instructions when he gives them to you.  And when
16:09:49
you go back in the jury room, look at those instructions,
   225
16:09:51
 1
and I think you'll find that more proof is required than
16:09:54
 2
plaintiff insinuated.
16:09:56
 3
So based on the limited evidence that plaintiff
16:09:57
 4
brought you, you cannot fairly conclude that smoking
16:10:01
 5
Reynolds cigarettes was a substantial contribution to her
16:10:04
 6
COPD.
16:10:04
 7
Now, I would like to offer you a way to think
16:10:07
 8
about whether something is a substantial contribution.
16:10:13
 9
I'm a coffee person, so I'm going to use that as
16:10:16
an example.  So imagine that you and a friend decide that
16:10:19
you really, really want a cup of coffee.  And only the best
16:10:23
will do.  So where are you going to go, other than Seattle,
16:10:28
Washington, to get the best cup of coffee you can?
16:10:32
So you start your road trip.  Your friend starts
16:10:35
driving.  Things are going pretty smoothly.  And about an
16:10:37
hour in, your friend decides that she's tired of driving
16:10:40
and she asks you to drive.
16:10:42
Now, this is a 55-hour trip from Ocala, Florida,
16:10:50
to Seattle, Washington.  So do you know how far that you've
16:10:53
gotten into this 55-hour trip when your friend tells you
16:10:56
that she's tired of driving?
16:10:58
You've gotten to just a little bit north of
16:11:00
Gainesville if you left from Ocala.  That's not even to the
16:11:03
Florida-Georgia line.
16:11:05
You're still going to have to drive through
   226
16:11:07
 1
Florida, through Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri, all the way
16:11:10
 2
up Iowa/Nebraska border, across South Dakota, across
16:11:15
 3
Montana, through Idaho.  And then you're finally going to
16:11:19
 4
go through Washington until you finally get to Seattle, and
16:11:22
 5
you finally get your delicious cup of coffee.
16:11:25
 6
Now, would you say that your friend who stopped
16:11:27
 7
driving 54 hours ago when you were only an hour away from
16:11:30
 8
Ocala substantially contributed to driving this trip?  I
16:11:35
 9
would suggest no.
16:11:36
The same is true here.  At most, Reynolds'
16:11:40
contribution in this case is no greater than the friend's
16:11:45
contribution in the cross-country road trip in my example.
16:11:48
The one year that Miss Davis smoked Reynolds
16:11:51
cigarettes out of the 55 years that she smoked was not a
16:11:54
substantial contribution to her developing COPD.
16:11:57
And there's another question on the verdict form
16:11:59
where you should consider the limited amount of Reynolds
16:12:03
brands that Miss Davis smoked, and that's going to be --
16:12:09
Will you pull up the next slide, please?
16:12:11
It's going to be on question number five.
16:12:16
So the evidence will show -- or with everything
16:12:18
that Mr. McCarter has already talked with you about, those
16:12:21
reasons are going to apply equally to Reynolds.
16:12:24
But for an additional reason, Reynolds should have
16:12:27
zero responsibility.  And that is because of the limited
   227
16:12:29
 1
amount that she smoked.  And for the additional reason that
16:12:32
 2
you heard from Dr. Burns, that if she had quit smoking
16:12:36
 3
before she ever developed any lung decline, which is when
16:12:39
 4
she would have been smoking Reynolds cigarettes, she would
16:12:42
 5
not have gotten COPD.
16:12:44
 6
MR. BYRD:  Objection, Your Honor.  Same objection
16:12:47
 7
you said we'd discuss --
16:12:48
 8
THE COURT:  All right.
16:12:51
 9
MR. BYRD:  -- after summation.
16:12:53
THE COURT:  Go ahead.
16:12:55
MS. PATTERSON:  Now, I want to move forward
16:12:56
quickly to some other questions on the verdict form.  And
16:12:58
Mr. McCarter and I agree that you shouldn't even get to
16:13:01
these questions.
16:13:01
But if you do, I would like to ask you to focus on
16:13:05
one word, and that word is relied.
16:13:07
Now, this key word relied is going to be in Judge
16:13:12
Rakoff's instructions.  So listen to those and then look
16:13:15
for it on the jury instructions when you go back to the
16:13:18
jury room.
16:13:18
The judge's instructions require you -- or require
16:13:21
plaintiff to prove to you that plaintiff relied on
16:13:23
something that Reynolds said or did.  It had to make
16:13:27
Miss Davis take some kind of action.  And it's only about
16:13:31
Miss Davis, not someone else.
   228
16:13:32
 1
That Miss Davis got COPD because she relied on
16:13:36
 2
something that Reynolds said or did.  And Miss Davis simply
16:13:41
 3
hasn't proven this.
16:13:42
 4
Now, first, there's no evidence that Miss Davis
16:13:44
 5
ever heard or read any statement from a tobacco company.
16:13:49
 6
None of the advertisements or tobacco companies' statements
16:13:52
 7
that plaintiff's counsel showed you had anything to do with
16:13:55
 8
the choices that Miss Davis made.
16:13:57
 9
So let's talk for a minute about the evidence that
16:13:59
plaintiff did bring you.  You heard from Dr. Kyriakoudes,
16:14:01
who knew nothing about Miss Davis.  
16:14:04
In fact, he told you himself that his opinion was
16:14:06
not specific to Miss Davis in any way.  He showed you
16:14:10
advertisements that were from before she was born and for
16:14:13
brands that she never smoked.
16:14:15
Maybe you'll remember the Flintstone ad that
16:14:17
advertised Winston cigarettes.  She didn't watch
16:14:21
Flintstones.  She didn't smoke Winstons.  You didn't hear
16:14:25
that from plaintiff.
16:14:26
And Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns showed you various
16:14:29
documents and statements from tobacco companies, but
16:14:31
neither one of them said that Miss Davis heard or saw, much
16:14:35
less relied on, any of those.
16:14:37
And remember relied is the key word that you're
16:14:39
looking for.
   229
16:14:40
 1
In fact, many of the documents and the video clips
16:14:43
 2
that plaintiff's lawyer showed you were well after
16:14:47
 3
Miss Davis stopped smoking or puffing Reynolds cigarettes.
16:14:50
 4
For example, you were shown an advertisement in
16:14:54
 5
the "New York Times."  It was called, Can We Have an Open
16:14:58
 6
Debate About Smoking?
16:14:59
 7
You didn't hear any evidence that Miss Davis read
16:15:01
 8
the "New York Times."  And you didn't hear any evidence
16:15:04
 9
that she saw this article.
16:15:05
And this was at least 20 years after she had
16:15:08
stopped smoking Reynolds cigarettes.
16:15:11
The same thing happened when they showed you a
16:15:14
snippet of Congressional testimony in 1994.  You didn't
16:15:17
hear that Miss Davis ever heard that testimony.  And this
16:15:19
was at least 30 years after she had stopped smoking
16:15:22
Reynolds cigarettes.
16:15:24
So who is the one who could have told you whether
16:15:26
she relied?  It's Miss Davis herself.
16:15:29
So what did Miss Davis say about whether she
16:15:31
relied?  She said she didn't hear or read any statement
16:15:35
from a tobacco company.  
16:15:37
MR. BYRD:  Objection, Your Honor.  Misstates
16:15:40
testimony about statement from a person or --
16:15:45
THE COURT:  Yeah, I think -- I do think that's an
16:15:47
overstatement on counsel's part.  But the jury's
   230
16:15:49
 1
recollection will recall.  But I think the evidence was not
16:15:58
 2
quite as unequivocal as counsel remembers.  But we'll let
16:16:02
 3
the jury decide.
16:16:04
 4
MS. PATTERSON:  She also said that she didn't
16:16:05
 5
start smoking because of an advertisement.  In fact, the
16:16:09
 6
evidence was quite the opposite.
16:16:10
 7
She said she started smoking because her brother,
16:16:13
 8
her older brother, gave her cigarettes.  And she told you
16:16:16
 9
that she never bought a brand of cigarettes based on an
16:16:20
advertisement.
16:16:21
You saw some Camel advertisements yesterday.  But
16:16:24
none of those Camel advertisements impacted her brain
16:16:27
choice.  And that's because she was already smoking Camel.
16:16:30
So something that she saw after she already began
16:16:33
smoking a brand could not have influenced her decision to
16:16:35
start.
16:16:36
So plaintiff's theory is that Reynolds has -- if
16:16:41
Reynolds had said something publicly that was in its
16:16:44
internal documents, that that would have somehow made a
16:16:46
difference to Miss Davis.  But the story just doesn't add
16:16:49
up.
16:16:51
Miss Davis is the type of person who, when her
16:16:53
friends and her family members would urge her to quit, she
16:16:56
would say, leave me alone.  And she would say, I'll quit
16:17:03
when I get ready.  She said she loved smoking.  That's the
   231
16:17:06
 1
type of person that Miss Davis is.
16:17:08
 2
For these reasons, you should mark no to question
16:17:10
 3
number six and question number eight.  Because no reliance
16:17:15
 4
means no liability.
16:17:21
 5
Now, there's also one additional reason I'd like
16:17:25
 6
to talk to you about there.  And Mr. Byrd and plaintiff's
16:17:27
 7
experts spent a great deal of time talking with you about
16:17:31
 8
filtered cigarettes.
16:17:32
 9
And I'm not going to spend any time talking about
16:17:33
that for one simple reason, and that's because Miss Davis
16:17:37
never smoked a single cigarette that was filtered by my
16:17:40
client.  She never smoked one filtered Reynolds brand.
16:17:44
Both the Camel and the Pall Mall cigarettes that
16:17:46
she smoked were unfiltered.
16:17:48
Now, Mr. Byrd has suggested an award of an
16:17:55
enormous amount of money against my client, Reynolds,
16:17:57
despite the fact Miss Davis only smoked a Reynolds product
16:18:02
about a year out of a 55-year smoking history.
16:18:06
My client shouldn't pay any money for the limited
16:18:08
amount of smoking history.  You should not award Miss Davis
16:18:13
any money from Reynolds based on these facts that you've
16:18:16
heard in this case.
16:18:17
Reynolds did not substantially contribute to
16:18:20
Mrs. Davis' COPD.  And if she had chosen to quit smoking
16:18:24
cigarettes altogether when she stopped smoking Reynolds
   232
16:18:27
 1
brand, she wouldn't have COPD today.
16:18:29
 2
So for all the reasons that Mr. McCarter talked
16:18:31
 3
with you about, and that I talked with you about, I'm
16:18:34
 4
asking you to return a defense verdict in favor of R.J.
16:18:40
 5
Reynolds.
16:18:40
 6
Thank you very much for your service and for your
16:18:42
 7
attention.
