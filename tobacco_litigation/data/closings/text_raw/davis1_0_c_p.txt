CLOSING ARGUMENT BY THE PLAINTIFF 
13:15:19
MR. BYRD:  Good afternoon, everybody.  And we
13:15:20
thank you for your time.  It's not much longer now.  And we
13:15:23
appreciate all the listening that you've done.
13:15:27
We know we gave you a lot of evidence, a lot of
13:15:30
materials.  And I want to explain to you for a little bit
13:15:32
why I think it's all relevant and why I think it plays into
13:15:35
your decision making.
13:15:36
So I hope -- I said at the beginning of this trial
13:15:40
that I thought that by the time this trial was over that
13:15:43
everyone would have learned something they didn't know
13:15:47
about cigarettes and about this history of cigarettes that
13:15:50
everybody sort of has ideas about and think they know
   102
13:15:53
 1
about, but maybe they haven't seen all this material.
13:15:56
 2
And I promised you that we would see some
13:15:58
 3
documents that not a lot of people have seen.  And, of
13:16:02
 4
course, we couldn't bring you ten courtrooms full of
13:16:06
 5
documents.  We'd be here for a year to do that.  But we
13:16:10
 6
tried to bring you samples and examples.
13:16:13
 7
And that's why, I hope you remember, our experts
13:16:16
 8
testified several times that there were -- you know, I
13:16:19
 9
would ask them about an example.  They would say there are
13:16:22
hundreds of examples like this.
13:16:24
So there's plenty more evidence in the record that
13:16:26
we didn't have time to bring you, but that we tried to pick
13:16:29
out some of the most -- the ones that were the good
13:16:32
examples of that.
13:16:34
In a little bit this afternoon, but probably more
13:16:38
likely tomorrow given our timing, you're going to begin the
13:16:40
real hard work in this case.  And that's your
13:16:44
deliberations.  And nothing could be more important.
13:16:47
Miss Davis is truly proud, and I'm proud to be
13:16:51
here on her behalf, and her team, to get her day in court
13:16:54
and present her case to you.
13:16:55
And when you do those deliberations, you know,
13:17:01
they're not easy.  But they're important.  This is a --
13:17:05
this is a hugely important case.
13:17:08
MR. McCARTER:  Objection.
   103
13:17:12
 1
THE COURT:  Overruled.
13:17:15
 2
MR. BYRD:  And when, you know -- we have people
13:17:18
 3
say all the time, there's three branches of Government:
13:17:20
 4
There's the executive, the congressional.  We've heard
13:17:23
 5
different things from the Surgeon General's office, from
13:17:28
 6
Congress, and things like that.
13:17:29
 7
And then there's the third branch, which is this
13:17:31
 8
branch, the judicial branch.  And in our country, the
13:17:33
 9
judge, at least in this case, the judge doesn't make the
13:17:36
decision here.  You are.  You're the judge.  You're the
13:17:39
third branch.  You are the third branch of government today
13:17:42
for Miss Davis and for the defendants, to make the
13:17:47
determinations about this case and the years and years of
13:17:50
history that we've tried to show you.
13:17:51
And so when you -- the judge will instruct you on
13:17:57
the law.  I'm going to give you my interpretation of that.
13:18:00
But obviously if there's ever anything that I pass over or
13:18:03
go too quick or I say something a little bit differently
13:18:07
than it was, we're going to try to show you what his
13:18:08
instructions are.  The judge rules.  The judge is the final
13:18:10
word on what the law is.
13:18:11
And I say that because it's important.  And, John,
13:18:14
if you can put up the instructions.
13:18:17
In this case, when you deliberate -- and you made
13:18:24
this vow when you came to court the first day.  I don't
   104
13:18:27
 1
know if you remember, but the judge asked several questions
13:18:29
 2
of you all, about whether you could put aside biases, to
13:18:33
 3
make sure that we get a fair day in trial.
13:18:35
 4
And all of you swore that, you know, you can put
13:18:37
 5
anything aside.  You can come in here.  You know, if you
13:18:40
 6
get back in the jury room and you think you're doing
13:18:45
 7
deliberations and somebody starts bringing in biases, you
13:18:48
 8
know, they don't believe people should be -- get to file
13:18:51
 9
lawsuits like that, that this is wrong, things like that
13:18:54
that you know the judge has already said you're supposed to
13:18:56
leave at the door, I hope you remind them.
13:18:58
There's a jury instruction --
13:19:00
Can you show us?  Can you zoom in on that?
13:19:03
-- that regardless of the law, it is your sworn
13:19:06
duty to follow the law as I give it to you.
13:19:08
I, meaning the Court.  That's his instructions.
13:19:11
It's going to be his instructions.
13:19:12
And you can point them back, that the way we make
13:19:14
our decisions in a court of law, and in this case, no
13:19:17
matter what your biases are, is with the jury instructions.
13:19:20
And you have to follow just those and nothing else.
13:19:23
And if somebody is unable to do that, that's
13:19:26
something that the judge will instruct you how to do this,
13:19:28
how you can bring it to the Court's attention.
13:19:31
And so we hope you use the jury instructions as a
   105
13:19:35
 1
guidebook.  It is the guidebook for you to deliberate.  And
13:19:38
 2
nothing -- you can't consider anything outside what that
13:19:41
 3
guidebook permits you to consider.
13:19:44
 4
And so we appreciate you doing what you said you
13:19:47
 5
could do to give us, everybody, a fair shake.  Not just
13:19:51
 6
Miss Davis, but the tobacco companies, too, to be fair.
13:19:55
 7
Now, when I first came, I said that we had come to
13:19:58
 8
sue Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds for a few reasons.
13:20:01
 9
Just briefly, I had mentioned that, you know, because we
13:20:03
thought that it's wrong when a company hides -- knows about
13:20:08
a danger and doesn't tell its customers about it, in its
13:20:11
product.
13:20:12
And we said that, you know, it's wrong for the --
13:20:15
for companies to needlessly endanger the public, and that
13:20:20
it was wrong for them to conceal information it knows about
13:20:23
its product.  We don't think any company should be able to
13:20:26
do that.
13:20:27
And that we thought it was especially wrong for a
13:20:30
company, in any setting, to understand the dangers and
13:20:34
vulnerabilities of a product that they've hidden and then
13:20:40
make them even more addictive or harder to quit to the
13:20:43
public.
13:20:43
And then, finally, we were here because, taking
13:20:47
all that into account, it seemed especially wrong and is
13:20:51
wrong for a company to then target that type of product to
   106
13:20:56
 1
children, and to use and manipulate their knowledge, their
13:21:01
 2
superior knowledge of their product, of their own product,
13:21:04
 3
to get children hooked on what they know was a dangerous
13:21:07
 4
product.
13:21:07
 5
And I told you you had to take yourself back in
13:21:11
 6
time in this case.  And I hope you have.  We tried -- we
13:21:15
 7
played you a lot of videos.  I'm sure some of it gets
13:21:18
 8
boring and old.  But we had to show you about a different
13:21:21
 9
time and a different -- and different culture and different
13:21:24
era in American history.
13:21:27
And I'll get into this in just a little bit, but I
13:21:31
hope you realize, I hope you got the idea that there was a
13:21:35
time when things like lung cancer, COPD, they didn't exist.
13:21:40
In the early 1900s, they just didn't exist.  It
13:21:44
was the rarest form of disease and types of disease you
13:21:47
could see.  And something happened.  Okay?
13:21:49
And so we showed you the chart.  The consumption
13:21:51
of cigarettes go out of control, and 20 years later, these
13:21:54
diseases -- or it's an epidemic.  It's an epidemic.
13:21:58
This didn't just happen out of the blue.  This
13:22:02
didn't just come out of nowhere.
13:22:04
And you had to understand the culture.  You have
13:22:06
to judge this case -- you have to judge this case by not
13:22:10
just what Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds did or what
13:22:15
Miss Davis did, but you have to go back and judge it at the
   107
13:22:17
 1
appropriate time of what was known and the appropriate time
13:22:22
 2
in their life of what they did.
13:22:24
 3
You know, Miss Davis, when she was ten years old
13:22:27
 4
wasn't sitting in the boardroom of the largest companies in
13:22:32
 5
the world, cigarette companies.  She wasn't sitting in
13:22:36
 6
there.
13:22:36
 7
And you have to make that determination and judge
13:22:39
 8
about when -- you're going to look at comparative fault.
13:22:41
 9
We'll get there in a minute.  The fault of both sides.
13:22:44
That's one thing you're going to look at.  It's
13:22:46
going to be, I'm sure, something that's very important in
13:22:48
your deliberations to look at both sides of that equation.
13:22:50
She wasn't sitting in a boardroom.  But the
13:22:53
cigarette companies had a boardroom, and they were making
13:22:56
decisions during that time.  And you have to look at those
13:22:59
decisions versus ten-year-old Evonne Davis.
13:23:03
What she was doing at the time, she was under a
13:23:03
board.  If you remember her testifying, she was under her
13:23:06
house board as a ten-year-old smoking cigarettes.  That was
13:23:14
her perspective, looking up at a board, the cigarette smoke
13:23:15
going into her mom's house.  That's how she started.
13:23:17
Maybe eight years old when she was starting to
13:23:20
puff.  And then ten, eleven is when it started becoming
13:23:23
routine, regular, every day.  Half pack, and then grew.
13:23:27
Now, the judge is going to instruct you, but let's
   108
13:23:29
 1
talk about a couple things in the instructions.
13:23:33
 2
John, if you could bring up the instructions on
13:23:36
 3
burden of proof.
13:23:36
 4
The judge has talked briefly about this, but I
13:23:38
 5
want to point it out.  The judge is going to instruct you
13:23:41
 6
what our burden of proof is.  And he's already told you
13:23:43
 7
this isn't a criminal case.  This is not beyond all
13:23:46
 8
reasonable doubt.
13:23:46
 9
And I want to be really clear about that, because
13:23:48
if you get into the jury room and somebody says, you know,
13:23:50
I have some doubt.  I didn't think that was whatever.  I
13:23:53
have a little doubt here whether she actually did X or saw
13:23:57
X, whatever it is.  You can have doubt in a case like this.
13:24:00
We are in a different standard.
13:24:02
You have to apply these rules.  And you can have
13:24:05
some doubt.  And if somebody says, I have a little doubt,
13:24:08
you know, please remind them, well, let's look at what the
13:24:10
jury instruction says.
13:24:11
Obviously we can't bring this up.  We don't have
13:24:14
it on a screen, but it says, to establish an element of a
13:24:20
claim by preponderance of the evidence, that's the standard
13:24:23
-- preponderance of the credible evidence means to prove
13:24:26
that the element is more likely true than not true.
13:24:29
Okay.  It's just more likely true than not true.
13:24:33
I'll give an example.  You know, it's like the scales, the
   109
13:24:37
 1
scales of justice.  If it tilts just ever so slightly in
13:24:40
 2
our favor, you have to find in our favor.  That's how civil
13:24:43
 3
cases work.  That's how this law works.
13:24:45
 4
You know, it's maybe a poor analogy, but, you
13:24:49
 5
know, you have to bet all the money in the world that you
13:24:51
 6
have on one thing.  You can either choose A or B.  You bet
13:24:56
 7
all the money in the world on A or B, okay, with the
13:24:59
 8
evidence you have.  Which one are you going to go with?
13:25:02
 9
It's just what's more likely true than not true.
13:25:04
Now -- and you have to pick.  You have to pick one
13:25:10
side or the other.  You've got to do the one that is just
13:25:13
-- which one has tipped the scales ever so slightly.
13:25:17
Now, the first question -- actually, it's not the
13:25:22
first question.  The first question you're going to be
13:25:23
asked is about manifestation.
13:25:25
You've heard about that, about when did her
13:25:27
symptoms, her symptoms of COPD, first arise, and was it
13:25:32
before November of 1996.
13:25:34
Okay.  And there's a reason for that date that,
13:25:36
you know, you don't need to worry about.  But the main
13:25:39
reason is was it before November 21, 1996.
13:25:42
And I'll get to that point in a minute.  Okay.
13:25:44
But I want to go to a couple of other questions
13:25:46
that are going to determine whether Miss Davis receives the
13:25:49
benefit of what we've been talking about, some of the Engle
   110
13:25:52
 1
findings.
13:25:53
 2
Okay.  The Engle findings are critical to this
13:25:55
 3
case.  The judge is going to instruct you what they are.
13:25:59
 4
But they don't mean anything, they don't mean anything
13:26:01
 5
unless Miss Davis proves that she is entitled to receive
13:26:06
 6
their benefit.
13:26:07
 7
We refer to it as a member of the class, a member
13:26:10
 8
of the Engle class.  If she proves these things -- and
13:26:14
 9
we're going to go over those questions -- then she gets the
13:26:16
benefit of those findings.  And when she gets the benefit
13:26:20
of those findings, you have to apply them.  It's the law.
13:26:22
You can't question or speculate as to anything
13:26:24
about them, or whether you agree with them or somebody
13:26:28
disagrees with them.
13:26:29
You need to remind them or even tell the Court if
13:26:31
you have to, that once she receives the benefits of the
13:26:34
findings, they cannot be questioned.  You have to apply
13:26:37
them.  That's the way this case works under the law.
13:26:39
So let's look at -- the first question I'd like to
13:26:43
look at, it will be on your verdict form here -- if you can
13:26:46
show, John -- it will be whether it's more likely than not
13:26:50
that Miss Davis was addicted to cigarettes containing
13:26:54
nicotine, okay?
13:26:55
Now, it will actually be question two.  As I said,
13:26:57
I'm going to get to the manifestation question later.  That
   111
13:27:01
 1
will be question one.
13:27:03
 2
Question two will be, we, the jury, find that the
13:27:05
 3
plaintiff has proved that it is more likely than not that
13:27:08
 4
Miss Davis was addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes.
13:27:10
 5
Okay?
13:27:12
 6
Now, what was the evidence -- remember, we just
13:27:14
 7
have to show more likely than not.  What was the
13:27:17
 8
evidence --
13:27:17
 9
And actually, can you just pull this up so they
13:27:20
can see it?  Slide part one.
13:27:26
Remember, this is the standard we looked at.  It
13:27:27
was, to establish a claim by a preponderance of the
13:27:29
evidence means to prove something is more likely true than
13:27:32
not true.
13:27:33
And then let's talk about what it means to be
13:27:35
addicted.  The judge is going to give you an instruction on
13:27:38
what addiction means.
13:27:40
Jeff, can we bring up this slide, four?
13:27:44
Now, this is the definition that the judge is
13:27:46
going to instruct you on.  A compulsive need for and use of
13:27:52
a habit-forming substance, characterized by tolerance and
13:27:56
by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal.
13:28:00
That's the definition of addiction.
13:28:01
And you heard first from Dr. Burns.  And Dr. Burns
13:28:04
is -- was a medical doctor, you know, in the Surgeon
   112
13:28:08
 1
General's office dealing with tobacco matters and smoking
13:28:11
 2
and health before any litigation ever happened.  Years and
13:28:14
 3
years before he ever worked in litigation, he was an expert
13:28:17
 4
in this field of smoking and health and worked in the
13:28:19
 5
Surgeon General's office and -- and helped contribute to
13:28:25
 6
all the reports.
13:28:26
 7
And, you know, those reports -- we're going to
13:28:28
 8
show you some things from those reports.  But the thing
13:28:30
 9
about those reports is, they are the truth.  They speak the
13:28:36
truth about science on smoking and health.
13:28:38
And if there's any doubt, we'll show you some of
13:28:41
these.  This is one.  This is the 2010 Surgeon General's
13:28:45
report.  Okay?  And on our side, with Miss Davis, we stand
13:28:48
with the Surgeon General of the United States.  And when
13:28:51
you look at these reports, that's where we are.  That's
13:28:54
where we stand.
13:28:55
And we're going to talk a little bit -- in a
13:28:57
little bit about where Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds
13:29:00
stood over the years and even currently with the Surgeon
13:29:03
General's office of the United States and their findings.
13:29:05
And it is a stark difference that we want you to
13:29:08
understand.
13:29:08
But on addiction, have we proved that it's more
13:29:11
likely right than wrong or more likely than not that she
13:29:16
was addicted?  Dr. Burns came in and he talked about how
   113
13:29:18
 1
changes in the brain happen.  Your brain is changed
13:29:21
 2
forever.
13:29:23
 3
That children and young people, the younger you
13:29:25
 4
start, that your brain is still forming, and that that has
13:29:28
 5
all the more reason why nicotine can take its hold on you
13:29:31
 6
and get a hold on you.
13:29:32
 7
And it's a predictor how young you smoke, how
13:29:35
 8
young you start smoking, about whether you'll be able to
13:29:38
 9
quit or not, and how hard it will be for you to quit down
13:29:41
the road.
13:29:42
And Dr. Burns explained to you that nicotine comes
13:29:44
into the lungs.  And, you know, we're created in this --
13:29:49
this goes to the second and third question really,
13:29:51
addiction, whether she was addicted, but whether the
13:29:54
addiction caused the disease.
13:29:56
You know, Dr. Burns described about the lungs.
13:29:58
And, you know, when you think about it, we're made in an
13:30:02
amazing way.  We're created in a special, special way.
13:30:06
We have these lungs.  And he drew them for you.
13:30:11
Remember, he -- you know, he drew kind of how the lungs
13:30:14
work and everything that spreads out.
13:30:16
And what he told you was, when you spread -- it's
13:30:18
like a tree.  It's like the leaves on a tree.  When you
13:30:21
spread all that out, if you opened up all the airways where
13:30:25
air can get in your lungs, you just put it all out.  It's
   114
13:30:25
 1
as big as a tennis court.  That's how we're made.
13:30:28
 2
And that's what Dr. Burns told you.  If you spread
13:30:31
 3
it all out, he said it was as big as a tennis court.  He
13:30:35
 4
meant that literally.  It's like if you imagine a tree in a
13:30:37
 5
park, all of those branches are going out in your organs,
13:30:40
 6
you take those leaves, you spread it out, you can cover a
13:30:43
 7
tennis court.
13:30:43
 8
That's the surface area that the cigarette smoke
13:30:47
 9
is hitting.  Okay?  And when the cigarette smoke goes in,
13:30:51
okay, what else -- what other defense mechanisms do we have
13:30:56
that we're created with when we're born?
13:30:58
Okay.  Miss Davis, she was born 1940, had the same
13:31:01
thing we all do.  We have these cilia in the lungs.  You
13:31:06
remember Dr. Burns talked about cigarettes come in, and
13:31:09
they freeze that.  Okay?  They freeze the cilia.
13:31:12
So even on the first cigarette, even on the first
13:31:15
cigarette Miss Davis ever had, which was, you know, Camel
13:31:18
cigarettes, which is an R.J. Reynolds product, you heard,
13:31:23
and she smoked some Marlboros, too.  She smoked Camels for
13:31:27
quite a while in the early years.  Those are the formative
13:31:30
years.
13:31:30
You're going to hear some -- in a little bit,
13:31:30
we'll get to this.  You're going to hear some statements,
13:31:33
I'm sure, from R.J. Reynolds' counsel, who you haven't
13:31:35
heard a lot from, but I've got to tell you, they're here
   115
13:31:38
 1
for a very serious reason.
13:31:40
 2
And it's serious because those are the cigarettes
13:31:44
 3
that really start forming the addiction in a young child.
13:31:48
 4
And those are the -- while your brain is still forming.
13:31:52
 5
And they are among the most cigarettes that she smoked.
13:31:55
 6
And they're also here for some very serious
13:31:58
 7
reasons about what they did in conjunction and in
13:32:00
 8
coordination and in agreement that we allege formed a
13:32:02
 9
conspiracy and was a conspiracy with Philip Morris and
13:32:06
other cigarette companies to do the things that are on this
13:32:10
timeline that we'll get into.
13:32:12
But those initial cigarettes are important.  And
13:32:15
Dr. Burns told you every cigarette, even from the first
13:32:18
cigarette, it freezes the -- every cigarette you smoke, it
13:32:20
freezes the cilia and damage starts to be done.
13:32:23
So then every time you smoke, these carcinogens,
13:32:27
these chemicals, these irritants are coming in and
13:32:29
irritating your lung.  Remember, he spent a long time
13:32:33
telling you about how that works.
13:32:34
And the cilia no longer can throw -- they can't
13:32:37
throw the irritants out.  And it just starts gathering and
13:32:41
gathering and gathering.
13:32:42
And the mechanisms that we're made with to stop
13:32:44
this from ever happening that never happened back before
13:32:47
the 1920s, '30s because we didn't have cigarettes, those
   116
13:32:51
 1
mechanisms break down, and people die.  And people get
13:32:54
 2
diseases and fatal diseases.
13:32:55
 3
So you heard Dr. Burns talk about how that works.
13:32:59
 4
And then you heard Dr. Cummings mention that the cigarette
13:33:03
 5
companies had mastered that they can get it down -- you
13:33:05
 6
know, nicotine gets into your blood, goes into the lung,
13:33:08
 7
deep inhalation, seven to ten seconds it hits your brain.
13:33:14
 8
And when it hits your brain, it goes to these
13:33:15
 9
nicotine receptors.  And these nicotine receptors grow and
13:33:18
grow and grow, and they change your brain permanently.
13:33:21
The nicotine receptors grow, and come and go,
13:33:24
depending on the smoke; but the pathways that have been
13:33:27
created, the physical pathways that have been created with
13:33:30
those receptors, never leave your brain.
13:33:32
Dr. Burns testified we know this because they've
13:33:35
done studies and studies on the brain.  Modern studies that
13:33:39
show us that.
13:33:40
So what do you have?  They talked about compulsive
13:33:43
need for use.  You heard that from Dr. Burns, and you heard
13:33:46
that from Dr. Cummings.  They talked about it's a
13:33:49
habit-forming substance.
13:33:51
They talked about tolerance.  You remember
13:33:54
Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings talked about this concept of
13:33:55
when you start, you know, you maybe start at a half a pack
13:33:57
like she did, and you grow and you grow and you grow
   117
13:34:00
 1
because your body is building up a tolerance and you need
13:34:03
 2
that much more until you get to that level that really
13:34:05
 3
feeds your addiction.  And then physiological symptoms upon
13:34:09
 4
withdrawal.
13:34:09
 5
And what did Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings say that
13:34:13
 6
then Miss Davis came on the stand and supported as well?
13:34:16
 7
When she tried to quit, she'd get jittery.  She'd
13:34:19
 8
get nervous.  She'd get agitated.  She'd get angry.  A
13:34:21
 9
little bit upset to be around.
13:34:24
And those are all classic defined withdrawal
13:34:26
symptoms that Dr. Cummings told you about, that Dr. Burns
13:34:28
mentioned to you.  And she had them.  It was throughout the
13:34:33
records.
13:34:33
And so let's look at some of the evidence about
13:34:38
addiction.  I told you, remember, just more likely than
13:34:42
not.
13:34:43
Can you bring this up, Jeff?
13:34:45
So we have the scales of justice here that I put
13:34:48
on about, you know, what is the evidence in this case,
13:34:50
okay, that you're looking at, that you're going to look at
13:34:53
to make your determination from plaintiff, Evonne Davis.
13:34:57
And then we have on the other side for the
13:34:59
defendants, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.
13:35:01
And let's look at -- you have Dr. Burns, okay?
13:35:11
We brought you Dr. Burns, and it tips the scales
   118
13:35:13
 1
ever so slightly.  He read the records.  He read all of the
13:35:16
 2
medical records, by the way.
13:35:17
 3
I know there was some suggestion about, you know,
13:35:20
 4
Dr. Cummings was cross the other day about we hadn't given
13:35:22
 5
him all the medical records.  And that's true, we hadn't
13:35:24
 6
given him all the medical records.  That's our bad.
13:35:27
 7
But the medical records he had not been provided,
13:35:29
 8
the only ones they showed him that he hadn't been provided
13:35:33
 9
were after 19 -- were after her COPD when it said half a
13:35:36
pack, half a pack.
13:35:38
And he had plenty of medical records -- he did
13:35:38
have a lot of those records that said half a pack a day,
13:35:41
half a pack a day.  But they tried to make this a big point
13:35:44
that we just didn't show all the records that said half a
13:35:46
pack a day.
13:35:46
And they made a point that, oh, she wasn't
13:35:48
receptive to quitting.  Okay?  We'll talk about whether
13:35:50
that even comes into play in your determination at all or
13:35:54
not on these questions.  All right?
13:35:55
But Dr. Burns, he had all the medical records
13:35:58
because he's the medical doctor.  And we gave Dr. Burns
13:36:01
each and every one of the medical records.  And he saw
13:36:04
tobacco abuse in the records.  He saw tolerance.  He saw
13:36:08
the withdrawal symptoms in the records.  And he saw the
13:36:10
pack history that developed over that.
   119
13:36:12
 1
And he didn't stop there.  He read the
13:36:14
 2
depositions.  Okay?  He read the depositions of everybody
13:36:17
 3
in the case that Miss Davis -- and you heard -- there were
13:36:22
 4
some long depositions -- that defendants did to find out
13:36:25
 5
everything they could about Miss Davis.
13:36:27
 6
And he read those.  And he determined easily, he
13:36:31
 7
said, again, no doubt in his mind, no doubt in his mind,
13:36:36
 8
that she was addicted and heavily addicted.
13:36:37
 9
And then what else did we bring?  We brought
13:36:40
Dr. Cummings.  He came at it from a -- he's not a medical
13:36:42
doctor.  He came at it from a behavioral science
13:36:46
perspective.  He was more focused on the depositions and
13:36:49
what they said and the medical records as well to determine
13:36:51
pack-year history.  Okay?  But he got what he needed on the
13:36:53
pack-year history.
13:36:55
And we brought you Dr. Cummings, and that tips the
13:36:57
scales.  And, you know, they are going to -- the cigarette
13:37:00
companies are going to come up here and mention and
13:37:04
criticize that these people make money and they're in a war
13:37:07
against tobacco and, you know, they make all of this money.
13:37:10
And I submit to you, well, of course they do.
13:37:14
Because -- you heard them.  Dr. Cummings said he testified
13:37:18
once and thought he would never have to testify again in
13:37:20
the original Engle litigation, and did it pro bono.  He
13:37:24
didn't know it was going to be brought up in all of these
   120
13:37:26
 1
cases.  He's having to spend every day on this.
13:37:27
 2
But we brought you the best experts there are out
13:37:29
 3
there.  The best.  And we brought you -- remember, I told
13:37:32
 4
you there's only a handful of people -- and you heard that
13:37:35
 5
from Dr. Cummings.
13:37:36
 6
There's only a few people that have even been able
13:37:37
 7
to review these medical records in this kind of way.  He
13:37:41
 8
was the first -- Dr. Cummings was the first one to receive
13:37:44
 9
them, really.  You heard the New York Attorney General's
13:37:48
Office sent him the records.  He got them, and he had to
13:37:50
start the catalog for everybody else.
13:37:52
And Dr. Burns, he's worked with the Surgeon
13:37:55
General's office forever.  They are renowned experts.
13:37:58
Nothing -- the fact that they have to charge money for all
13:38:01
the time that they have to spend to give defendants their
13:38:04
depositions, to consult us, to advise, to review the
13:38:07
records does not take away from what they said.
13:38:09
And we'll get to it in a minute.  But, you know,
13:38:13
it does not take away from these documents over here.  They
13:38:16
say what they say.
13:38:17
I mean, if we had misrepresented something in
13:38:20
these documents, they would have brought somebody from
13:38:23
R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris to tell you that.  And they
13:38:25
didn't.
13:38:26
So we brought Dr. Cummings.
   121
13:38:28
 1
And then what else did we show you?  We brought
13:38:31
 2
Miss Davis.  Miss Davis came, and she was willing to come
13:38:35
 3
in here and sit on the stand and go through any question we
13:38:38
 4
wanted.  And she told us about when she started smoking,
13:38:41
 5
what she felt like, how much it was.
13:38:44
 6
And then she confirmed one of the largest things
13:38:46
 7
about this compulsive use, you know, despite harm, which
13:38:50
 8
they talk about.  She continued to smoke after she had
13:38:53
 9
COPD.  Okay?  After she had COPD, she kept smoking.
13:38:59
And so is the defendants' argument really, you
13:39:00
know, she had COPD.  She can't breathe.  Every doctor,
13:39:04
every time she goes in, is telling her she needs to quit,
13:39:07
she needs to quit.  And that she just -- she seriously just
13:39:12
kept doing it because she didn't give a crap.  I mean,
13:39:14
really?
13:39:15
She was trying -- she was trying to quit from '85
13:39:17
on.  The fact that she continued to smoke after a disease,
13:39:22
after something she knows is caused by smoking and hurting
13:39:25
her, you heard it from Dr. Burns, is a key indicator that
13:39:28
you are addicted.  
13:39:29
Because you're smoking compulsive use despite
13:39:32
harm.  Go back to the addiction definition.  It's plain
13:39:36
language, and it's what the judge will give you.
13:39:39
So we brought Miss Davis to testify.  And you
13:39:41
heard her testify about what she smoked, when she smoked,
   122
13:39:44
 1
how much.  It grew over time.  It got as much as two packs
13:39:48
 2
a day, or maybe more, maybe two and a half packs sometimes.
13:39:51
 3
And then she told you, after COPD, exactly what
13:39:53
 4
the records defendant showed, everyone confirms.  She was
13:39:57
 5
trying to cut back.  And she was using the Waterpik system
13:40:00
 6
starting in '85.  And she cut back and went down to a half
13:40:03
 7
a pack a day.  You saw that in the records.  That was her
13:40:07
 8
cutting down in those years after her COPD.
13:40:09
 9
But she couldn't stop it all the way.  That's what
13:40:12
she was trying to do.  But she couldn't stop it all the
13:40:14
way.  And she told you about one of those times when she
13:40:18
tried to quit, the symptoms of withdrawal that she had,
13:40:20
what she experienced.
13:40:21
And, finally, we brought you the 2010 Surgeon
13:40:27
General report.  Remember, that's the one that says
13:40:30
nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason.  Okay?
13:40:33
Now, we heard some -- I'll let you decide about
13:40:37
Mr. Jupe and Mr. Gentry.  We had to play long depositions
13:40:41
for you.  I apologize.  I apologize for long depositions.
13:40:43
But, you know, we kind of thought that we may not
13:40:46
hear from Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, and we needed to
13:40:48
bring you what they say currently.  And what they say
13:40:51
currently is they're still arguing with the Surgeon
13:40:54
General's office of the United States.
13:40:56
Oh, they'll tell you, we believe it's -- we
   123
13:40:58
 1
believe cigarettes are addictive.  And they'll tell you,
13:41:01
 2
well, smoking causes diseases.  And addiction causes people
13:41:05
 3
to smoke more.  Oh, but we won't say addiction caused
13:41:09
 4
disease.  We can't say that.  We're not going to say that.
13:41:11
 5
That's just wrong.
13:41:12
 6
Even though every public health authority says
13:41:15
 7
it's the number one issue that we have to deal with.  Why?
13:41:18
 8
Because most people would quit if they could.  Most smokers
13:41:21
 9
are addicted.
13:41:22
And nicotine, we showed you in this report right
13:41:24
here -- and by the way, the Surgeon General's report, at
13:41:29
least the ones we introduced, the 2010 Surgeon General's
13:41:31
report, it's going to be back in your deliberating room for
13:41:34
you to review.
13:41:35
Read it.  There's a great chapter.  It's Exhibit
13:41:37
237.  237.  It will be in your exhibits.  There's a great
13:41:42
chapter on nicotine addiction.
13:41:43
And if you glance at the summary -- and there's a
13:41:47
great chapter on the changing cigarette.  And if you look
13:41:50
at these chapters and review them, you can see what we're
13:41:54
talking about.
13:41:56
And, again, you take that as the truth that
13:42:01
nicotine addiction is the primary reason people smoke.  And
13:42:03
we brought you that.  And it was the reason Miss Davis was
13:42:06
smoking for all those years and throughout even when she
   124
13:42:09
 1
was sick and could, you know, barely breathe, with her
13:42:13
 2
shortness of breath and her COPD.
13:42:15
 3
And then we brought you the 2014 Surgeon General
13:42:19
 4
Consumer Guide.
13:42:20
 5
Actually, can we bring that up, that one page?
13:42:22
 6
And what are the 2014 -- modern science.  Okay?
13:42:33
 7
Now, the cigarette companies will challenge these things,
13:42:35
 8
but this is modern science.  The reality -- this is 2014.  
13:42:39
 9
The Surgeon General says, the reality is that
13:42:41
smoking is not usually a choice.  For most smokers, tobacco
13:42:45
use is an addiction, and nicotine is the primary drug in
13:42:49
tobacco that causes addiction.
13:42:51
And I -- there is no evidence brought by the
13:42:54
cigarette companies to challenge that piece of evidence.
13:42:56
Not one.
13:42:56
What is more likely right than wrong?  Do you have
13:43:00
to have -- have the scales been tipped ever so slightly?
13:43:04
And if so, you have to find in our favor that she was more
13:43:06
likely than not addicted.
13:43:08
And, finally, we brought you Miss Davis' medical
13:43:13
records.  Remember, they showed you the medical records
13:43:15
about whether she was receptive to quitting or not.
13:43:18
And, you know, if you have some questions about
13:43:19
how hard she tried to quit, whether she tried to quit
13:43:22
enough, should she have tried more, was she dedicated
   125
13:43:25
 1
enough or motivated enough to quit, I understand that.
13:43:28
 2
We're not here to tell you that Miss Davis has,
13:43:31
 3
you know, no blame whatsoever.  She's willing, at least for
13:43:37
 4
her part, on her side of this case, to stand up and accept
13:43:40
 5
some responsibility for her own choices, although she
13:43:43
 6
started when she was ten.  But she's willing to stand up
13:43:46
 7
for that.
13:43:47
 8
But the part -- the place for you to consider that
13:43:49
 9
is in what's called the comparative fault section, which we
13:43:52
get to when you weigh the fault of all the different
13:43:55
parties.  It's not an easy question.
13:43:57
Okay.  That's where we submit that you should make
13:43:59
that consideration about her motivation to quit and all
13:44:02
that.  That's in comparative fault.
13:44:04
And don't confuse those issues.
13:44:06
So we brought you the medical records.
13:44:09
Can we show the tobacco -- the October 7 record
13:44:13
that -- remember, defendants kept showing it to people up
13:44:16
here.  They kept pulling it out.
13:44:17
And they didn't highlight one portion of that
13:44:19
record.  They didn't highlight the portion that said
13:44:23
tobacco abuse.
13:44:23
From a doctor.  Her treating doctor.  Before any
13:44:29
litigation.  Before any lawsuits or anything like that.
13:44:32
Tobacco abuse.  Right there, from her own medical doctor,
   126
13:44:37
 1
made that own determination.  More likely right than wrong.
13:44:42
 2
Do we trust doctors?  Do we trust doctors who
13:44:44
 3
treat us?  Do you think they put these things in there
13:44:47
 4
willy-nilly?
13:44:48
 5
That's what they meant.  And, you know, what if
13:44:48
 6
the defendants said, we don't know what they meant by that.
13:44:52
 7
We don't know what that means?  That's going to be
13:44:55
 8
the argument?  We don't know what that means?
13:44:58
 9
So when you read the jury instructions, the jury
13:45:00
instructions are going to say use your common sense.  You
13:45:02
can make reasonable inferences.  Reasonable inferences.
13:45:05
I'm not asking you to do anything unreasonable here.
13:45:08
What's the reasonable inference?  Look at the jury
13:45:11
instructions.  What's the reasonable inference from that
13:45:14
alone?  Even if I hadn't brought -- even if we hadn't
13:45:17
brought any of the other evidence, that should do it right
13:45:19
there.
13:45:20
So we go back to our scales.
13:45:27
How am I doing on time?
13:45:31
MR. WALBURG:  Forty-nine left.
13:45:33
MR. BYRD:  When you go back to the scales, let's
13:45:35
see how it's tipped.  And we have to tip it ever so
13:45:39
slightly.  So if you're in the jury deliberation room and
13:45:42
somebody says, well, I have doubts about whether she's
13:45:44
addicted, well, press them.
   127
13:45:46
 1
On what?  Based on what?  All they have to prove,
13:45:49
 2
it's more likely right than wrong, more likely than not.
13:45:53
 3
They don't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
13:45:54
 4
And then what evidence did -- what evidence did
13:46:03
 5
defendants bring?  Okay.  One witness that they read.
13:46:07
 6
That's it.  One witness that they read, Miss Fran Craft.
13:46:13
 7
And you know, she said, well, you know, I never
13:46:15
 8
saw her try to quit.
13:46:16
 9
Didn't say anything about addiction.  You're not
13:46:18
going to see the word quit.  You're not going to see
13:46:21
whether -- you're not going to see if she could quit or not
13:46:24
or whether she tried hard to quit in the definition of
13:46:27
addiction.
13:46:27
And you have to use the judge's definition of
13:46:30
addiction.  Quitting isn't in there.
13:46:33
And so they brought Miss Craft by deposition.
13:46:37
They had someone come up here and act like she was
13:46:39
Miss Craft, to read it for you so you can read what she
13:46:43
said.
13:46:43
And the thing you've got to remember about
13:46:45
Miss Craft, she met her in '88.  Met her.  She testified,
13:46:50
what the deposition testimony said is that she didn't spend
13:46:52
any time with her meaningfully until 1998.
13:46:55
I'm sorry.  '99.  It was '99.  She said 1999.  But
13:47:00
by 1999, Miss Davis has COPD.  She's been trying the
   128
13:47:04
 1
Waterpik filter for years and years and years, and she's
13:47:07
 2
down to a half a pack.
13:47:08
 3
That's their evidence.  That's the only evidence
13:47:11
 4
they brought.  And if they thought that they could bring in
13:47:14
 5
here an addiction expert like Dr. Burns, a medical doctor,
13:47:19
 6
or a behavioral scientist expert like Dr. Cummings, if they
13:47:22
 7
had somebody that they could find to say that she was not
13:47:26
 8
addicted, they would have brought them in here and told
13:47:28
 9
you.  And they didn't.
13:47:34
Now, the second question is going to be whether
13:47:36
addiction caused the disease.  And Dr. Burns talked to you
13:47:41
about the fact -- and we've already gone over it.  It's the
13:47:44
repeated exposure to smoke.  Okay.  It's not just one
13:47:48
cigarette.  It's every cigarette that combines.
13:47:50
You can't pick out what years or times that it did
13:47:52
it.  It's every cigarette combines.  Why?  Every cigarette
13:47:56
-- for two reasons.  Because every cigarette --
13:47:59
You can take that down.
13:48:00
Every cigarette helps contribute to the addiction.
13:48:05
Okay?  And every cigarette contributes to stopping the
13:48:09
cilia, doing irritants and damage, and that it all leads up
13:48:13
over time to creating COPD.
13:48:15
And, John, if you can show the instructions real
13:48:17
quick on -- no, the instructions on addiction causation.
13:48:31
And the instruction says that her addiction was a
   129
13:48:35
 1
legal cause -- this is one of the things she has to show to
13:48:38
 2
get the benefit of the findings, that her addiction was a
13:48:41
 3
legal cause of her COPD in the sense that her continued
13:48:44
 4
smoking of cigarettes was, at least in part, a natural and
13:48:48
 5
direct result -- a natural and direct result of her
13:48:53
 6
addiction.
13:48:53
 7
And now, he goes on to explain in this regard,
13:48:58
 8
plaintiff need not prove that addiction was the only reason
13:49:00
 9
Miss Davis continued to smoke cigarettes.  She may, for
13:49:04
example, have partly smoked them because she enjoyed
13:49:08
smoking.
13:49:09
Okay.  So if somebody said, well, she enjoyed
13:49:12
smoking, I think she enjoyed smoking, that's fine.  We
13:49:15
explained all the reasons why smokers enjoy smoking and why
13:49:18
they say that.  Of course, they're going to enjoy smoking
13:49:21
if you're addicted.
13:49:22
But even if somebody said, well, I think she just
13:49:23
did it for enjoyment, no other reason, the judge has
13:49:27
instructed you, and you must follow them, that even if she
13:49:30
enjoyed smoking, that doesn't matter.  They can act in
13:49:34
concert and have more than one reason why she smoked them.
13:49:37
And as long as addiction was a substantive reason,
13:49:42
a substantial contributing reason -- and it was, because it
13:49:46
was the repeated exposure to the smoking cigarettes that
13:49:49
caused it -- then we've proved addiction.
   130
13:49:52
 1
And I submit to you I could line up the scales
13:49:54
 2
again.  And I won't do that.  All the evidence we brought.
13:49:57
 3
And what evidence did they bring?  Zero.  Zero.
13:50:04
 4
Where was the medical doctor to come in and say,
13:50:07
 5
you know, this was caused by something else?
13:50:11
 6
And, in fact, the judge is even going to instruct
13:50:13
 7
you -- it's somewhere different, but the judge is going to
13:50:17
 8
instruct you that neither party disputes, okay, cigarettes
13:50:20
 9
caused her disease.
13:50:21
And then Dr. Burns said 95 percent of COPD is
13:50:24
caused by smoking.  No one disputes that in this case.  It
13:50:27
is undisputed.  Cigarettes caused Mrs. Davis' COPD, end of
13:50:32
story.  It cannot even be questioned.
13:50:34
And so if cigarettes caused it, well, then what
13:50:37
caused her to keep smoking?
13:50:39
Addiction.
13:50:40
But addiction need not be the only cause.  It only
13:50:42
has to be a cause.  You can have other causes.  Because I'm
13:50:46
going to show you some other causes, too, where I think
13:50:49
some of their lies and concealments and their potential
13:50:51
things they did, they also contributed.
13:50:53
You can have more than one cause.  It just needs
13:50:55
to be a cause.  Just a cause.  And so the question, is it
13:50:58
more likely than not -- and remember, you know, make sure
13:51:02
the standard is followed when you all deliberate.
   131
13:51:04
 1
Is it more likely than not that addiction was a
13:51:08
 2
cause of her disease?
13:51:10
 3
We submit to you that it's not even a close call.
13:51:12
 4
And Dr. Burns said that, and everyone else backed
13:51:19
 5
that up.  And the medical records back that up as well.
13:51:22
 6
Now, the only other question that we need to show
13:51:26
 7
to become what's known as an Engle member and get the
13:51:29
 8
benefit of these findings is the manifestation question.
13:51:32
 9
And it will be your first question.
13:51:34
Did her disease manifest prior to November 1 --
13:51:37
November 21 of 1996?
13:51:38
And let me just say, you know, there are -- you
13:51:46
know, everyone would love to have medical records, you
13:51:50
know, somewhere between 1993, '94, '95, '96 in this case.
13:51:54
We'd love to have them.  They don't exist.  We don't have
13:51:57
them.
13:51:57
You know, any medical doctor she saw, those
13:52:01
records are gone.  Not by anybody's fault.  But they're
13:52:04
gone.  And nobody has them.  Neither side has them.
13:52:06
And so, you know, we're unable -- because it is so
13:52:10
long ago, to be able to show you those records.  But what
13:52:13
we can do is, the first record we do have, okay, is from
13:52:16
March of 1998.
13:52:18
And I'll show that.  This is the first record
13:52:22
that's available, related to COPD anyway, for either side.
   132
13:52:25
 1
All right?  
13:52:25
 2
And I don't know if you can bring that up.
13:52:34
 3
The medical record says, it's from March of 1998.
13:52:39
 4
And history, okay, now when you go into a doctor here, it
13:52:42
 5
says history of present illness.  History means past, in
13:52:46
 6
the past.  She's already been diagnosed with this.  We just
13:52:49
 7
don't have the records.  She's already been diagnosed.
13:52:52
 8
You don't say history of something that you have
13:52:55
 9
in the past that you haven't -- that there hasn't already
13:52:59
been a diagnosis for.  Doctors are not, you know, careless
13:53:04
about what they say in medical records.  They're not.
13:53:07
And if the cigarette companies are going to say
13:53:10
they are, okay, maybe you should think back to what
13:53:16
historically the cigarette companies have said about
13:53:18
doctors.  Maybe you should think historically about what
13:53:25
they've challenged doctors said.  Think about that.
13:53:30
Doctors are not willy-nilly here on this record.
13:53:33
So it says Miss Davis is a 58-year-old white
13:53:35
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
13:53:39
disease.  It doesn't say suggested disease.  It says
13:53:42
history of it.
13:53:43
And then Dr. Burns, the really important part of
13:53:45
this, too, that Dr. Burns was able to decipher for you, was
13:53:49
pulmonary function tests were suggesting -- okay, so she
13:53:52
had pulmonary function tests -- were suggesting
   133
13:53:55
 1
mild-to-moderate obstructive ventilatory defect.
13:54:00
 2
And if you remember, I'm glad he explained this to
13:54:05
 3
you because way outside my ability on how the lung actually
13:54:09
 4
works, and how -- the breathing and all that.
13:54:10
 5
THE COURT REPORTER:  Could you please slow down?
13:54:15
 6
MR. BYRD:  Okay.  And I speak notoriously fast as
13:54:21
 7
well.  I'm sorry.
13:54:23
 8
So I apologize to you.
13:54:24
 9
Dr. Burns, remember he explained to you how the
13:54:27
breathing capacity works and how long it takes over time
13:54:30
for that to develop that you have symptoms.
13:54:32
And remember he said -- he drew this picture.  And
13:54:39
he said let's find out -- I asked him about
13:54:41
mild-to-moderate obstructive disease, right, which is what
13:54:45
she had in March of 1998.  And it was a history of that.
13:54:48
And he pointed out that, you know, if you have
13:54:50
this, you're talking about down here.  Symptoms start up
13:54:53
here.  Because you're going to have shortness of breath.
13:54:55
You're going to have these beginning symptoms that you
13:54:58
would have around the 80 percent mark.
13:55:01
And then he said, but she was already here, in the
13:55:03
60 percent zone.  Okay.  That's what mild-to-moderate
13:55:07
means.
13:55:08
And so then I said, what is this time period right
13:55:10
here?  Okay?  What is that?  What is this time period?
   134
13:55:13
 1
What can we say about March of '98.
13:55:16
 2
And put up Dr. Burns' testimony on this.
13:55:19
 3
Dr. Burns said -- I asked him about what does that
13:55:26
 4
mean about timing.
13:55:28
 5
His answer was that if you get folks who were
13:55:29
 6
short of breath and that's why they came in to be detected,
13:55:32
 7
and say they are hovering around this 50 to 60 range -- he
13:55:37
 8
was pointing to that -- they may have had COPD that we
13:55:40
 9
could detect for ten or fifteen years, or they may have had
13:55:45
it for four or five years.
13:55:46
If you have moderate disease, okay, we know you've
13:55:50
had it for at least two or three years.
13:55:52
That's what he said.  If you have moderate
13:55:59
disease, we know you've had it for at least two or three
13:56:04
years.
13:56:05
And so I didn't pull this out of nowhere.
13:56:10
In '98, in March of 1998, she has the moderate
13:56:15
disease.  Two to three years, it will be '96.  Three years
13:56:18
will be '95.
13:56:19
Okay.  So at least, at least certainly before
13:56:23
November 21 of 1996 is it more likely than not from
13:56:26
Dr. Burns' testimony that she had it?  Of course it is.
13:56:31
She said her symptoms started in '91 or '92.
13:56:34
Okay.  There were some suggestions that they denied it
13:56:36
then.
   135
13:56:36
 1
But if you take the middle point of her saying
13:56:38
 2
'91, '92 it was happening, and then I remember, she said I
13:56:42
 3
went to -- I went to my training in October of 1993, went
13:56:46
 4
to St. Petersburg for the police training.  And that's when
13:56:52
 5
I really noticed it.  And I went to Dr. Velasquez right
13:56:55
 6
after that or shortly after that.
13:56:56
 7
So that's in October of '93 she's having these
13:56:59
 8
problems.  And she's goes to Velasquez who then said you've
13:57:02
 9
got to stop smoking.  Velasquez says you've got to quit
13:57:06
this smoking for this shortness of breath.  That was COPD.
13:57:09
That was the symptoms and manifestations of COPD right
13:57:11
then.
13:57:12
And all you have to do is listen to what Dr. Burns
13:57:14
said.  He took the March -- you know, we have the March of
13:57:18
1998 record.  And if you believe Dr. Burns in the medical
13:57:23
field -- and I submit to you that you should -- it goes
13:57:26
back at least two or three years.
13:57:28
And all I need to show is -- you know, all
13:57:30
Miss Davis needs to show is November 21, 1996.  So that's
13:57:33
even less than two years.  That's a year and a half,
13:57:36
whatever that is.
13:57:37
Okay.  So is it more likely than not?  More likely
13:57:41
than not?
13:57:42
What did -- you know, what was the defense case on
13:57:46
this?  Zero.  They brought in no medical doctor.  If there
   136
13:57:51
 1
was a doctor who could come in here and tell you what that
13:57:54
 2
March of '98 record meant, or that it meant that she only
13:57:57
 3
had it for a few months, do you think you would have heard
13:58:00
 4
about it?  Where is that person?
13:58:03
 5
Well, what they did do, what they're going to do,
13:58:05
 6
is try to say Miss Davis, who is elderly -- and we sat her
13:58:08
 7
through nine hours of deposition -- she said some things,
13:58:11
 8
we just don't believe it.  She's wrong.
13:58:13
 9
Who they did not attack, not one question, not one
13:58:18
iota of them taking Dr. Burns on in this concept.  If they
13:58:23
thought that Dr. Burns was wrong, why didn't they ask him
13:58:26
and press him on it?  Why didn't they ask him?  
13:58:31
Where was the medical thing to take to Dr. Burns?
13:58:34
Here, Dr. Burns, you said it would have been at least two
13:58:36
or three years, right?  Well, then, have you considered
13:58:39
this?  Have you thought about that?
13:58:41
They didn't do that because they can't challenge
13:58:44
Dr. Burns.  All they can do is put doubt, let's put doubt
13:58:49
in your mind.  Let's put doubt.
13:58:52
And, you know, when you hear the evidence that
13:58:57
goes on throughout the history and all this timeline we've
13:59:04
done, all the way up to Gentry, Mr. Gentry and Mr. Jupe you
13:59:08
heard from -- and that's 2011.  And then, you know, it goes
13:59:10
on.  
13:59:12
You're going to hear this ringing, Gentry and Jupe
   137
13:59:15
 1
and others, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, of doubt.
13:59:18
 2
Okay?
13:59:19
 3
MR. McCARTER:  I'm going to object, Your Honor, of
13:59:20
 4
the comparison of counsel to --
13:59:24
 5
MR. BYRD:  I didn't compare counsel.
13:59:25
 6
THE COURT:  I don't think that's quite what he
13:59:26
 7
did.  But anyway, go ahead.
13:59:31
 8
MR. BYRD:  Okay.  What's one of the products we
13:59:32
 9
showed you?  An internal secret document, never come out
13:59:35
before until the late '90s.  Doubt is our product.  That
13:59:39
was in 1969.
13:59:40
Okay?  Doubt is our product.
13:59:49
Well, I'll get into the doubt campaign later.  It
13:59:54
goes to something else, and I'll talk about that later.
13:59:57
Okay.  So have we proved all of these things that
14:00:00
we need, these three things?  Have we proved it beyond a
14:00:03
reasonable doubt?  No.  Although, I think all of our
14:00:06
experts said I have no doubt in my mind.  I think they went
14:00:09
way further and said they have no doubt.
14:00:11
But have we proved it more likely than not, the
14:00:15
standard that you have to use?  The standard that everybody
14:00:18
in that jury room uses?  Yes, we have.
14:00:20
Now, the next question you're going to deal with,
14:00:27
if you find those things, okay, then we have shown that
14:00:32
Miss Davis gets the benefit of the findings.  Okay.
   138
14:00:35
 1
And there's various findings.  I'm going to
14:00:37
 2
mention a few of them.  But the findings are going to be in
14:00:40
 3
the jury instructions as they are relevant to whatever
14:00:43
 4
question you're answering.
14:00:44
 5
And for the first question -- 
14:00:45
 6
John, if you can, show us the first finding.
14:00:51
 7
Strict liability and negligence.
14:00:58
 8
Well, the first finding is that nicotine is
14:01:04
 9
addictive.  Okay.
14:01:06
Cigarettes and nicotine -- nicotine and cigarettes
14:01:09
are addictive.  And that they cause -- that the cigarettes
14:01:14
cause COPD.  Diseases like COPD.
14:01:17
Okay.  And that's going to be --
14:01:20
Actually, don't worry about it.  It's too hard to
14:01:22
blow it up.  You'll read it in the jury room.
14:01:24
That's the finding.  Okay?
14:01:26
And the judge is going to inform you that that
14:01:28
means that if -- that the defendants will be liable for
14:01:34
strict liability and negligence as long as, you know, we
14:01:37
were smoking their cigarettes.
14:01:38
Okay.  Now, the reason we have -- you're going to
14:01:41
be asked then a question.
14:01:42
And, John, you can put that up.
14:01:44
Are they liable for negligence and strict
14:01:46
liability?  Well, the finding will be that they were
   139
14:01:48
 1
negligent because they were negligent.
14:01:51
 2
And the other finding is that they put defective
14:01:53
 3
and unreasonably dangerous products on the market.  Okay.
14:01:57
 4
That's the other finding.
14:01:58
 5
And I wish I had the findings in a nice,
14:02:00
 6
wrapped-up way for you, but I don't.  They are in the
14:02:03
 7
instructions.
14:02:03
 8
But when you put those findings together, it means
14:02:05
 9
that they are liable for negligence and strict liability as
14:02:10
long as we showed you that she smoked their products.
14:02:13
Okay.  And we showed you -- that's the only
14:02:17
question you'll see in the instructions.  You'll see in the
14:02:19
instructions what you have to consider.
14:02:21
All we basically have to show in that question is,
14:02:23
did she smoke Philip Morris products?  And did she smoke
14:02:28
R.J. Reynolds products which contributed to her injuries.
14:02:32
Okay?
14:02:33
And we don't have any other cigarette companies in
14:02:35
this room.  We didn't bring anybody here that doesn't make
14:02:38
the brands that she smokes.
14:02:40
R.J. Reynolds makes Camels.  And that was a
14:02:42
stipulated fact.  We read that to you.
14:02:45
Those were among the most important of her brands
14:02:47
because they were in her early years.
14:02:49
And then she smoked the raw majority of her time
   140
14:02:52
 1
Philip Morris cigarettes, because they make Marlboro and
14:02:55
 2
they make Marlboro Lights.
14:02:57
 3
So, are they liable when you read the instructions
14:02:59
 4
to what the judge is going to give you?  Of course they
14:03:01
 5
are, because she smoked Philip Morris cigarettes and she
14:03:04
 6
smoked Camel cigarettes made by R.J. Reynolds.  Okay?
14:03:08
 7
And that is the real question that you'll see.
14:03:11
 8
You'll see in the instructions, the Judge will tell you the
14:03:13
 9
only thing for your determination is whether she smoked the
14:03:16
cigarettes manufactured by these defendants.  And that's
14:03:18
it.  That's the essential part of that question.
14:03:20
And then you get to the next question on the
14:03:22
verdict form.  
14:03:23
John?
14:03:25
Whether -- the comparative fault question here on
14:03:31
the bottom, okay.  This is the real thing I'm trying to get
14:03:34
to as quick as I can.  I think it's the most important
14:03:37
aspect of the verdict form here, the how you weigh the
14:03:40
fault of all of these parties.  All right?
14:03:44
Does Miss Davis bear some responsibility?  Maybe.
14:03:46
Okay.  If you think she should have tried harder
14:03:49
to quit -- this is where I was telling you, if you think
14:03:52
maybe she wasn't motivated enough or she should have tried
14:03:55
harder or she should have done other things, this is where
14:03:57
you put it.  This is where you discuss that kind of thing.
   141
14:04:00
 1
And let's think a little about how you answer this
14:04:07
 2
question.  All right?  Because as we showed you over here,
14:04:09
 3
and I want to explain to you, the cigarette companies had
14:04:12
 4
100 percent of knowledge about their product.
14:04:17
 5
Okay.  They had 100 percent knowledge about their
14:04:21
 6
product.  And Miss Davis had zero, zero knowledge.  She's a
14:04:25
 7
ten-year-old girl.
14:04:26
 8
Remember, when you determine this question of
14:04:29
 9
comparative fault, you have to -- at the time, what was the
14:04:30
comparative fault in the 1950s compared to, you know, what
14:04:33
was Evonne Davis, ten-year-old, versus Philip Morris and
14:04:38
R.J. Reynolds?  What about when she was 15?  What about
14:04:40
when she was 20?  What about later?
14:04:42
And, you know, imagine it's like -- you know,
14:04:50
people have probably heard -- everybody uses cell phones.
14:04:55
Okay?  And cell phones, you know, as you've read or heard,
14:04:58
you might hear if you hold cell phones to your ear it might
14:05:02
cause brain cancer.  It's been in newspapers.  It's been in
14:05:05
news articles.  You've heard it.  Everybody keeps using
14:05:08
them.  Everybody in the world is using them.  Okay.
14:05:10
Now, what if, you know, 30, 40 years from now we
14:05:12
find out that cell phones actually do cause brain cancer,
14:05:17
number one?  And number two, what if we find out that the
14:05:21
people that made cell phones knew it, knew it from day one
14:05:30
and never told us?
   142
14:05:31
 1
Doesn't it make a difference when the people who
14:05:33
 2
manufactured the things you use know about it and they
14:05:35
 3
don't tell you?  And they hide it from you?
14:05:39
 4
It makes all of the difference in the world.  And
14:05:41
 5
you have to imagine, back then, the defendants' argument
14:05:43
 6
here is, well, she knew it was bad for her.  Really?
14:05:46
 7
We're going to blame a ten-year-old?  Is that what
14:05:48
 8
we do in this country?  Do we blame children in this
14:05:51
 9
country because they should be fully aware of the decisions
14:05:56
they're making or something?
14:05:57
Especially back in the 1950s and '60s when this
14:06:01
culture of smoking that you heard from Dr.  Kyriakoudes
14:06:04
arose.  Is that what we do?
14:06:07
So I would suggest to that when you take this
14:06:11
consideration into account, you have to understand what
14:06:15
their knowledge was about their product and versus what her
14:06:19
knowledge was.  And understand that -- you know, take that
14:06:25
into consideration as you determine the percentage of
14:06:27
fault.
14:06:28
Now, what choices did they make?  You know they're
14:06:30
going to tell you that Miss Davis came in every morning and
14:06:33
that she made choices in her life.  She woke up every
14:06:38
morning and made a choice in her life about whether she was
14:06:40
going to smoke or not.
14:06:41
Again, I submit to you I don't think we should do
   143
14:06:43
 1
that to her from the ages of ten to eighteen at least.  I
14:06:48
 2
just don't.  We submit you just don't do that to children.
14:06:51
 3
But let's look at Exhibit 832.
14:06:58
 4
Let's look at the choices that the cigarette
14:07:08
 5
companies made.  We showed you, back in 1950, when she's
14:07:12
 6
ten, they make a choice.
14:07:14
 7
Remember?  Reports linking cigarettes to disease
14:07:16
 8
and cancer.  The tobacco companies internal scientists know
14:07:21
 9
that it causes this stuff.  What choice did they make?
14:07:24
When they woke up, looked themselves in the
14:07:27
mirror, went to the boardroom, what choice did they make?
14:07:30
And if we're going to talk about the choices
14:07:32
Miss Davis made, make sure the people in the jury
14:07:34
deliberation room are thinking about the choices -- every
14:07:36
time they talk about a choice Miss Davis makes, please ask
14:07:40
what choice were the cigarette companies making at the same
14:07:44
time.
14:07:45
Okay.  When the Surgeon General came out, he came
14:07:47
out with a warning.  He asked them to provide information.
14:07:49
What choice did they make?  To withhold that information.
14:07:53
Undesirable.  Undesirable.  Don't submit it to the
14:07:58
Surgeon General.  It's undesirable.
14:07:59
And then when the Surgeon General came out and
14:08:02
said, everybody look -- and you can see this as the
14:08:05
consumption goes up.  Everybody, cigarettes may be
   144
14:08:08
 1
hazardous.
14:08:09
 2
If the cigarette companies had come out then and
14:08:12
 3
said, you know what, we agree.  We've got to get -- we're
14:08:15
 4
sorry.  We agree.  We stand with -- we stand with the
14:08:18
 5
Surgeon General of the United States.  And everybody needs
14:08:20
 6
to listen to it.
14:08:21
 7
They didn't do that.  They made a choice not to do
14:08:23
 8
that.
14:08:24
 9
And Dr. Burns told you about what that means when
14:08:26
people are in lockstep, trying to give a warning, a public
14:08:31
health warning, what that means.
14:08:32
Then they made a choice.  They made a choice to
14:08:35
make filters.  They knew they didn't work.
14:08:38
We showed you the documents.  And they even said,
14:08:41
it doesn't matter -- do you remember why would they do
14:08:46
this?  We must provide a psychological crutch and a
14:08:50
self-rationale to continue smoking.
14:08:52
That was their secret internal documents.  They
14:08:56
didn't tell people they were providing a psychological
14:08:58
crutch in public.
14:08:59
We must do that.  And they start making filters.
14:09:01
Okay?
14:09:03
And then they make lights to do the same thing.
14:09:09
All along this map of her lifetime, they made
14:09:11
choices, too.  And then they made a choice -- 
   145
14:09:13
 1
They talked to her about she should have tried
14:09:16
 2
harder to quit.
14:09:17
 3
And, oh, it was 1985.  Remember that?  1985 she
14:09:22
 4
was doing the Waterpik filter.
14:09:24
 5
They said she's not trying to quit.  And, oh, did
14:09:27
 6
you ever participate in the Great American Smokeout?
14:09:30
 7
Remember, they made this big thing about the Great American
14:09:32
 8
Smokeout.  Okay?
14:09:34
 9
They are talking to her, why didn't she do things
14:09:36
like that to quit in 1985.  Okay?
14:09:40
Nicorette gum.  Why weren't you doing that kind of
14:09:44
stuff?  Okay.  Well, she did, by the way, use Nicorette gum
14:09:47
and did the Great American Smokeout.  It didn't work.
14:09:49
What were the cigarette companies doing at the
14:09:54
same time?
14:09:55
Jeff, Exhibit 1501.
14:09:57
Oh, they were sending this to their customers.
14:10:04
Your Great American Smoker's kit.  Remember?  
14:10:06
Jeff, just flip through.
14:10:06
A message.  Sincerely, from your friends at Philip
14:10:09
Morris.
14:10:10
You don't need to participate in the Great
14:10:11
American Smokeout.  You know what?  If your friends are
14:10:16
egging you on and telling you to participate and try to
14:10:18
quit, you know, let's give you some clever comebacks.
   146
14:10:23
 1
Do you know what people who do that are?  Do you
14:10:25
 2
know what they're doing?  Here's a little sticker.  Don't
14:10:28
 3
nag me.  I'm a Great American Smoker.  That's what they
14:10:31
 4
sent out in '85, the mid-'80s.  
14:10:34
 5
And then go on.  If you have somebody bothering
14:10:37
 6
you, here's what you tell them.  Okay?  This is what you
14:10:40
 7
do.  This is their message in the mid-'80s.
14:10:43
 8
Sure, they get to come in today into court and
14:10:45
 9
say, well, look, smoking is addictive.
14:10:47
We're not -- we don't agree with that.  Smoking is
14:10:49
bad for you.  Everybody should quit as soon as they can.
14:10:51
Of course, they're going to say that now.
14:10:54
But this isn't a case about now.  This is a case
14:10:57
about what they said over the lifetime of Miss Davis.
14:11:01
And then Nicorette gum.  You know, this is brought
14:11:06
to you by the cigarette companies.  Brought to you by the
14:11:10
cigarette companies that say, you know --
14:11:15
By the way, essentially their argument is -- 
14:11:17
You know, imagine, they're going to get up here to
14:11:19
talk.  So one of the reasons I'm doing this is I'm not
14:11:21
going to get to talk to you after.  So I do want you to
14:11:24
think about when they talk, you know, what would I say in
14:11:27
response because I can't get back up and talk to you again
14:11:29
to counter anything they say.  So I'm trying to predict a
14:11:32
little bit.
   147
14:11:33
 1
But, you know, people can just -- their central
14:11:40
 2
defense is, you know, yeah, we make this horrible thing and
14:11:43
 3
it's awful.  But do you know what?  It's our customers'
14:11:47
 4
fault for buying them.
14:11:48
 5
I want you to listen and see if you don't think
14:11:51
 6
that's essentially the argument.  I mean, imagine, this
14:11:55
 7
is -- you know, we're coming into court.  There's certain
14:11:59
 8
things that a company shouldn't do.  And this is an
14:12:02
 9
argument.  Okay?  And you all need to make a determination
14:12:04
about this.  It's important.
14:12:05
A company is going to come in and say, you should
14:12:10
have known better than to believe us and buy our product.
14:12:13
You're crazy.  Why did you buy our product?
14:12:15
That's the argument.  That's the argument we're
14:12:18
going to check on the box and say, okay, okay, go home.
14:12:22
They're going to come in here and say you just
14:12:25
check a box no on the class membership and you get to go
14:12:28
home.
14:12:29
They're going to tell you that.  Just come in
14:12:30
here, check a box and go.  Hoping you won't want to look at
14:12:34
the evidence.  Hoping you won't want to read all the
14:12:36
documents and materials here.
14:12:38
Read it.  You're a better jury than that.  You're
14:12:40
a better jury than that.  There will be plenty of time to
14:12:44
go home.  But this is your time to make a determination
   148
14:12:48
 1
from documents that a lot of people don't see.  And it's
14:12:51
 2
your time to give Miss Davis her fair trial, the tobacco
14:12:55
 3
companies their fair trial.  Read the documents.
14:12:58
 4
Read the documents.  I put the exhibit numbers on
14:13:01
 5
here.  You're not going to be able to have this back in the
14:13:04
 6
room with you, this timeline.
14:13:05
 7
Read the documents that I put up there.  Make your
14:13:08
 8
own determination.
14:13:08
 9
What were they doing to Nicorette gum?  Okay.
14:13:11
Think about this.
14:13:12
Jeff, bring up Exhibit 34.
14:13:16
Do you remember the Dow Chemical store, the
14:13:19
Nicorette gum?  They're going to talk about what she should
14:13:22
have done in the mid-'80s.  Let's look at what they were
14:13:26
doing 1982 through '85.
14:13:27
They were telling the people making the Nicorette
14:13:30
gum, Nicorette gum shouldn't be a problem.  Because the
14:13:33
cigarette companies say you can just put your cigarettes
14:13:35
down whenever you want.  All you have to do is throw your
14:13:36
ashtray out and you're done.  That's their argument, isn't
14:13:38
it?  Really?
14:13:40
Because I think they're really concerned about
14:13:42
Nicorette gum here.  And I wonder why they're concerned
14:13:45
about Nicorette gum.
14:13:47
And, you know, the deal they find -- if you can
   149
14:13:50
 1
read this.
14:13:51
 2
Jeff, can you bring it up bigger?  Because I'm
14:13:51
 3
having trouble reading it that far away.
14:13:51
 4
You know, they were threatening to take away their
14:13:56
 5
business from Dow Chemical, because they get all these
14:13:59
 6
chemicals to make cigarettes from Dow Chemical.
14:14:01
 7
Through a series of meetings over the past few
14:14:03
 8
years, Dow has been repeatedly advised of our displeasure
14:14:07
 9
over the anti-smoking nature of Dow Merrill's Nicorette
14:14:11
program.
14:14:12
We had been assured that Nicorette would have a
14:14:15
low-key introduction and would be aimed only at those
14:14:20
smokers who had to stop for medical reasons.
14:14:24
This is what they're doing.  They are cutting
14:14:30
arrangements with Dow Chemical.  You know, you can use
14:14:33
Nicorette gum, but please don't give it to anybody unless
14:14:36
they're sick already.
14:14:37
Where is the free choice in that?
14:14:41
So we'll keep everybody else addicted.  You can
14:14:44
help people once they get too sick and they're on their way
14:14:47
to the grave.
14:14:48
How about that?  That's the choice they make.
14:14:50
Because Miss Davis didn't wake up in the morning
14:14:52
and make that decision.
14:14:53
And they can't just wipe that off the table.  They
   150
14:14:56
 1
made decisions, too.  And they brought you nobody, zero.
14:14:59
 2
Nobody from their company came in here to explain what was
14:15:02
 3
going on in this thing.  Or to explain it away, say
14:15:05
 4
something was not what they were doing.  Because they
14:15:08
 5
can't.
14:15:08
 6
So you can make a determination --
14:15:12
 7
You can put that down.
14:15:13
 8
When you make a determination on the percentage of
14:15:15
 9
fault, here's what I would suggest.
14:15:20
You know, Miss Davis, I believe -- I think you
14:15:25
should look at the time that she smoked.  And from 1950,
14:15:30
okay, to 1966, there were no warnings on cigarettes at all.
14:15:35
And, by the way, she's a child.
14:15:38
And then from 19 -- all the way to 1985, okay,
14:15:41
1985 is the first time, okay, that she was told on a
14:15:49
cigarette pack.  You know, she said she saw the warning on
14:15:51
a pack every day.
14:15:52
Okay.  Let's buy that.  The first time she was
14:15:54
told that it may cause or that it causes emphysema, 1985.
14:15:59
So from 1950 to 1985, for 35 years of her smoking
14:16:03
history, okay, I submit to you that because she was a
14:16:07
child, because of the activities they were engaging in,
14:16:10
because the warning didn't come on until here about
14:16:13
emphysema, that she should bear no responsibility for that.
14:16:17
Okay.  If you want to bear some responsibility for
   151
14:16:19
 1
her, look at the years, divide it up and see the percentage
14:16:22
 2
of time.
14:16:22
 3
From 1985 on.  Okay.  You know, apply some fault
14:16:27
 4
to her because you think she didn't try hard enough.  She
14:16:30
 5
was doing the Waterpik filter.
14:16:32
 6
But don't forget, all along they didn't even admit
14:16:36
 7
it causes cancer or other diseases.  They didn't do that
14:16:38
 8
until after her COPD.
14:16:39
 9
So when you look at what she was doing between '85
14:16:44
to '99, look at what they were doing, too.
14:16:46
And I would submit that an appropriate division --
14:16:50
you know, you're going to set the division.  You're going
14:16:53
to set the percentage of fault.
14:16:55
I would submit that Miss Davis bears no more than
14:16:58
10 to 20 percent responsibility.  Okay?  And then you
14:17:01
divide it up among Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds based on
14:17:05
what they did.
14:17:06
She smoked Philip Morris for the longest, no
14:17:09
doubt.  She did Marlboro and Marlboro Light.  And maybe
14:17:11
they are 50 or 60 percent responsible.
14:17:13
And maybe R.J. Reynolds is, you know, 20 or 30
14:17:15
percent responsible.  But don't forget, R.J. Reynolds is
14:17:18
going to come up here and say, well, she didn't really --
14:17:18
there is no evidence she smoked hardly any Camels.  Well,
14:17:21
that's not true.  She smoked Camels when she was a kid.
   152
14:17:25
 1
Don't forget the reason that they need a
14:17:27
 2
percentage of fault that is meaningful and lets them know
14:17:31
 3
about their part in this, because of their knowledge as
14:17:34
 4
well that they had.  Don't forget, this is when your brain
14:17:39
 5
is forming, and how important those early cigarettes are.
14:17:42
 6
So, you know, we say, sure, Miss Davis take some
14:17:47
 7
fault, 10 to 20 percent fault?  And we think that when we
14:17:51
 8
really view the evidence, that that's appropriate.
14:17:52
 9
Don't forget, they had 100 percent of the
14:17:54
knowledge.  And they tried to do everything they could to
14:17:57
keep her knowledge as low, as close to zero as possible.
14:18:00
They deliberately played down the role of
14:18:03
nicotine, they said.  And they went out on television, they
14:18:08
lied.  They said if we ever find anything, we're going to
14:18:10
take it out.  They didn't.
14:18:12
And think about all that -- you know, they built
14:18:14
this thing up as a -- Dr.  Kyriakoudes showed you what they
14:18:17
did in their advertising.  They didn't show anybody walking
14:18:21
around with a breathing problem.  Everybody was happy,
14:18:23
playing sports, running around.
14:18:26
Now, we're going to go on to -- let's talk about
14:18:34
this advertising, because you're going to be asked
14:18:37
questions about what is known as the intentional torts.
14:18:40
And I guess I'm going to have to -- I'm rushing here.
14:18:42
How much time do I have?
   153
14:18:46
 1
I'm not going to go over the -- this in-depth.
14:18:50
 2
But you're going to basically be asked -- there's two more
14:18:53
 3
sections you're going to be asked about, fraudulent
14:18:55
 4
concealment.
14:18:56
 5
And what we suggest to you is that they hid, and
14:18:58
 6
we showed you on the timeline where they hid and lied about
14:19:01
 7
the dangers of the product.  They lied whether it caused
14:19:03
 8
disease or not.
14:19:05
 9
They also hid -- remember, these yellow tags here
14:19:08
represent the studies that they were doing.  Okay?  They
14:19:10
were studying to see how well can they manipulate the
14:19:13
levels of nicotine.  Miss Davis didn't know about that.
14:19:16
How can they -- how can they get the lowest -- how
14:19:20
low can they go to get a habituating level of nicotine.
14:19:23
They knew what they were doing.
14:19:25
Miss Davis didn't know they were setting the
14:19:27
nicotine level and adjusting the pH and engineering this
14:19:30
product and putting filters and vent holes on it.
14:19:32
I mean, have you ever seen vent holes on these
14:19:35
things?
14:19:35
I mean, what were they used for?  We showed you in
14:19:39
the evidence.  And she didn't know about that.
14:19:41
And so these questions go to their concealment and
14:19:45
fraud.  And did that play a role in what happened to her?
14:19:49
Of course it did.
   154
14:19:50
 1
And then you're going to have to make a
14:19:51
 2
determination.  It's honestly a lot of legal mumbo jumbo
14:19:57
 3
that I don't want to get into.
14:19:58
 4
But here's the deal.  You're going to have to
14:20:00
 5
answer questions about May 5 of 1982.  There's no reason
14:20:03
 6
you need to be concerned about.  Nothing important happened
14:20:06
 7
on May 5 of 1982.
14:20:08
 8
But all you need to be asked is when did their
14:20:10
 9
agreement, when did their fraudulent concealment happen?
14:20:13
And then when we get to the conspiracy question, you're
14:20:15
going to be asked when did the conspiracy happen.
14:20:18
Of course, it happened before 1982.  We showed you
14:20:21
all that.
14:20:21
And did it continue?  Of course it did.
14:20:23
They kept lying.  Lied to Congress in '94.  They
14:20:27
didn't do anything until 2000.
14:20:29
Of course, it kept going on and on.  Okay?
14:20:31
Now, so we submit to you that, yes, they are
14:20:33
liable, that their fraud and concealment was before and
14:20:36
after.  Okay.  It was both, before and after.
14:20:38
And then their conspiracy, you're going to be
14:20:40
instructed that for this question and the next question,
14:20:42
the Engle findings, remember, they will be -- they will
14:20:45
have taken hold.  And you have to give her the benefit of
14:20:48
those findings.
   155
14:20:49
 1
And you're going to be instructed that they
14:20:52
 2
concealed information.  You can't question it.  It's
14:20:55
 3
already been determined.
14:20:56
 4
And you're going to be instructed that they
14:20:57
 5
engaged in a conspiracy, an agreement with each other.
14:21:00
 6
Remember that Plaza Hotel meeting in 1954?  And it
14:21:04
 7
continued.  They said -- you know, they got their plan for
14:21:07
 8
their campaign of doubt and their truth squad.  Remember
14:21:11
 9
all of that?  That's what they did.  And that conspiracy
14:21:13
continued and continued and continued.  Until at least
14:21:17
after she had COPD.  If not further.  At least until 1999.
14:21:25
Now, let's go to -- let's go to damages.  You
14:21:33
know, you've heard about -- actually, let's talk about -- 
14:21:37
Can you bring up Exhibit 177?  And then 129?
14:21:41
These are the two FTC reports.
14:21:45
Dr.  Kyriakoudes talked about advertising.  And I
14:21:48
don't want you to forget, one thing the FTC determined,
14:21:52
okay, well, they are going to tell you that Miss Davis
14:21:54
didn't hear any of this.  Miss Davis didn't know anything
14:21:56
about -- she can't remember an advertisement she relied on
14:21:59
and that kind of stuff.  She can't remember.
14:22:01
Well, I mean, who can remember.  I mean, let's
14:22:04
think about like cereal.  Can you remember what Fruit Loop
14:22:09
commercial you saw as a kid?  What day you heard it?  What
14:22:12
time?  All of these questions.  No.
   156
14:22:13
 1
But do you know that cereal advertising had an
14:22:15
 2
impact?  Probably.
14:22:18
 3
You think people advertise for no reason?  
14:22:20
 4
Remember Dr. Robert Heimann said -- he was the
14:22:25
 5
deposition where he said the Surgeon General is wrong, dead
14:22:27
 6
wrong.  And I disagree with the Cancer Society and medical
14:22:31
 7
doctors.  And I know better than medical doctors.  Remember
14:22:34
 8
that guy?
14:22:35
 9
He said, we expect people to trust our
14:22:38
advertising.  It's truthful.  It's our promise to the
14:22:40
customer.  That's what he said.
14:22:41
And then what did they do in the advertising?
14:22:41
Cigarette advertising reaches virtually all Americans who
14:22:44
can either read or understand the spoken word.
14:22:47
Cigarettes are advertised on both network and spot
14:22:49
television, on radio, in magazines, and in newspapers, in
14:22:53
outdoor media, and by means of many types of points of sale
14:22:56
of advertising aids.
14:22:58
So pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is
14:23:01
virtually impossible for persons of almost any age to avoid
14:23:06
cigarette advertising.
14:23:07
They ramped it up, too.  That's the '67 Surgeon
14:23:10
General report.
14:23:10
The '81 Surgeon General report -- Jeff -- that's
14:23:13
the one -- I won't read it.  That's the one that tells us
   157
14:23:16
 1
they spent more than one day on advertising than the public
14:23:20
 2
health authority spent in a year, telling people not to
14:23:24
 3
smoke.
14:23:24
 4
That's a lot of power.  That's a lot of money.
14:23:29
 5
And all for what?  Because -- 
14:23:37
 6
We won't pull this document up.  But it was
14:23:39
 7
Exhibit 72.  Exhibit 72 I submit to you is worth reading.
14:23:42
 8
And if you can pull Exhibit 72.  It's a 1982
14:23:46
 9
document, after the May 5, 1982, date.
14:23:49
December 1982.  Talks about the exit and entry
14:23:52
gates.  You know, if the exit gates are ever opened, our
14:23:56
people flood out, our business will be out of business
14:23:58
overnight.
14:23:59
Read the document.  Exhibit 72.  It will be back
14:24:02
there with you.  You can read it.
14:24:04
We can't ever be comfortable selling a product
14:24:06
which most of our customers could stop using if they could.
14:24:12
So then that comes down to damages that we're
14:24:21
going to see in this case.  And you'll be instructed.  I'm
14:24:23
not going to waste my time.  You read the jury
14:24:24
instructions.
14:24:25
I mean, I can't emphasize enough that when you
14:24:27
have a question on the verdict form, first go to the jury
14:24:30
instructions and read exactly what you're instructed to do,
14:24:33
because that is your bible, so to speak, on this issue.
   158
14:24:36
 1
And, you know, I told you originally when I came
14:24:39
 2
in that I was going to, you know, have to ask for a
14:24:42
 3
substantial number, and I thought the evidence would
14:24:46
 4
support that.
14:24:47
 5
And, you know, it's not easy to come up with a
14:24:50
 6
number that you ask for in a case like this.  You know, if
14:24:53
 7
somebody had -- if somebody had like a car injury, hurt
14:24:57
 8
themselves and broke a leg or something, and they were out
14:25:00
 9
of commission for a week or two, and then maybe I'd have to
14:25:04
come in here and ask for thousands of dollars or $10,000 or
14:25:07
something like that.
14:25:09
You know, the amount and what is the injury, how
14:25:11
debilitating, and how long is the recovery period is how I
14:25:15
would look at that.
14:25:16
But then, you know, I guess if somebody has some
14:25:18
sort of injury, you know, their leg is completely -- it
14:25:20
will never be better again.  It's been destroyed.  It has
14:25:25
pins in it.  They'll never walk the same again.  And that's
14:25:27
going to be for a long time.  Or maybe it's going to be ten
14:25:30
years of rehabilitation to ever get back.  It's a longer
14:25:34
period of time, serious injury.  Then I have to come in and
14:25:37
ask for hundreds of thousands for something like that.
14:25:39
But, you know, when an injury is fatal, you're
14:25:43
never going to get better.  It's only going to get worse.
14:25:45
You're going to have to live with it forever.  You're going
   159
14:25:49
 1
to die with it prematurely.  You're going to leave people
14:25:52
 2
behind.  That kind of injury is where I have to get in the
14:25:57
 3
millions.
14:25:59
 4
And, you know, Miss Davis, she -- you know, you
14:26:03
 5
can talk about comparative fault.  She's taken her part of
14:26:10
 6
the fault.  She got COPD.  She's a vibrant, you know,
14:26:14
 7
firefighter -- or tried to become a firefighter and was a
14:26:19
 8
police officer.
14:26:19
 9
And then ultimately, you know, had the rib injury.
14:26:23
But then she had the COPD, and her breathing problems got
14:26:27
worse and worse.
14:26:28
And Dr. Burns told you what happened.  Showed you
14:26:30
the graph.  She's down to 30 percent now, and she's going
14:26:33
to be hospitalized more and more and more.  She's been
14:26:36
tethered to an oxygen tank like this for years.
14:26:40
She puts a breathing tube in her nose.  And that
14:26:46
breathing tube she has to breathe with constantly leads to
14:26:51
bloody noses all the time, dry noses.  She's got to have
14:26:55
it.  She's got to do breathing treatments constantly.
14:26:57
She'll never get better.  She'll only get worse.
14:27:00
She has to think about leaving her lovely son, Tommy,
14:27:02
behind, who has a severe brain injury, and worried about
14:27:07
who's going to take care of him when she's gone.
14:27:10
Remember, you heard her testify, I just want
14:27:12
somebody who's not going to make fun of him, not going to
   160
14:27:14
 1
give him a rough time.  That's something she thinks about
14:27:17
 2
every night.
14:27:17
 3
And she's going to have these COPD exacerbations.
14:27:21
 4
You know, chest.  Can't catch a breath.  Dr. Burns
14:27:24
 5
explained what happens in the COPD exacerbation.
14:27:27
 6
When I have to get to that kind of number and I
14:27:30
 7
have to ask in the millions, you know, I would encourage
14:27:33
 8
you -- it's a number for you to decide.  You can go higher
14:27:36
 9
than I ask, by the way.  But you can go lower, of course,
14:27:39
too.
14:27:40
But I would submit the number, the minimum number,
14:27:42
should correlate to the number of puffs of cigarettes that
14:27:46
we calculated she had.
14:27:48
MR. McCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's not
14:27:49
a proper basis.
14:27:50
MR. BYRD:  Well, I can explain the basis, Your
14:27:51
Honor.
14:27:51
THE COURT:  Okay.
14:27:52
MR. BYRD:  Let me explain the basis.  Because
14:27:55
Dr. Burns explained that every puff of a cigarette freezes
14:27:59
the cilia.  That's dangerous.  And every puff lets
14:28:02
irritants and chemicals and carcinogens come in.  Every
14:28:07
puff, he said.  And it goes over and over.  And each one of
14:28:10
those cause damage to your cells and then to your airways,
14:28:13
which lead to COPD.
   161
14:28:15
 1
So it's not one puff that does this.  It's
14:28:18
 2
7 million puffs doing their job of freezing your cilia and
14:28:21
 3
loading you up with irritants over and over and over.
14:28:24
 4
So I would ask and submit the appropriate amount
14:28:26
 5
of damages for Miss Davis is $7 million.
14:28:32
 6
And the judge will tell you you don't reduce for
14:28:35
 7
comparative fault.  So if you find that that number is
14:28:39
 8
accurate, $7 million, but let's say you found her
14:28:41
 9
50 percent at fault, or whatever; I'm just using that
14:28:44
example.  I don't think you should come near 50 percent.
14:28:47
But let's say you use 50 percent fault.  That
14:28:49
doesn't mean you put in $3.5 million.  The judge will deal
14:28:52
with those kind of issues.  You will put in the full
14:28:56
$7 million and let him deal with comparative fault.
14:28:58
And the comparative fault will go to the first two
14:29:00
claims.  They're going to be 100 percent liable, by the
14:29:04
way, for their intentional torts, for their fraud and their
14:29:06
conspiracy.  They'll be 100 percent responsible for that.
14:29:08
Now, the last question --
14:29:11
Your Honor, could I get an additional minute or
14:29:13
two?
14:29:14
THE COURT:  All right.  I will give you an
14:29:16
additional five minutes, but I'm going to cut you off in
14:29:19
midstream if you go beyond that.
14:29:20
MR. BYRD:  Sure.  That's fine.  So that means I'm
   162
14:29:22
 1
11 minutes.
14:29:23
 2
Now, there's a final question to be asked about
14:29:31
 3
whether punitive damages are warranted.
14:29:33
 4
And punitive damages -- if you can get the
14:29:35
 5
instruction here, John, the punitive damage instruction.
14:29:47
 6
And I apologize.
14:29:54
 7
Paragraph two says -- here's the standard.  You
14:29:59
 8
need to read the whole thing.  But punitive damages are
14:30:02
 9
available if the cigarette companies' conduct is so gross
14:30:06
and flagrant as to show such a reckless disregard of a
14:30:10
conscious indifference to human life or health that an
14:30:13
award of compensatory damages is insufficient to punish
14:30:17
that defendant for its misconduct -- and this is the
14:30:19
important part -- or to deter it from engaging in such
14:30:24
misconduct in the future.
14:30:25
And this is to deter this company and other
14:30:32
companies from doing things like this.  A deterrence.
14:30:36
And that's why, you know, you don't put -- we're
14:30:38
not talking about any amount or anything like that.  That
14:30:40
would -- is it warranted?  Did they show reckless disregard
14:30:45
for human life?  Of course, they did.
14:30:49
And when you consider this question of, you know
14:30:51
-- of this kind of conduct to deter them, you can consider
14:30:59
the kind of conduct that hurt Miss Davis doesn't hurt
14:31:02
others.  And it does.
   163
14:31:04
 1
And you even heard from Mr. Jupe and Mr. Gentry.
14:31:08
 2
Pick that up.  They both confirmed to you.  It's from their
14:31:12
 3
own mouths.  They know.  Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.
14:31:16
 4
They killed -- 400,000 American customers die every year.
14:31:19
 5
They both said it.  And Dr. Burns actually gave
14:31:21
 6
you the most recent numbers are 480,000 a year.  Twenty
14:31:26
 7
million have died prematurely.  Okay?
14:31:30
 8
And, you know, we showed you that graph.
14:31:35
 9
If you could show the consumption chart, you know,
14:31:38
that lung cancer --
14:31:40
Here's the thing.  You know, when Miss Davis picks
14:31:43
up a cigarette or an individual picks up a cigarette and
14:31:46
you take a smoke, and maybe eventually when you do
14:31:49
understand that there are hazards, you may not know what
14:31:52
hazards mean.  You think it's a scratchy throat or a cough
14:31:55
or bronchitis and get over it.
14:31:57
When you really understand this is a lifelong
14:31:59
disease that you will never recover from and that's what
14:32:02
you're dealing with.
14:32:03
You know, you take this puff of the cigarette and
14:32:04
you know of -- you know, you go, well, what are the odds.
14:32:07
Maybe I get it, maybe I don't.
14:32:09
You know, the odds are probably worse than a
14:32:11
smoker really wants to acknowledge.  But they do think,
14:32:13
well, you know, chance is I don't get anything.  I'll be
   164
14:32:15
 1
fine.  That's kind of what they're looking at.  That's kind
14:32:17
 2
of how they think about it.
14:32:23
 3
But when Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, they go
14:32:26
 4
into the boardroom -- and Miss Davis wakes up in the
14:32:29
 5
morning.  Philip Morris goes into the boardroom, and they
14:32:31
 6
sit down, it's not an if.  They know it's certain, 400,000
14:32:36
 7
a year.
14:32:36
 8
They may not know which ones.  They may not know
14:32:43
 9
which ones or who.  They know for certain, that not an if,
14:32:48
400,000 a year.
14:32:49
That's disregard for human life.  I can't think of
14:32:55
a better example for facts to meet the definition.  Read
14:33:00
the definition of punitive damage and try to explain how
14:33:03
that is not a disregard for human life to keep up this kind
14:33:07
of conduct.
14:33:09
And then to start, you know, let's go find the
14:33:13
children.  Why?  Because we showed you the evidence.
14:33:18
The children start -- 95 percent of their business
14:33:21
starts between 14 and 25.
14:33:26
And let's get the children.  Because they know
14:33:28
they're the only place for replacement smoker.  Today's
14:33:31
teenager is tomorrow's regular customer.  They're saying
14:33:34
that in '81.
14:33:35
The Surgeon General report from 2012 -- I'm not
14:33:38
going to pull it back up here.  They said it continues.
   165
14:33:40
 1
They're still doing it.
14:33:41
 2
Back here, they were studying kids.  Remember, we
14:33:44
 3
put up -- it's Exhibit 595.  It's not on the board.
14:33:48
 4
Exhibit 595.  They were studying children with ADD.  In
14:33:53
 5
elementary school.  What is that?
14:33:57
 6
Studying kids with ADD.  Not to help them with
14:34:00
 7
ADD; to sell them cigarettes.
14:34:02
 8
MR. McCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.  Documents
14:34:08
 9
said the opposite.
14:34:10
THE COURT:  Well, I don't remember.  It's the
14:34:16
jury's recollection to recall, but, of course, you're free
14:34:17
to refer to that in your summation. 
14:34:18
MR. BYRD:  Smoking behavior they were studying.
14:34:20
Okay?  Smoking behavior of children.  That's what they were
14:34:24
saying.  Go find them.
14:34:25
And when we study them, by the way, go get them at
14:34:29
the recreation centers, soda fountains, the lakes, the
14:34:32
pools.  Why?  I didn't make this up.  It was in the
14:34:35
documents.  The parents won't be there.  Give some more
14:34:36
truthful answers.  The parents won't be there.
14:34:39
Is that the kind of conduct that needs deterrence
14:34:41
in this country?  Do we need to deter that kind of conduct
14:34:45
when the 2012 Surgeon General report says it still goes on?
14:34:53
Yes, I think we do.
14:34:54
This graph is the last thing I'll say.  This graph
   166
14:34:57
 1
shows a tragedy in America.  Okay?  These companies have
14:35:03
 2
killed grandparents.  They've killed grandmothers.  They've
14:35:10
 3
killed aunts and uncles.  They've killed mommies and
14:35:16
 4
daddies.  They've killed cousins and siblings, brothers and
14:35:29
 5
sisters.
14:35:29
 6
And make no mistake, the replacement smokers are
14:35:37
 7
children.
14:35:38
 8
One of them many years ago was Miss Davis, eight,
14:35:44
 9
ten years old she starts smoking.  Loses her mom.  Dad
14:35:52
can't take care of them.  Goes into a juvenile home, an
14:36:00
orphanage, a juvenile hall.  And she smokes away there.
14:36:02
Why?  Because everybody did it.  Because back then
14:36:02
they thought -- because that's what you did back then.  You
14:36:06
let kids smoke.
14:36:07
This case warrants punitive damages.  And
14:36:15
precisely because of the exact same type of conduct that
14:36:18
they engaged in that hurt Miss Davis.
14:36:22
Can she point to a specific advertisement?  No.
14:36:26
Do you think any of the 400,000 people -- do you think
14:36:30
anybody can point to the specific ad that they remember?
14:36:33
But, you know, I promise you, people of that
14:36:34
generation, people who -- you all are young.  But there's a
14:36:40
lot of people from a different generation.  If you were
14:36:42
alive during this time in the '30s, '40s, and '50s and
14:36:46
you heard Call for Philip Morris, you knew that.  Everyone
   167
14:36:53
 1
knew that.
14:36:54
 2
Walk a Mile for a Camel.  You knew it.  It didn't
14:36:58
 3
just not have an impact.  Of course it had an impact.
14:37:01
 4
Reliance?  What was Miss Davis' reliance on this,
14:37:06
 5
you're going to be asked?  Did she rely before 1982, after
14:37:13
 6
1982?
14:37:16
 7
Every time.  She lit and puffed this away.  Here's
14:37:21
 8
her reliance.  One after the other.  From 1950 until 2005.
14:37:27
 9
Thank you for your time.  Miss Davis appreciates
14:37:30
your time and your careful consideration of all the
14:37:34
evidence as long as you need to make sure you do the right
14:37:38
thing.
