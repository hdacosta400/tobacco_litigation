11           MR. PERSONS:  Counsel, Mrs. Ellis, ladies and
12      gentlemen, good afternoon.
13           JURORS:  Good afternoon.
14           MR. PERSONS:  This case is about Clarence
15      Ellis and unfiltered Lucky Strikes.  When I came
16      before you for opening statement, that's what I
17      said, and that's still true, and that's what I plan
18      to spend my time before you talking about.
19           Before I get into the meat of my argument, I
20      would be remiss if I didn't say thank you for the
21      time that you've devoted to this case, taking time
22      out of your lives for the past two weeks and one
23      day, and on behalf of I think everyone associated
24      with this process, I simply want to say thank you
25      for that. 3230
1           Now, on to the case at hand.  And -- put up a
2      board.  I think that the information that you need
3      in order to answer the questions on the verdict
4      form are contained in this list.  And the evidence
5      in this case has shown that Mr. Ellis did not start
6      smoking or continue smoking because of anything
7      that the tobacco companies said or did.
8           For one thing, he grew up on a tobacco -- a
9      farm that raised tobacco and raised it
10      commercially.  He grew up around it.  His father
11      smoked roll-your-own cigarettes.  He began smoking
12      when he was 18.  We'll get into that in a minute.
13      That's going to be what the overwhelming evidence
14      demonstrates.
15           And there wasn't anything in advertising that
16      caused him to start smoking or to continue to
17      smoke.  He was warned about the dangers of smoking
18      throughout his life, ever since he was a small
19      child, because his father urged him not to smoke.
20      And we'll talk about that.
21           Despite knowing that smoking was dangerous, he
22      continued to smoke.  There is no dispute about
23      that.  Mr. Ellis did not have primary lung cancer.
24      You heard Dr. Okun testify about how the workup was
25      such that you couldn't conclude that it was, in 3231
1      fact, a cancer that started in his lung, and that's
2      what a primary lung cancer means, that it started
3      there.
4           Mr. Ellis had the ability to quit smoking and,
5      thereby, to prevent his death.  Lots of evidence
6      about that, including what Dr. Jaffe shared with
7      you, but also some other evidence that came from
8      Mrs. Ellis.
9           Now, you heard a lot about the Engle findings.
10           THE COURT:  Is everybody able to see the
11      screen?  Okay.
12           MR. PERSONS:  And if you can't -- thank you,
13      Judge.
14           THE COURT:  Okay.
15           MR. PERSONS:  But it wasn't necessary to
16      reprove the Engle findings, because as I mentioned
17      before in opening, Engle findings have already been
18      proven, they were considered by another jury.  They
19      don't come into play in this case until there is a
20      determination that Mr. Ellis is a member of the
21      Engle class.  That has to be done.  That's the
22      first thing that has to be done before the Engle
23      findings come into play at all.
24           Now, let me talk about some of the things that
25      this case is not about but you heard some things 3232
1      about.
2           You heard about filters, when Dr. Cummings was
3      testifying he talked about filtered cigarettes.
4      Well, Mr. Ellis primarily smoked unfiltered Lucky
5      Strike cigarettes.  If he bummed a filtered
6      cigarette, he would tear the filter off.
7           He smoked less than two cartons of any other
8      cigarette, including Winston.  It was a filtered
9      cigarette.  So it was all unfiltered Lucky Strike
10      that he smoked.  So evidence on filters has nothing
11      to do with the case.
12           Addiction design.  It's been known that
13      cigarettes are inhalable since the 1800s when they
14      were invented in Turkey back in the 1860s.  And
15      from there they went to England and then to the
16      United States.  Reynolds didn't make its first
17      commercial cigarette until 1913.
18           Cigarettes are by definition inhalable.  There
19      is no such thing as a cigarette that's not
20      inhalable, as opposed to other forms of tobacco.
21      Chewing tobacco or smoking cigars.  Most cigar
22      smokers don't inhale because it's too harsh.
23           Cigarettes with or without additives are
24      equally dangerous.  We heard that concession from
25      Dr. Cummings when he was on the stand.  Whether 3233
1      they've got additives or they don't have additives,
2      they are equally dangerous because there is no such
3      thing as a safe cigarette.
4           And while we're talking about additives, Lucky
5      Strike between 1974 and 19 -- and for the rest of
6      the time that Mr. Ellis smoked Lucky Strike, they
7      didn't have ammonia.
8           And you can look at that list of ingredients
9      that's in the interrogatory answer that will be in
10      evidence and you won't find for Lucky Strike
11      anything about levulinic acid.  It simply isn't
12      there.  So those are red herrings.  They have
13      nothing to do with Mr. Ellis or with unfiltered
14      Lucky Strikes.
15           Roll-your-own cigarettes are more dangerous
16      and addictive than commercial cigarettes.  It took
17      some doing to get that from Dr. Cummings and to
18      confront him with several transcripts from prior
19      testimony but he conceded that, that roll-your-own
20      cigarettes are more dangerous and more addictive
21      than commercial cigarettes.
22           No Surgeon General in the history of the
23      United States has said that a no-nicotine cigarette
24      is somehow safer than a cigarette containing
25      nicotine.  It's just never been said.  Surgeon 3234
1      General said a lot of things, but he's never said
2      that.
3           Smokers today are no more addicted than prior
4      generations.  That's just a simple fact.  And
5      bottom line, cigarettes can't be made safe.
6      Cigarettes are a dangerous product, they are an
7      addictive product.  There is no such thing as a
8      safe cigarette.
9           Now, Dr. Cummings on cross-examination
10      testified, I asked him, in fact, Dr. Cummings, you
11      don't know whether it's even possible to achieve a
12      concentration of levulinic acid in tobacco that's
13      low enough to result in increased binding of
14      nicotine to the nicotinic receptors in the brain,
15      do you, sir?
16           And he said, "No."  Because you see the more
17      levulinic acids you have, the less binding effect
18      it has on the nicotine to the acetylcholine
19      receptors, and the lower it is, the inverse is
20      true, the greater the binding effect.
21           And he simply did not know that.  He doesn't
22      know at what level the levulinic acid has to be to
23      result in an increase of the binding effect.  And
24      that's very important.
25           You heard a lot about marketing to youth, 3235
1      marketing to people between the ages of 14 and 24.
2      Well, Mr. Ellis started smoking at age 18 or after.
3      Mrs. Ellis tells us that, that it was after he
4      graduated from high school.  I think she's in a
5      position to know.
6           They started dating when they were 16.  She
7      was a smoker before he was.  If he was smoking or
8      was attempting to smoke, he could have bummed a
9      cigarette from her.  But she never saw him smoke
10      until after he graduated at 18.
11           Barbara Dixon, longtime friend, who grew up
12      with the Ellises said it was after he graduated
13      from high school.
14           Martha Dukes, sister, said she first saw him
15      with a cigarette in his hand after he got married.
16      He got married in 1956.
17           Martha Jean Martin, who met them in the '60s,
18      that's the first time she saw him smoke.
19           The only person who has him smoking at the age
20      of 17, was Richard Harvey, who was in the first
21      grade at the time, and he's recounting something
22      that happened 60 years ago because the man is now
23      67 years old and said that he saw him smoke a
24      cigarette when he was in the first grade.  That's
25      the only evidence there is of him smoking prior to 3236
1      the time that he was 18 years old.
2           So to claim that he was smoking as a 12 or
3      13-year-old, as a teenager as opposed to as an
4      adult at the age of 18, is simply not supported in
5      the evidence.
6           We've heard a lot about advertising.  And
7      there is nothing illegal about advertising.  It's
8      legal to advertise cigarettes just like it is to
9      advertise other products.  There are other products
10      that are dangerous that were advertised.  There is
11      no evidence that Mr. Ellis began smoking because of
12      advertising, none whatsoever.
13           Dr. Cummings testified that the most
14      influential factor to start smoking is family and
15      friends who smoke.  If you've got a girlfriend or a
16      boyfriend or you've got some other friend or you've
17      got a parent who smokes, that's a much greater
18      predictor of who will begin smoking than
19      advertising.  Dr. Cummings testified to that
20      effect.  That's the most influential factor.
21           There is no evidence that he continued smoking
22      because of cigarette advertising.  None.  None
23      whatsoever.
24           Mrs. Ellis testified it was his decision to
25      start smoking, even though she was a smoker before 3237
1      he was, she said she didn't do anything to
2      influence him to start smoking, that the decision
3      to start smoking was his decision.
4           Now let's get back to Mr. Ellis and the issues
5      that you have to decide in this case.
6           And our position is that the plaintiff failed
7      to meet her burden of proof.  And remember the
8      plaintiff has the burden of proof on each and every
9      one of these issues.
10           Plaintiff has to prove class membership.  And
11      in order to do that, plaintiff has to prove medical
12      causation, addiction, and addiction causation.
13           Then the next issue, concealment, agreement to
14      conceal, the plaintiff has to prove that there was
15      something that was concealed from Mr. Ellis that
16      but for that information, he wouldn't have died of
17      what the plaintiff contends is a smoking-related
18      disease.  That's the plaintiff's burden.  And I'm
19      going to walk through each of those things right
20      now.
21           The first question that you will have on the
22      verdict form, "Do you find that Clarence C. Ellis
23      was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine and
24      that Mr. Ellis had lung cancer," that's a cancer
25      that started in the lung, "and if so, that his 3238
1      addiction was a legal cause of his lung cancer and
2      his death?"
3           In order to demonstrate that, the plaintiff
4      has to prove medical causation.  Number one, the
5      plaintiff has to prove that Clarence Ellis died
6      from lung cancer and it was caused by smoking.
7           Number two, the plaintiff has to prove that
8      Clarence Ellis was addicted to nicotine.
9           And then number three, even if he was
10      addicted, even if Clarence Ellis was addicted,
11      plaintiff must prove addiction was a legal cause of
12      Clarence Ellis's death.  We're going to walk
13      through the evidence on each and every one of those
14      issues.
15           Let's talk about medical causation.  Plaintiff
16      failed to prove that Mr. Ellis died from a primary
17      lung cancer caused by smoking.  It's not R.J.
18      Reynolds' burden to prove that he did not die of a
19      primary lung cancer, it's plaintiff's burden to
20      prove that he did.
21           The only board certified medical oncologist
22      specializing in the treatment of cancer, including
23      lung cancer, and who sees cancer patients on a
24      daily basis and has treated tens of thousands of
25      cancer patients was Dr. David Okun.  And Dr. David 3239
1      Okun said that the pathologic diagnosis was
2      generic.  To say that it's a large undifferentiated
3      carcinoma is a generic diagnosis.  It doesn't tell
4      you anything about where the cancer started.
5           He said the presentation and clinical course
6      were inconsistent with primary lung cancer.  And
7      presentation is how the symptoms that the patient
8      presented with to the doctor's office.
9           Mr. Ellis didn't have the signs or symptoms of
10      a primary lung cancer.  You remember Dr. Okun said
11      that if that were the case, he would have had
12      coughing, a certain kind and not the kind that you
13      would call a -- associated with COPD.  Said there
14      would be a cough that he would have.  He would have
15      wheezing.  He would have hemoptysis or coughing up
16      blood.  He would have those symptoms if, in fact,
17      he had a primary lung cancer.
18           He said if he had a primary lung cancer, it
19      would have been larger than this singular 1 1/2
20      centimeter nodule in his chest.  He said the
21      information from the medical workup was
22      insufficient to establish primary lung cancer, and
23      he said it wasn't the quantity of the number of
24      records, but the quality.
25           And what he meant by that was looking at the 3240
1      pathology, because you've got to look at it under
2      the microscope to determine what kind of cancer
3      cell it is, and then determine where the cancer
4      came from, and they were unable to do that based on
5      the pathology.
6           And let's look at some of the records.  Now,
7      Dr. Okun, one other thing before we leave Dr. Okun,
8      Dr. Okun said that you couldn't tell where the
9      cancer started.  And I believe plaintiff's counsel
10      said, well, they did all of these scans in the
11      abdominal region and the pelvic region and they
12      didn't see any masses.
13           Well, they did a bone scan and they missed the
14      mass in his spine.  Dr. Okun testified that these
15      scans aren't always accurate, that you can miss
16      things on these scans, and probably the best
17      evidence of that or illustration of it was when
18      they missed the mass in his spine when they did the
19      bone scan.  It was only later that they made a --
20      did subsequent scans and found the mass in his
21      back, at the cervical and thoracic regions of his
22      spine.
23           Now, Dr. Bilek prepared and signed these
24      records.  There are some other records in here that
25      have some inconsistent things on them that were 3241
1      prepared by other people that have Dr. Bilek signed
2      off on them.  But he prepared himself and signed
3      these records and in each of these instances, he
4      says "unknown primary, question, mark lung."
5           Now, this was the radiation oncologist who was
6      treating this patient.  Not someone who saw him on
7      one or two occasions but the person who was
8      treating his cancer.  And the radiation that he
9      administered to him was to that mass in his back.
10      At no time did he ever treat or administer
11      radiation to the nodule in his lung.  He treated
12      the mass in Mr. Ellis's back.
13           Now, what did Dr. Sheedy and McCoy have to
14      say?  Well, Dr. Sheedy, who is involved in
15      palliative care, he saw Mr. Ellis two times, but
16      there is only one note in the record, by
17      Dr. Sheedy.  He had no role in diagnosing Mr.
18      Ellis's cancer.  He decided whether Mr. Ellis
19      should undergo chemo.
20           And he's not certified in oncology, and then
21      he didn't pass the hematology exam.  That's no
22      knock on him, that's just a fact in terms of
23      qualifications, and those are the kinds of things
24      you are to take into account.
25           In that expert witness jury instruction it 3242
1      says you are to take into account the witness's
2      skill, knowledge, education, experience, and
3      training.  And so that goes to that in terms of
4      whether you credit that testimony or discredit it,
5      his qualifications have bearing on it.
6           Dr. McCoy involved in family practice handed
7      off Mr. Ellis to the other doctors in September of
8      1992.  He had ten-minute visits with him in
9      September and October.  There are no records of his
10      beyond October of 1992, and there is no evidence
11      about how he went about completing the death
12      certificate.
13           While we are talking about death certificates,
14      let me say a thing or two.  A death certificate is
15      not conclusive proof of the cause of death.  If
16      that were the case, we wouldn't have heard from all
17      these doctors in this case.  It's not conclusive.
18      That's just his opinion, Dr. McCoy, who is in
19      family practice and is not involved in oncology.
20      That is not his specialty.
21           Dr. Sheedy did not prove the plaintiff's
22      theory, he did no research on cancer causation in
23      individual patients.  He said I believe it was 80
24      percent of the people who have lung cancer are
25      smokers, but while that applies to a population of 3243
1      people, it doesn't necessarily apply to an
2      individual.  You have to judge an individual on
3      that individual -- on an individual basis.
4           He does not know the generally-accepted
5      scientific criteria for determining cancer
6      causation in an individual patient.  And this was
7      an individual patient.  We're talking about
8      Mr. Ellis.
9           This formula was a rather crude one, smoking
10      history of 34 years at two packs a day or two to
11      three packs a day plus lung cancer means that,
12      well, the cigarettes must have caused the lung
13      cancer.  Well, it's not that simple.
14           It's a lot more complicated than that, as
15      Dr. Okun testified, there are 140 different kinds
16      of cancer, and you have to look at cells.  All lung
17      cancers aren't the same kind of cell type.  So it's
18      a lot more complicated than just saying somebody
19      smoked, they got lung cancer, so the smoking must
20      have caused it.
21           And Dr. Sheedy was asked this question, "What
22      have you done to rule out the possibility that this
23      is a case of unknown primary?"  And his response
24      was, "I have done nothing.  I was not his treating
25      physician.  I was a consultant."  And this was read 3244
1      back to him and he agreed that that was read
2      correctly, that had been his testimony in a
3      deposition.
4           Let's look at Dr. McCoy.  Dr. McCoy testified
5      that Mr. Ellis did not have any other risk factors
6      for cancer, but then he turned around and he
7      admitted that family history of cancer was relevant
8      to an individual cancer incidence.
9           And we know from the evidence that Mr. Ellis's
10      mother died of uterine cancer at the age of 44 and
11      that his sister had both colon cancer and she also
12      had cervical cancer.  So he had that particular
13      risk factor.
14           Dr. Burns offered contradictory opinions on
15      the medical issue.  Dr. Burns explained that the
16      cancer in Mr. Ellis's lung spread when the tumor
17      broke through the lining and entered the
18      bloodstream.
19           He didn't mention anything about the lymph
20      system, which, as Dr. Okun pointed out, it would go
21      first to the hilar lymph nodes and the mediastinal
22      lymph nodes before it would go to any other part of
23      the body, and he didn't have any signs of enlarged
24      lymph nodes in those regions of his body.  So
25      that's a contraindication of a primary lung cancer. 3245
1           And then a second opinion on this, Dr. Burns,
2      said that Mr. Ellis's tumor was isolated and it did
3      not break through the lining of the lung.  It can't
4      be both things, but he gave conflicting views on
5      that.
6           The bottom line, plaintiff failed to prove by
7      a preponderance of the evidence, greater weight of
8      the evidence, that Mr. Ellis had a primary lung
9      cancer caused by smoking.
10           Now let's talk about addiction.  In order to
11      establish class membership, not only must plaintiff
12      prove that Mr. Ellis had a primary lung cancer
13      caused by smoking, it also has to prove that
14      Mr. Ellis was addicted to cigarettes containing
15      nicotine.
16           The only expert who came in this case to
17      testify who has expertise in substance abuse was
18      Dr. Jaffe.  A psychologist who came down.  He's
19      treated smokers for nicotine addiction for 30
20      years.  And while he hasn't published as much as
21      some of the other experts, he's spent a lot of time
22      treating patients, because that's how he spends his
23      time, treating patients.
24           He applied the American Psychiatric
25      Association diagnostic criteria to Mr. Ellis and 3246
1      found no clinically-significant impairment.  And
2      that's what you've got to do, that's the threshold
3      determination before you can get into those 11
4      factors that Mr. -- that Dr. Jaffe discussed that
5      are set out in the DSM-5.
6           The threshold determination is did the
7      substance cause the patient clinically-significant
8      impairment or distress.  And he didn't find signs
9      of it.  We'll talk about what did cause
10      clinically-significant impairment or distress to
11      Mr. Ellis.  It was the alcohol, it wasn't the
12      nicotine.
13           His opinion was that Mr. Ellis was not
14      addicted according to the Diagnostic Statistical
15      Manual of Mental Disorders, which is the reference
16      that people in that field use to diagnose substance
17      abuse in their patients in treating their patients.
18           Plaintiff's expert said he was addicted
19      basically because he smoked a lot.  Dr. Cummings
20      said he smoked a lot and he smoked early in the
21      morning, first cigarette within the first five
22      minutes of getting up, and so, therefore, under the
23      Fagerstrom test that he was addicted.
24           Dr. Burns said, well, he smoked a lot, he
25      smoked two to three packs over 34 years then he 3247
1      must be addicted.  Dr. Sheedy testified that he
2      applied a subjective method.
3           Said the man had discoloration on his fingers
4      and on his tongue and on his mouth, smoked two to
5      three packs a day for 30-some years, therefore,
6      he's addicted.  Well, it's not that simple, as
7      Dr. Jaffe pointed out.  It's a lot more complicated
8      than that.
9           Therefore, plaintiff failed to prove that
10      Mr. Ellis was addicted to cigarettes.
11           Next hurdle that plaintiff has to get over,
12      proving that addiction was a legal cause of
13      Clarence Ellis's death.  And here is the jury
14      instruction for class membership.
15           "An addiction to smoking cigarettes containing
16      nicotine is a legal cause of cancer and death if it
17      directly and in a natural and continuous sequence
18      produces or contributes substantially to producing
19      such cancer and death so that it can be reasonably
20      said that but for an addiction to cigarettes
21      containing nicotine, the cancer and death would not
22      have occurred."
23           But for.  That's what it means when something
24      is a substantial contributing factor.  It has to
25      rise to that level.  That but for the addiction, 3248
1      that he wouldn't have died.  And that's assuming
2      addiction.  So even if you found that he was
3      addicted, plaintiff would have to demonstrate that
4      but for the addiction, Mr. Ellis would not have
5      died.
6           And that assumes that he was unable to quit in
7      time to save his own life.  And we know that he was
8      capable of quitting, because millions and millions
9      of addicted, heavily-addicted smokers have quit,
10      they do quit.
11           Dr. David Burns, who has been involved in all
12      these Surgeon General's reports, came in here and
13      testified, he said millions and millions of smokers
14      who quit were heavily addicted to nicotine.
15           Dr. Cummings said 90 percent of the people --
16      well, he and Dr. Burns said 90 percent of the
17      people who quit were heavily addicted.  And they
18      both agree that millions of smokers quit cold
19      turkey.  In fact, 90 percent of them do.  Not only
20      are 90 percent of them heavily addicted, but 90
21      percent of them quit cold turkey.  But in order to
22      do that, you've got to be motivated.
23           Now, you heard some statistics during the
24      trial.  And I want to recap some of that now.
25           Between 1955 and 1965, 17.6 million people 3249
1      quit smoking.  Between 1964, the Surgeon General's
2      Report came out, and 1979, some 30 million people
3      kicked the habit.  And as of 2014, 60 million
4      people have quit.  There are more former smokers
5      than current smokers.
6           And just to illustrate the numbers, if you
7      were to put all those 60 million smokers who quit,
8      it would fill Doak Campbell Stadium 729 times,
9      that's how many people kicked the habit.  And 90
10      percent of them did it without the benefit of any
11      aids, cessation tools, they did it cold turkey.
12           Now, plaintiff has admitted that the acts of
13      Mr. Ellis relating to the duration and frequency of
14      his efforts to stop smoking were a partial legal
15      cause of Mr. Ellis's cancer and his death.
16      Plaintiff has admitted that.  That his acts
17      relating to the duration of his smoking and the
18      frequency of his efforts to stop smoking were a
19      partial legal cause of Mr. Ellis's death.
20           Now, Mrs. Ellis testified during the course of
21      the trial and when asked, "You believe it's his
22      fault for not quitting sooner and for not starting
23      to begin with, don't you?"  And she said yes, that
24      was his fault.  It wasn't the fault of R.J.
25      Reynolds that he started smoking or that he didn't 3250
1      quit sooner.  It was his fault.
2           Now, what does this admission mean, when you
3      break it down?  That Mr. Ellis knew that smoking
4      was dangerous, yet he continued to smoke.  He was
5      not confused about the dangers and addictiveness of
6      smoking.  Mr. Ellis had the ability to quit smoking
7      earlier.  And he could have tried harder to quit
8      smoking.  Mr. Ellis had the ability to quit smoking
9      at a time that would have prevented his death.
10           It comes down to this, did Mr. Ellis have the
11      ability to quit but chose to continue smoking?
12      Evidently, he did, because if you're saying that
13      he's partly at fault for not making a greater
14      effort to quit sooner, then he had the ability to
15      quit.
16           MR. SALES:  Object, Your Honor, that misstates
17      the plaintiff's admission.
18           THE COURT:  Overruled.
19           MR. PERSONS:  It means did he have the ability
20      to quit but chose to continue smoking, or did
21      nicotine control Mr. Ellis and leave him no choice
22      no matter how hard he tried, but to continue
23      smoking until his death?
24           And even their experts, Dr. Cummings and
25      Dr. Burns, said -- they used -- Dr. Cummings used 3251
1      the term "constrained choice".  And I remember
2      asking him, "Well, does the Surgeon General use
3      that term?"  He said, "No, it's something I made
4      up."
5           Constrained choice.  Even he didn't say that
6      the smoker had no choice.  He never said Mr. Ellis
7      had no choice.  Mr. Ellis would have to have no
8      choice in order to be compelled to the point that
9      addiction controlled him to the point that he
10      smoked until he died.
11           You can't say on the one hand, that he had the
12      ability to quit and was somewhat addicted but
13      somehow the addiction controlled him to the point
14      that he couldn't quit.
15           Dr. Cummings said a smoker is fully
16      responsible for making the choice to quit.  That's
17      plaintiff's expert.
18           A smoker is fully responsible, not partly
19      responsible, fully responsible for making the
20      choice to quit.  Mr. Ellis never made that choice.
21           Dr. Burns also said that smokers, including
22      addicted smokers, are responsible for their smoking
23      behavior.  Addicted smokers do not lose control
24      over their behavior.  That was his testimony.  And
25      so what was it about Mr. Ellis that was different 3252
1      from those 60 million people who quit?  Why is he
2      different than the 60 million who quit?
3           Were the cigarettes he was smoking more
4      addictive than the other cigarettes that the other
5      60 million people were smoking?  No.
6           Was Mr. Ellis's brain affected differently
7      than the smokers who quit?  No.
8           Was Mr. Ellis exposed to advertising that was
9      different than the people who quit?  No.
10           Was he exposed to tobacco company statements
11      different than the smokers who quit?  No.
12           Did Mr. Ellis smoke more or longer than the
13      smokers who quit?  No.
14           Was Mr. Ellis somehow different from
15      Mrs. Ellis, who chose to quit and successfully
16      quit?  No.
17           Did Mr. Ellis choose to continue smoking
18      because he liked it and did not want to quit?  Yes.
19           He enjoyed smoking.  There is nothing wrong
20      with that.  And we certainly don't impugn anything
21      by his character or that he's somehow wrong to do
22      that.  Of course not.  This is a free country.  If
23      you want to enjoy something and you can go into the
24      store and get it, that's your business.  In fact,
25      that was the view that Mr. Ellis took according to 3253
1      Mrs. Ellis.  "You tend to your business and I'll
2      tend to my business."
3           And the evidence is any smoker can quit.
4      There is nobody that's come into this courtroom and
5      testified that a smoker cannot quit.  None of these
6      experts have come in here and said that, well, a
7      smoker can't quit.
8           They say any smoker can quit.  Dr. Cummings
9      said, "Anyone who wants to quit can quit."
10      Dr. Burns said, "It's up to the smoker to continue
11      smoking or to make the decision to quit."
12           Now, some smokers just want to smoke.
13      Dr. Cummings, "Some smokers enjoy smoking and they
14      want to continue smoking."  Even some of the people
15      who would come in or call in on the help line when
16      he was working in New York, and he said, "Some
17      people would come in and they would say, well,
18      yeah, I want to, I want to quit, but they didn't
19      want to quit, they enjoyed it."
20           Dr. Sheedy said, "Some smokers have no desire
21      to stop smoking."
22           Dr. McCoy acknowledged that some smokers do
23      not want to quit.  And Dr. Jaffe, I think it was
24      one of the last questions he answered yesterday
25      afternoon said that even heavy smokers enjoy 3254
1      smoking.
2           I believe the question was, "Do you know
3      anyone or have you had a patient who smoked for 34
4      years, two to three packs a day, who did not enjoy
5      smoking?"  And he took a moment to think about it
6      and he said, "No, I've never had a patient who
7      presented with that history who did not enjoy
8      smoking.  Some smokers just want to smoke."
9           We know that Mr. Ellis made his own decisions.
10      An intelligent man, very determined man, extremely
11      hard working, described as a workaholic, strong
12      minded and strong-willed individual.  In the words
13      of I think it was Martha Dixon, either she or
14      Martha Jean Martin, said he had good old common
15      horse sense, or as what some of the folks used to
16      say just walking-around sense.
17           He was independent.  He would be more
18      persistent if someone told him something wouldn't
19      work.  If you told him -- you wanted to challenge
20      him, you would tell him that something that he had
21      proposed wouldn't work, and he would work harder
22      and demonstrate to you that it would work.  I
23      believe his nephew said that anything he put his
24      mind to, he could do it.
25           Now, we know he didn't want to quit smoking. 3255
1      We know that he enjoyed smoking.  He told people
2      that he did.  Mrs. Ellis did not believe Mr. Ellis
3      when he said he was going to quit.  She quit
4      smoking in the mid '70s for a year.  And then in
5      the early '80s, about 1981, she quit again.  And at
6      that point in time, she approached him and said,
7      "Well, you going to quit?"  He said, "Yeah."  But
8      she didn't believe him.
9           And then on another occasion, she approached
10      him about quitting and he said, "I'm not ready to
11      quit.  I'm not ready to quit."  He didn't say "I
12      can't quit.  It's too difficult to quit."  He said,
13      "I'm not ready to quit."
14           Now, Mrs. Ellis said that Mr. Ellis was aware
15      of the health risks when he tried to quit.  She
16      testified that Mr. Ellis attempted to quit 10 to 15
17      times over the course of their married life
18      together.  Some of these quit attempts would last
19      two hours, some of them would last as long as two
20      days.
21           You heard a lot of evidence about people
22      telling Mr. Ellis to quit smoking.  When one of his
23      sisters, I believe it was Sally Opal Harrison, told
24      him that if he continued to smoke cigarettes, he
25      would get cancer, he shrugged his shoulders. 3256
1           When his daughters urged him to quit smoking,
2      he ignored them.  When others approached him about
3      quitting, he would point to articles on the
4      refrigerator, and basically tell them to leave him
5      alone.  Mrs. Ellis described it as to "stop messing
6      with me."
7           People would mess with him about his smoking,
8      that's what he would do.  All evidence of the fact
9      that he did not want to quit.  You know he didn't
10      want to quit.
11           Going back to Mrs. Ellis's testimony, "Because
12      smoking was his business, wasn't it?
13           "That's correct.
14           "And he felt that smoking was not their
15      business; right?"
16           Answer was, "Right."
17           Question:  "He was the type of person who was
18      of the opinion that you tend to your business and
19      I'll tend to mine?"
20           Answer:  "Yes."
21           He made his own smoking decisions.  Didn't
22      want people to bother him about it.  And that was
23      his prerogative, that was his prerogative.
24           We know that he was not motivated to quit, and
25      we know that that's an essential ingredient in 3257
1      order to quit.  You have to be motivated to quit
2      and you have to be persistent about it.
3           Dr. Jaffe told us that "Motivation is
4      critically important to quitting.  Many smokers do
5      not want to quit and try to quit only because their
6      family members are bugging them."  I think he
7      called that external motivation.
8           "Motivated smokers seek help from others when
9      they try to quit."  And just because you are a
10      quiet person doesn't mean that you don't seek help
11      trying to quit.  There is no evidence that
12      Mr. Ellis ever sought any help trying to quit
13      smoking.  Mr. Ellis's behavior did not show a
14      desire to quit.
15           Now, when Mr. Ellis was motivated to quit
16      drinking, he did.  His family members acknowledged
17      that he was addicted to alcohol and it was a
18      problem for his family and for his marriage.  He
19      had problems at work because of drinking.
20           And when Mrs. Ellis -- when Mrs. Ellis gave
21      him an ultimatum about his drinking and told him to
22      quit drinking or she would leave him, at that
23      point, Mr. Ellis had sufficient motivation to go
24      into the detox facility for 30 days, and when he
25      left there, he never took another drop of alcohol. 3258
1      That's motivation to quit.
2           And when Dr. Jaffe was talking about
3      substantial impairment or distress, he said it had
4      to rise to the level of something that would affect
5      your relationship with your family, affect your
6      relationship with your job.  And that's what
7      alcohol did to Mr. Ellis.  That's substantial
8      impairment or distress, a clear illustration of
9      substantial impairment or distress.
10           So let's contrast and compare the two.
11      Motivated to quit smoking, question mark.
12      Motivated to quit drinking.  The smoking, he
13      recognized the risks.  For the drinking, he
14      recognized the impact on family and his work.
15           Smoking, he didn't seek any assistance from
16      anyone.  For the drinking, he sought medical
17      assistance.
18           Smoking, he quit from two hours to two days.
19      For drinking, he went to a 30-day inpatient rehab
20      facility.
21           He was not motivated to quit smoking.  Once he
22      got the ultimatum from Mrs. Ellis, he was motivated
23      to quit drinking.  He decided to continue smoking,
24      and he decided to give up drinking.
25           And so the bottom line is once he made a 3259
1      commitment to do something, he followed through on
2      it and he did it.  He never made a commitment to
3      quit smoking, and he didn't.  And that's not
4      because of addiction.  That's because he made the
5      decision he did not want to give up the pleasures
6      of smoking.
7           The plaintiff failed to prove that Mr. Ellis's
8      addiction was the legal cause of his death, that he
9      was somehow robbed of the ability to quit smoking
10      because of addiction.
11           All right, let's see here.  Can you help me
12      with this?  This is a little fuzzy.
13           MR. SMITH:  Yes.
14           MR. PERSONS:  Okay.  I hope everybody --
15      everybody can't see it.
16           All right.
17           And the first question on the verdict form,
18      "Do you find that Clarence C. Ellis was addicted to
19      cigarettes containing nicotine and if Mr. Ellis had
20      lung cancer, and if so, that his addiction was a
21      legal cause of his lung cancer and death?"  I
22      submit to you the answer to that is no.
23           Before I turn to the next topic, let me say
24      something.  We don't dispute that Mr. Ellis told
25      his wife that he wanted to quit smoking for health 3260
1      reasons and that he made an effort to, but he
2      didn't have the motivation to follow through and to
3      quit.  He wasn't motivated to quit.
4           The next question, question number 2 on the
5      verdict form, "Was R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's
6      concealment or omission of material information
7      about the health effects or addictive nature of
8      smoking cigarettes, or both, a legal cause of
9      Clarence Ellis's death?"
10           Number 3, "Was R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's
11      agreement with other cigarette manufacturers and
12      corporations to conceal or omit information
13      regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their
14      addictive nature a legal cause of Clarence C.
15      Ellis's death?"
16           The evidence demonstrates that nothing
17      Reynolds concealed from Mr. Ellis or agreed with
18      others to conceal was a legal cause of Mr. Ellis's
19      death.  And I'll walk through that, we'll turn to
20      that now.
21           In order to meet her burden of proof on this
22      issue, the plaintiff has to prove that there was
23      something that was concealed or that Reynolds in
24      concert with others agreed to conceal that was a
25      legal cause of Mr. Ellis's death, that had 3261
1      Mr. Ellis known the -- but for this information,
2      Mr. Ellis would not have died.
3           And here is the jury instruction.  "Fraud by
4      concealment or omission is a legal cause of cancer
5      and death if it directly and in a natural and
6      continuous sequence produces or contributes
7      substantially to producing cancer and death so that
8      it can reasonably be said that, but for such fraud
9      by concealment or omission, the cancer and death
10      would not have occurred."
11           So let's look at it this way.  Because it
12      can't be both ways.  Starting in the 1970s,
13      Mr. Ellis tried to quit smoking because he believed
14      it was bad for his health.  Mrs. Ellis tells us
15      this.  That was her testimony.
16           It's either that or starting in the 1970s,
17      Mr. Ellis put articles on the refrigerator because
18      he believed smoking was safe.  We know why he put
19      the articles on the refrigerator, not because he
20      believed smoking was safe.
21           At the same time she's saying he's going 10 to
22      15 times trying to quit for health reasons, that's
23      inconsistent.  So how do you reconcile the
24      inconsistency?  He put the articles on the
25      refrigerator so people would leave him alone and 3262
1      stop bothering him about smoking, that's why he put
2      the articles up there.
3           And we know very little about those articles.
4      Very little about the content of those articles.
5      For one thing, we never saw one of them during the
6      plaintiff's case.  Not that we would expect them to
7      have those things around all these years, but you
8      can locate old newspaper articles.  They located
9      some.  But not one that Mrs. Ellis identified as
10      having been on the refrigerator.
11           We don't know when these articles were
12      published.  Ms. Ellis didn't remember what they
13      said.  We don't know any details about those
14      articles.
15           And Dr. Jaffe said they were not a crutch but
16      a shield, because he used them to get people off
17      his back about smoking.
18           We know some things about the dangers and
19      addictiveness of tobacco.  And we know that they
20      were no secret.  People have been saying for
21      centuries that tobacco is harmful to your health.
22      It's been known for centuries that once you start
23      using tobacco, it can be difficult to give it up.
24           And people have been talking about tobacco
25      being addictive and causing cancer for over 150 3263
1      years.  Dr. Burns told us these things.  That was
2      Dr. Burns's testimony, one of the plaintiff's
3      experts in this case.
4           You can go back to the Counterblaste Of
5      Tobacco back in the 1600s when King James, same
6      King James associated with the King James version,
7      is talking about the health hazards of smoking.
8           Dr. Cummings admitted that studies about
9      smoking and lung cancer received coverage in
10      newspapers, magazines, and scientific journals by
11      the early 1950s.
12           So a lot of these confidential memos that were
13      inside the companies about the scientific research,
14      that scientific research that Dr. Rodgman was
15      looking at, a lot of that scientific research was
16      the same research that got covered in newspapers,
17      magazines, and scientific journals.
18           And, in fact, Dr. Cummings at one point said
19      that sometimes the results of these research would
20      be in the popular press before it was released to
21      the scientific community because somebody would
22      leak it.  So it was in the information environment.
23      It wasn't hidden from anybody.
24           In the 1950s, the public health authorities
25      began providing information about the dangers of 3264
1      smoking.  About the dangers of smoking.  That's
2      Dr. Cummings' testimony.  And we know as early as
3      1915, the Surgeon General of the United States was
4      saying that smoking is addictive.  Didn't have to
5      wait until 1988.  That wasn't the first time the
6      Surgeon General had reached that conclusion.
7           The first time was back in 1915 when they
8      studied the garment workers in New York and they
9      wanted to find out why they had a higher incidence
10      of illness and disease, and they linked it to
11      smoking, and that was what the Surgeon General
12      reported, smoking is addictive.  And that's almost
13      a hundred years ago.
14           Now, I want to go decade by decade and talk
15      about Mr. Ellis.
16           Put it over here.  Let me move this out of the
17      way.
18           We know that he was born in 1936 in Moultrie,
19      Georgia.  Started school in the '40s, and meets
20      Mrs. Ellis in 1948.  Going to talk about the first
21      13 years of his life.  We know that he had public
22      warnings about cancer and addiction, that was in
23      the public realm of knowledge.
24           We talked about the Reader's Digest articles,
25      we talked about TIME magazine articles, some of 3265
1      those newspaper articles.  There was warnings in
2      popular culture.  One of the things was this song
3      that came out in 1947 by Tex Williams.  And we know
4      that his parents forbid their children to smoke, so
5      we know that was going on in the household.
6           So let's look at some of what was going on
7      prior to the '50s, media warnings about the dangers
8      of smoking.
9           Reader's Digest was the most popular magazine
10      in the United States of America in the '40s, '50s,
11      and '60s, and Reader's Digest was very
12      anti-tobacco.  They hated smoking.  And they
13      refused to accept any advertising from the tobacco
14      companies, absolutely refused to.  And they carried
15      articles warning the public about the dangers of
16      smoking.
17           The scientific research that would find its
18      way into the scientific journals, they took it and
19      put it in form that laypeople could understand and
20      put it in their magazine.  And here are just a
21      sampling of some of the articles.
22           This is 1935, "On Giving Up Smoking."  1940,
23      "I Quit Smoking, Cooper's Last Stand."  1924,
24      November, "Does Tobacco Injure the Human Body?"
25      And here is an excerpt from that issue of Reader's 3266
1      Digest.  "Tobacco is injurious to the human body.
2      Its use sometimes induces cancer."  "Sometimes
3      induces cancer."  And then here is TIME magazine,
4      March 7, 1938 "Coffin nails", another name for
5      cigarettes.
6           And even though Mrs. Ellis didn't remember
7      receiving the Reader's Digest, information in the
8      Reader's Digest would be in the realm of discussion
9      that people would have because people talked to
10      each other about things.
11           It certainly wasn't a secret if it's in the
12      Reader's Digest.
13           Here is an article in a magazine called
14      Reader's Scope, 1946, "Cigarettes Cause Cancer?"
15      "Some years ago Roffo and the chemist Luchetta
16      isolated a substance called benzopyrene.
17      Benzopyrene, they report, is present in and can be
18      isolated from tobacco tar, which is produced by the
19      heat in the burning end of a cigarette, cigar or
20      pipe, and benzopyrene has the lethal power to start
21      cancer.  It is a cancer-producing substance, a
22      carcinogen."
23           This is in 1946.  So it's no secret that
24      cigarettes and other forms of tobacco including
25      pipes and cigars contain carcinogens, 3267
1      cancer-causing chemicals, and that's in the late --
2      that's in 1946 in Reader's Scope.  No secret.
3           There is no question that the information was
4      pervasive throughout the country, information about
5      the dangers and addictive nature of smoking and it
6      made its way into the popular culture.
7           When something gets into the popular culture,
8      it's widespread, especially when something becomes
9      a number one song in the whole United States of
10      America, top of the charts, and stayed there for a
11      long time.  Mr. Ellis used to sing this song.
12           (Video clip played as follows:)
13           SINGER:  Now, I'm a feller with a heart of
14      gold,
15           The ways of a gentleman I've been told,
16           The kind of feller that wouldn't even harm a
17      flea.
18           But if me and a certain character met,
19           The guy that invented the cigarette,
20           I'd murder that son of a gun in the first
21      degree.
22           Now, it ain't cause that I don't smoke myself.
23           I don't reckon they hinder your health.
24           I've smoked them all my life and I ain't dead
25      yet. 3268
1           But nicotine slaves are all the same,
2           At a pettin' party or a poker game,
3           Everything's got to stop while they have that
4      cigarette.
5           Smoke, smoke, smoke, that cigarette.
6           Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to
7      death.
8           Tell Saint Peter at the Golden Gate that you
9      hates to make him wait,
10           But you've just gotta have another cigarette.
11           (Video clip stopped.)
12           MR. PERSONS:  Thank you.
13           Got the '50s?
14           Thank you, sir.  All right.  Let's look at the
15      1950s.  And we'll look at what's going on with
16      Mr. Ellis and what's going on in the United States.
17      Wynder Graham studies 1953, that's where they
18      painted the backs of the mice, they shaved the
19      backs of the mice and painted the tar from smoke
20      condensate on them and developed tumors.  That was
21      covered in LIFE magazine.
22           The first tobacco lawsuit was in 1954, so
23      people had enough information about the hazards of
24      smoking to start bringing suits.
[#DELETED ONJECTION DIALOGUE#]
2           MR. PERSONS:  That's right.  Technology.
3           So anyway, lawsuits and Dr. Cummings testified
4      about special projects that were conducted to
5      defend lawsuits.  And at least special projects
6      that were funded by the Tobacco Industry Research
7      Committee.
8           Mr. Ellis graduates from high school in 1954,
9      starts smoking after the age of 18, after he turned
10      18, he gets married in 1956.  So what's going on in
11      the United States with respect to smoking and
12      health at that time?  We know that between 1954,
13      after the mouse skin painting studies came out in
14      '53, people started to quit smoking.  And they
15      started quitting by the millions.
16           Between 1954 and 1964, 17 million Americans
17      quit smoking.  We know that there were public
18      warnings about cancer and addiction during this
19      era.  I'm going to talk about some of it.  We know
20      there were warnings in the popular culture, in
21      music, and in literature, about the dangers of
22      smoking.
23           Yet during this time, we know that Mr. Ellis
24      made no effort to quit smoking, at a time when
25      millions of people were giving it up, beginning in 3274
1      1954, he was taking it up.  We know this.  That's
2      the 1950s era.
3           We know in the 1950s, Reader's Digest
4      continued its mantra against smoking and warning
5      the public about the dangers of smoking.  January
6      1950 Reader's Digest, "How harmful are cigarettes?"
7      December 1952, "The growing horror of lung cancer."
8      In fact, the article is entitled "Cancer By the
9      Carton."
10           Nothing could be more graphic, nothing could
11      be more explicit about the dangers, the deadly
12      nature of cigarette smoking than cancer by the
13      carton.  In other words, you buy a carton of
14      cigarettes, you're buying a carton of cancer risk.
15      That's what it says, "Cancer by the carton."  It's
16      no secret.
17           "The growing horror of lung cancer," Reader's
18      Digest March 1959.  TIME magazine, December 22nd,
19      1952, "Smoking and cancer."  TIME magazine 1965,
20      "Smoking and cancer."  Remind you, this is at a
21      time when there were -- you didn't have any
22      internet.  People tended to read a lot of print
23      media.  That's how you got your news.  There were
24      only three networks, ABC, NBC, and CBC.  People
25      read papers.  Most major cities had a morning paper 3275
1      and an evening paper.
2           And people read magazines, because most folks
3      didn't have a color television, and the only way
4      you would see something in color would be to look
5      in a magazine to see it.  And that's how you kept
6      abreast of events.
7           And by the time it reaches the magazines and
8      newspapers, it is widely disseminated.  It is
9      certainly no secret.
10           We talked about this, I won't belabor it, but
11      this big magazine with these graphic images of
12      these mice with tumors on their backs after being
13      painted with the tar from cigarette smoke.
14           Mr. Ellis and Mrs. Ellis are living in
15      Moultrie in the 1950s.  And so we went to the
16      Moultrie Observer to see what kinds of information
17      was given to the citizens of Colquitt County,
18      Georgia, in the 1950s, and this is what we find.
19      These are headlines, it's not something buried
20      somewhere in the paper from some unidentified
21      source about taking a contrary position to what's
22      in the headline.  This is a headline.
23           And there was a thing at a time in this
24      country called newspaper boxes.  I think they've
25      become obsolete now.  But there was a newspaper 3276
1      machine.  And you would put a coin in it and you
2      would get a newspaper out of it.
3           And the newspapers would be folded, and you
4      would see the headline, and hence the term above
5      the fold, because you could walk by it and you'd
6      see the headline and make a decision about whether
7      you wanted to buy the page or not.  These are
8      headlines.  "Cigarette smokers die sooner, the
9      American Cancer Society says."
10           "Do cigarettes add to the cancer danger?"
11      That's another article, December 1955, in the
12      Moultrie Observer.  Atlanta paper, "Bears report on
13      cigarettes."  They picked up something from the
14      Atlanta Constitution in Atlanta and they
15      republished it in the Moultrie paper about the link
16      between cigarettes and cancer.
17           "Cancer group cites" -- I mean -- "Cancer
18      Group Cites Cigarette Hazards", that's 1954 {sic}
19      in Moultrie.
20           Here is Dr. Cummings, plaintiff's expert, "By
21      1954, virtually everyone knew that smoking could
22      cause disease, didn't they, sir?"
23           Answer:  "Knew and heard I think are the same.
24      They knew it by 1954."
25           That's his testimony.  It's no secret.  The 3277
1      public health leaders, the Surgeon General at the
2      time was Leroy Burney, testified before Congress,
3      and so did John Heller, the director of the
4      National Cancer Institute.  Dr. Leroy Burney said,
5      "Our position is that we have informed the public
6      through the excellent coverage of the press, radio,
7      and TV."
8           Dr. John Heller said, "Newspapers, radio, TV,
9      and other media have done an excellent job covering
10      this problem, and a very objective job.  This is an
11      exceedingly valuable way of informing the public."
12           These were people who were there in real time,
13      not looking back, not with the benefit of 20/20
14      hindsight or doing a retrospective of people who
15      were there on the ground.  People whose job it was,
16      the responsibility it was to protect the public
17      health and get out this message and this is what
18      they're saying at that time in 1957 in testimony
19      before congress.
20           Reverend Billy Graham had a column in the
21      Moultrie Observer called My Answer.  And here's
22      what he said in 1959 in October in the Moultrie
23      paper.
24           "The medical profession has done an excellent
25      job in alerting the American public to the dangers 3278
1      of smoking.  A multitude of magazine articles and
2      medical reports have established the relationship
3      of the habit with the occurrence of lung cancer."
4      He made in abundantly clear that the American
5      public had been duly alerted to the dangers of
6      smoking.
7           Thank you, sir.
8           That brings us to the 1960s.  1960, the
9      Ellises are still living in Moultrie.  Their first
10      child is born in 1960 and that would be Tammy.
11      Their daughter Pamela is born in 1963.  We know
12      that in 1964, the Surgeon General's Report on
13      smoking caused -- the link between smoking and lung
14      cancer in men came out, and that was widely
15      covered.
16           That was the most widely covered health news
17      in the history of the country.  It was huge, huge
18      news?  It made the front page of all the major
19      newspapers.  It was covered on all three of the
20      television networks.  It was on the radio.  It was
21      widely covered in the press, in the media.
22           We know that by 1964, 17 million Americans had
23      quit smoking.  The first warning label went on a
24      pack of cigarettes in 1966.  President Johnson
25      signed the legislation in the summer of 1965. 3279
1      Their daughter Kimberly was born in 1966.
2           And beginning in the late '60s, his daughters
3      Pamela and Tammy started to get on Mr. Ellis about
4      his smoking.
5           Between 1966, after the warning label went on,
6      to 1970, 13 million smokers quit.  That's the most,
7      that's the highest number of quitters in a
8      four-year period in the history of our country.  It
9      hadn't happened before nor since, that many people
10      quit.
11           Now, when Dr. Cummings was on the stand and
12      Dr. Burns, they want to say it was a caution label
13      as opposed to a warning label.  But it had the
14      effect of warning people about the dangers of
15      smoking, because so many of them quit.  So if there
16      was a mixed message, it wasn't very effective,
17      because people were quitting in huge, huge numbers.
18           During the '60s, the public warnings about
19      smoking and cancer continued.  There were continued
20      warnings in the popular press.  Yet during this
21      era, there was no effort to quit smoking by
22      Mr. Ellis.
23           And significant development in 1962, even
24      though he's living in Moultrie, he goes to work for
25      the Florida Publishing Company.  And so access to 3280
1      news, delivering the news.
2           He started working at Florida Publishing
3      Company in 1962.  We know that he was an avid
4      reader of newspapers and magazines.  He watched the
5      nightly news on television.  We talked about the
6      Surgeon General's Report, which concluded that
7      "Cigarette smoking is causally related to lung
8      cancer in men."
9           That was the conclusion.  That's 1964.  1964,
10      Mr. Ellis was 28 years old.  He's fully grown.
11      Father of two daughters.  And here is what the --
12      Harry Reasoner had to say about the Surgeon
13      General's Report.
14           (Video clip played as follows:)
15           MR. REASONER:  In this kind of a country, it
16      comes down to you, whether you like it or not.  No
17      one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is
18      now quite clear that no one is going to tell him
19      it's good for him, either.  The decision is his,
20      the decision and the health that may depend on it.
21      This is Harry Reasoner, good night.
22           (Video clip stopped.)
23           MR. PERSONS:  Here is the coverage in the
24      Moultrie Observer.  "Government panel sees
25      smoking-disease danger."  And in that article, 3281
1      "Smoking cigarettes is a health hazard that calls
2      for corrective action and is a major cause of lung
3      cancer and other death-dealing disease."
4           It's no secret.
5           And here is the 1966 warning:  "Cigarette
6      smoking may be hazardous to your health."  And
7      Mrs. Ellis testified that she was sure Mr. Ellis
8      saw this warning and was not surprised by it.
9      She's in the best position to know that it didn't
10      come as any surprise to him.
11           Show the public service announcement.
12           (Video clip played as follows:)
13           SPEAKER:  We receive many warnings in our
14      life, and sometimes they can save our life.
15           This message is brought to you by the American
16      Cancer Society.
17           (Video clip stopped.)
18           MR. PERSONS:  These public service
19      announcements were rampant during this era
20      informing the public about the dangers of smoking
21      and particularly the link between cigarette smoking
22      and cancer.
23           Some more warnings from the local media.
24      Moultrie Observer, where he lived.  The Florida
25      Times-Union paper that he worked for. 3282
1      "Smoking-related diseases killing at a higher rate,
2      public health service reports."
3           "Government panel sees smoking-disease
4      danger," that's in 1964.
5           "Cancer toll rise blamed on smoking."  That's
6      The Florida Times-Union 1969.
7           "Cigarette smoking held grave hazard to health
8      in the United States.  One pack a day doubles your
9      chances of death, expert says."
10           "'64 report on hazards of smoking backed up."
11           Then you've got Dr. Daniel Horn who said that
12      "You could stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is
13      dangerous' at the top of your lungs and you would
14      not be telling anyone anything they did not already
15      know."
16           And this is something he said in November of
17      1968.  "You would not be telling anyone anything
18      they did not already know."  So the word was out
19      there.  And these public service announcements were
20      very personal.  Some of them were extremely
21      personal, accounts from people who had developed
22      smoking-related disease, who were dying, warning
23      others to give up smoking.
24           (Video clip played as follows:)
25           MR. TALMAN:  This is the house we live in. 3283
1      This is Billy.  He's pretty handy to have around.
2      Steve, home from college.  Barbie, looking after
3      her brother Timmy.  Debbie, who will soon graduate
4      from high school.  Susan, our youngest.  And my
5      wife, Peggy, who looks after all of us.  And that's
6      me, Bill Talman, with a friend of mine you might
7      recognize.
8           You know, I didn't really mind losing those
9      courtroom battles, but I'm in a battle right now I
10      don't want to lose at all, because if I lose it, it
11      means losing my wife and those kids you just met.
12      I've got lung cancer.
13           So take some advice about smoking and losing
14      from someone who has been doing both for years.  If
15      you don't smoke, don't start.  If you do smoke,
16      quit.  Don't be a loser.
17           (Video clip stopped.)
18           MR. PERSONS:  Pretty powerful message from
19      Bill Talman, and that was a very, very popular
20      television show, Perry Mason, back in that era.
21           We'll turn now to the '70s.
22           Thank you, Mr. Smith.
23           All right, we know in 1970, the second warning
24      label goes on.  Also in 1970, 38 percent of US male
25      smokers have kicked the habit.  1971, television 3284
1      advertising for tobacco ads banned on TV and on
2      radio.  1971, that's when the Ellises first moved
3      to Florida.
4           1972, there were warnings put in the billboard
5      advertisements and the magazine advertisements,
6      newspaper ads for cigarettes.  In the mid '70s,
7      Mrs. Ellis quit smoking for one year.
8           In 1977, we know they had the Great American
9      Smokeout which was a nationwide effort, campaign to
10      get people to quit smoking for a day in hopes that
11      they would continue refraining from smoking and
12      kick the habit.
13           In 1978, the Ellises had moved to Tallahassee.
14      And in 1978, '79, Mr. Ellis catches his daughter
15      Pamela smoking and sets her straight.
16           Now, between 1965 and 1979, 30 million people
17      quit smoking.  The Surgeon General's Report comes
18      out in '64, beginning of '75, to '79, 30 million
19      quit.  Public warnings about cancer and addiction
20      continue.  Mr. Ellis gets warnings from his family
21      about smoking.  And there is a question about just
22      how motivated he was to quit.
23           And so now we'll look at some of the
24      information that was coming out there in the '70s.
25           This warning, "The Surgeon General has 3285
1      determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to
2      your health" came out in -- this was in the '70s.
3      And we know that Mr. Ellis saw this warning because
4      his daughter Tammy made sure that Mr. Ellis was
5      aware of this warning.
6           And here is a -- another public service
7      announcement, with a father and daughter, and the
8      daughter is warning the father about the dangers of
9      smoking.
10           (Video clip played as follows:)
11           DAUGHTER:  My father smoked so much he smelled
12      of it, I mean his face, his hair, his clothes.
13      Everything had that yucky smell.  And he was always
14      coughing.
15           FATHER:  Sorry, but that's the way it was.
16           DAUGHTER:  I worried about him, because in
17      school we learned about what cigarettes could do to
18      your lungs.
19           FATHER:  She sure let me and my lungs know.
20           DAUGHTER:  So one day I wrote to the Lung
21      Association for help, and they sent me this free
22      information about how to quit smoking.
23           FATHER:  I didn't think it would help, but I
24      promised to try.
25           DAUGHTER:  It wasn't easy. 3286
1           FATHER:  The understatement of the year.
2           DAUGHTER:  But he quit.
3           FATHER:  I really did.
4           DAUGHTER:  And if he can.
5           FATHER:  You can.  But remember, it was tough.
6           DAUGHTER:  Lung disease is tougher.  So if you
7      know someone who smokes, write to your Lung
8      Association for help.  Whether it's smoking, air
9      pollution, or any lung problem, your Lung
10      Association cares about every breath you take.
11           FATHER:  Take it from me, they really do.
12           (Video clip stopped.)
13           MR. PERSONS:  Again, just one of many public
14      service announcements that were shown on television
15      during that time.
16           And the media, print media continued to cover
17      this subject.  And publicizing the research.  Here
18      is Dr. Ochsner stressing the perils of tobacco.
19      The Florida Times-Union, "Cancer, a disease of
20      terror and hope."
21           Tallahassee Democrat, "Ten commandments to
22      prevent cancer.  Number one, don't smoke."  Surgeon
23      General warns "we're killing ourselves" with
24      smoking.  Tallahassee Democrat, 1979.  Florida
25      Times-Union, 1970, "Stop smoking clinic set by 3287
1      cancer unit."
2           They felt they'd done a good job of informing
3      the public about the dangers of smoking.  And so
4      the public health officials started moving toward
5      efforts to get people to quit, and so that became
6      the focus, how do we get people to quit smoking?
7      Now we've told them, we broadcast the dangers of
8      smoking, now let's focus on how to get people to
9      quit and directing them to resources to stop
10      smoking.
11           "Cancer unit sets clinic on smoking."  That's
12      The Florida Times-Union.  "Quit smoking clinic to
13      tell you how and why to quit."  "No-smoking class
14      begins Monday."  That's the Tallahassee Democrat,
15      that's March of 1979.
16           Mr. Ellis is living in Tallahassee at the
17      time.  But there is no evidence that he attended
18      any of these no-smoking classes or other smoking
19      cessation sessions.  Forums here to show how to
20      quit smoking.
21           If you have any sincere desire to quit or you
22      are motivated to quit, you can go and avail
23      yourself of that.
24           Here we have The Florida Times-Union.  We've
25      got the Lung Association launching a new 3288
1      antismoking campaign.  And "Jacksonville firms,"
2      including the Florida Times-Union, "cooperating
3      with the Lung Association and promoting the program
4      among their employees to get them to stop smoking."
5           So his employers urging him and his coworkers
6      to stop, employees of The Florida Times-Union were
7      urged to quit smoking, they had an antismoking
8      campaign they were conducting.
9           Now we look at the decade of the '80s.
10           All right, let's look at the 1980s.  1980 to
11      1993.
12           Mr. Ellis is continuing to work at the Florida
13      Publishing Company.  In 1985, rotating warnings go
14      on the packs of cigarettes.  By 1985 also, 42
15      million smokers have quit smoking.  We know that
16      the public warnings about cancer and addiction
17      continue.  Mr. Ellis gets warnings from his family
18      members.  There is still a question about
19      motivation to quit.  In 1992, he's diagnosed with
20      cancer.  So we'll be discussing those items at this
21      time.
22           Here are the rotating warnings.  And they
23      would appear an equal number of times on each
24      cigarette product in the course of a year.
25           And so you've got "Smoking causes lung cancer, 3289
1      heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate
2      pregnancy.  Smoking by pregnant women may result in
3      fetal injury, premature birth and low birth weight.
4      Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide.  Quitting
5      smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your
6      health."  So the benefits of quitting are set out
7      on that warning, one of the four that appeared in
8      1985.
9           Dr. Burns testified that the anti-smoking
10      campaign that began with the release of the 1964
11      Surgeon General's Report has been a major success,
12      one of the most profound health accomplishments in
13      the last century.  He said that by 1989, the public
14      health community had achieved more success with
15      tobacco addiction than with addictions to alcohol
16      and hard drugs.  By 1985, almost half of all living
17      men who had ever smoked had quit.
18           And so in the words of Dr. Burns, the campaign
19      had been a major success.  The anti-smoking
20      campaign he described as a major success.  And we
21      can just look at the numbers.
22           By 1954, everyone knew that smoking causes
23      disease, according to -- and that's according to
24      Dr. Cummings, he testified to that effect.  1957,
25      the Surgeon General, the public was informed 3290
1      through excellent coverage of press and radio and
2      TV about the dangers of smoking.
3           1964, when the Surgeon General's Report comes
4      out, and between '55 and '65, 17.6 million people
5      quit.  By 1965, 31 percent of male smokers had
6      quit.  Warning label goes on in 1966.
7           And 1968, this is -- Dr. Heller says, "You
8      could stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is
9      dangerous'" -- Daniel Horn, I'm sorry, "You could
10      stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is dangerous'
11      at the top of your lungs and you would not be
12      telling anyone anything they did not already know."
13           Warning label is changed in 1970 to say
14      "Smoking is hazardous to your health."  Warnings in
15      all the advertising in 1972.  And in 1975, more
16      Americans knew smoking was dangerous than knew the
17      name of the president of the United States of
18      America.
19           So the psychological crutch didn't stop
20      millions of people from quitting smoking.
21           Dr. Cummings was asked this question during
22      the course of this trial, said, "Perhaps it was
23      unclear."  I said:  "Notwithstanding that
24      psychological crutch," that he had been talking
25      about, "for a 15-year period, an average of 5,000 3291
1      to 6,000 people quit a day; right?"
2           And he admitted that, yes, that was true, that
3      notwithstanding the psychological crutch that he
4      had been testifying about, people continued to
5      quit, and they quit in huge numbers.
6           So warnings, very specific warnings, back to
7      Mr. Ellis in particular, we know that he got
8      warnings, word of mouth warnings.  We know that he
9      was described as being someone with common sense.
10      We know he got warnings from family members.  We.
11           Know he was -- he read newspapers and
12      magazines and watched the TV news so he got
13      warnings from the mass media.  We know he got
14      warnings from the popular culture.  We know he got
15      warnings from the federal and state government and
16      regulatory agencies, the public health groups.  We
17      know he got warnings from the American Lung
18      Association and Cancer Society, we know because we
19      have seen these public service announcements and
20      pieces in the newspapers.
21           Your Honor, do you want to take a break?
22           THE COURT:  Yes.  Why don't we take a
23      20-minute break, and then defense can complete its
24      close and then we'll have the last rebuttal close
25      of the plaintiff, and then we'll go to the jury. 3292
1      Why don't we make it a 15-minute break.
2           MR. PERSONS:  Okay.
3           THE COURT:  We'll be back about five till.
4           MR. PERSONS:  Thank you.
5           THE COURT:  Okay.
6           (The jury left the courtroom.)
7           (Recess taken from 2:42 p.m. to 2:51 p.m.)
8           THE BAILIFF:  All rise, court is back in
9      session.
10           THE COURT:  Everybody have a seat.
11           (Off the record from 2:52 p.m. to 2:52 p.m.)
12           THE COURT:  We ready to go.
13           MR. PERSONS:  Yes, Your Honor.
14           THE COURT:  If the jury's ready.  Let's see if
15      they're ready.  If they are, Deputy Rudd, we'll
16      bring them back in.
17           THE BAILIFF:  All right.
18           THE COURT:  Mr. Persons, you have almost
19      another 40 minutes or so to go.
20           MR. PERSONS:  I thought I had more time than
21      that.
22           THE COURT:  You started at 1:08.
23           THE CLERK:  Yeah.
24           MR. PERSONS:  Okay.
25           MR. KREINER:  We broke at 2:40, that's an hour 3293
1      and a half.
2           THE COURT:  I won't charge the 15 minutes
3      against you, but you started at 1:08.
4           MR. PERSONS:  Okay.  Thanks for that, letting
5      me know.
6           THE COURT:  Now, that's how much time you
7      have.  Now, you are not required to use it.
8           MR. PERSONS:  I probably won't use that much.
9      I would be surprised if I do.
10           THE COURT:  All right.  Because we are going
11      to go to the jury today.
12           MR. PERSONS:  Okay.
13           THE COURT:  Also, I'm going to -- once they do
14      go in there, I'm going to have the bailiff let them
15      know about ordering supper and we can get that
16      process started, too.
17           MR. PERSONS:  Okay.
18           THE COURT:  So.
19           MR. PERSONS:  Okay.
20           THE COURT:  By the time they want something to
21      eat, they should have something here.
22           MR. PERSONS:  Excellent.  Then that will give
23      us time to look at the --
24           THE COURT:  Right.  We'll do that.
25           THE CLERK:  Do you have like a set time that 3294
1      you're going to let them go to or is it going to be
2      up to them?
3           THE COURT:  It's going to be up to them.
4      We're going to go tonight until they either get
5      finished or they tell me they're too tired to go
6      on.
7           THE BAILIFF:  All rise for the jury.
8           (The jury entered the courtroom.)
9           THE COURT:  All right, everybody have a seat.
10      I'll note the jury has returned, the lawyers are
11      here, Ms. Ellis is here.  You may continue, sir.
12           MR. PERSONS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
13           THE COURT:  Okay.
14           MR. PERSONS:  All right.  When we broke, we
15      were talking about Mr. Ellis's knowledge of the
16      dangers of smoking.  And in Mrs. Ellis's words, she
17      said that he knew that smoking could lead to his
18      demise.  Mr. Ellis's daughters continually told
19      Mr. Ellis that smoking was bad for his health and
20      encouraged him to quit smoking.
21           His sisters got on him about smoking and
22      encouraged him to quit.  Sally Harrison told
23      Mr. Ellis that smoking causes cancer and that he
24      should not smoke.  Mr. Ellis told Martha Jean
25      Martin that smoking was a nasty habit meaning it 3295
1      was addictive and dangerous.  Barbara Dixon told
2      Mr. Ellis that smoking might be harmful to him.
3           So lots of personal warnings from people close
4      to him, people who care about him, about the
5      dangers of smoking and the need to quit smoking.
6           Mrs. Ellis believed -- Mr. Ellis believed the
7      risks of smoking.  Mrs. Ellis testified that
8      Mr. Ellis knew that smoking could lead to his
9      demise.  Martha Jean Martin testified Mr. Ellis
10      knew that smoking was hazardous to his health.
11      Dr. McCoy testified that Mr. Ellis was already
12      aware of the risks of smoking before he sought
13      treatment with Dr. McCoy.
14           Now, let's talk about concealment.  Because
15      that's a question on the verdict form that you are
16      going to have to deal with.  And it involves a
17      material fact.  The omission or concealment of a
18      material fact.
19           And what is a material fact?  A material fact
20      is one that is of such importance that Mr. Ellis
21      would not have acted as he did but for the
22      concealment or omission of that fact.  In other
23      words, it could have -- it would have affected the
24      outcome, that he would have acted in a different
25      way had he been aware of a material fact. 3296
1           A material fact is one that would have changed
2      his behavior.  That would be a material fact.
3           And so what does this mean in terms of the
4      concealment case that you have to decide?  And
5      remember, I told you earlier about the requirement
6      that it's a but for, that for something to be a
7      legal cause, a substantial cause, a
8      substantially-contributing cause, it has to be a
9      but-for cause, that but for this particular thing,
10      then Mr. Ellis would not have died.
11           There is no evidence of any concealment, that
12      the concealment led Mr. Ellis to start smoking.
13           There is no evidence that anything, that any
14      concealment caused him to continue to smoke.  There
15      is no evidence that Mr. Ellis was in the dark about
16      information related to the dangers and
17      addictiveness of smoking.
18           As he told his daughter Tammy, "I've heard it
19      all before," when she would, in her words, nag him
20      about smoking and say "I've heard it all before."
21      That's the evidence in the case.
22           What the plaintiff was trying to convince you
23      is that somehow the tobacco company messages
24      confused Mr. Ellis and tricked him into smoking.
25      That somehow the internal information the tobacco 3297
1      companies had would have led Mr. Ellis to quit
2      smoking if only he had known about it.
3           And here is the most important admission on
4      the issue of concealment.  Mrs. Ellis told us, she
5      told you that she didn't think there was anything
6      that anyone could have told Mr. Ellis, said to him
7      to make him quit smoking before he became ill.
8      Nothing anyone could have told him that would have
9      caused him to quit smoking before he became ill.
10           Think about that for a moment.  Nothing the
11      Tobacco Industry Research Committee, nothing R.J.
12      Reynolds ever said, nothing that Brown & Williamson
13      or Liggett or Lorillard said, nothing Philip Morris
14      could have said, nothing the Council For Tobacco
15      Research could have said, nothing anyone could have
16      said to make Mr. Ellis quit smoking before he
17      became ill.
18           That was her testimony from that witness stand
19      in this trial after days of evidence had come in
20      about secret documents and things that were
21      allegedly concealed and withheld in the way of
22      scientific information in discovery about the link
23      between smoking and cancer, testimony about
24      ammoniated tobacco, testimony about levulinic acid,
25      testimony about nicotinic receptors and 3298
1      upregulation in the brain, nothing anyone could
2      have said to make Mr. Ellis quit smoking before he
3      became ill.
4           That's the testimony, and it's the testimony
5      from someone who knew him better than anyone who's
6      testified in this case.  And I venture to say knew
7      him better than anybody in the world.  Nothing
8      anyone could have said could have caused him to
9      quit smoking.
10           There is absolutely no way the plaintiff can
11      meet the burden of proving that concealment of
12      information or an agreement to conceal information
13      somehow would have convinced Mr. Ellis to quit
14      smoking in time to avoid illness.
15           Did I do something wrong?
16           MR. SMITH:  No.
17           MR. PERSONS:  Oh.  Thought I had messed up.
18           Now, if your question -- your answer to
19      question number 1 is no, and I submit to you it
20      should be, then that would be the end of the
21      process and you should proceed no further except to
22      sign and date the verdict form and return it to the
23      courtroom.
24           If you answer yes, only then would you proceed
25      to the next question that appears on the form, 3299
1      question number 2.  "Was R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
2      Company's concealment or omission of material
3      information about the health effects or addictive
4      nature of smoking cigarettes, or both, a legal
5      cause of Clarence C. Ellis's death?"  And the
6      answer should be no.
7           Number 3, "Was R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's
8      agreement with other cigarette manufacturers and
9      corporations to conceal or omit information
10      regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their
11      addictive nature a legal cause of Clarence Ellis's
12      death?"  Answer, no.
13           Thank you, sir.
14           Now, the next question on the verdict form
15      will be question number 4.  "Please state the
16      percentage of any fault that was a legal cause of
17      Clarence C. Ellis's death that you charge to R.J.
18      Reynolds Tobacco Company, Clarence C. Ellis," and
19      it has to add up to a hundred percent.
20           Let's talk about allocation of fault.  And it
21      is only if you find for the plaintiff on this class
22      membership question against Reynolds do you even
23      get down to answering these other questions,
24      including this one.  I mentioned to you earlier and
25      I showed you on where Mrs. Ellis submitted that 3300
1      Mr. Ellis would bear fault for his illness and
2      death.
3           The evidence will show or has shown that it is
4      Mr. Ellis who was at fault in his death and not
5      R.J. Reynolds.  R.J. Reynolds, assignment of fault
6      relates only to actions that were a legal cause of
7      his death.  R.J. Reynolds cannot be assigned fault
8      for actions that were not a legal cause of his
9      death.
10           So that the secret documents, the stupid
11      comments, denials by the tobacco executives, if
12      they weren't a legal cause of his death, then fault
13      can't be assigned R.J. Reynolds for those things.
14      However inappropriate, no matter how offensive, no
15      matter how stupid those things were, there has to
16      be a causal nexus between those things and the
17      death of Mr. Ellis.
18           And you know the evidence.  You know that
19      Mr. Ellis made the choice to start smoking because
20      Mrs. Ellis told us so.  You know that he made the
21      choice to continue smoking because Mrs. Ellis told
22      us so.  You know that Mr. Ellis made the decision
23      not to try to quit smoking because the evidence
24      tells us so.
25           You know that the choice to stop smoking is 3301
1      100 percent in the control of the smoker because
2      Dr. Burns, their expert, told us so.
3           Mr. Ellis's choices were the only cause of his
4      death.  Let's look at them.
5           Plaintiff admits that Mr. Ellis's actions were
6      a cause of his death.  Mr. Ellis chose to smoke
7      after his parents told the children not to smoke.
8      Mr. Ellis considered smoking to be his business.
9      And please don't overlook that.  That's very
10      significant.  That's very, very significant.  And
11      I'm going to urge you to do the right thing, too,
12      but I know that you will.
13           It's very telling.  "It's my business.  You
14      tend to your business and I'll tend to mine."  In
15      other words, you leave me alone.
16           Mr. Ellis responded to warnings with
17      indifference, whether it was a shrug of the
18      shoulders when Sally Opal Harrison, his sister, his
19      big sister, one of the people who raised him after
20      he lost his mother, told him that if he kept
21      smoking, he could get cancer.  They're living in
22      Moultrie at the time.  He shrugged his shoulders.
23           Mr. Ellis chose to smoke despite the package
24      warnings.  We know that Mr. Ellis was aware of the
25      warnings, we've got direct evidence of it. 3302
1      Mr. Ellis chose to continue smoking when millions
2      and millions of other smokers were quitting.  He
3      chose to ignore the constant warnings from the
4      media and the public health community.
5           There is nothing anyone could have said that
6      would have made Mr. Ellis quit.
7           Tammy and Kimberly, his daughters,
8      continuously begged Mr. Ellis to quit, and then he
9      chose to keep smoking.
10           Mr. Ellis was at fault for choosing to start
11      and continuing to smoke.
12           The decision to try to quit was a hundred
13      percent in his control.  Plaintiff admits that he
14      had the ability to quit sooner.  That's part of
15      their partial admission of fault, that he had the
16      ability to quit sooner.
17           Mr. Ellis chose to continue smoking after
18      Mrs. Ellis quit smoking.  Mr. Ellis refused to seek
19      help to quit.  Mr. Ellis said "I'm not ready to
20      quit."  Plaintiff admits that he could have
21      prevented his own death and he could have done it
22      by quitting sooner.
23           Dr. Burns testified that had Mr. Ellis quit
24      smoking as late as 1978, his chances of dying of
25      lung cancer would have been those of someone who 3303
1      had never smoked.  He could have essentially
2      avoided the disease.  Now, that's assuming that he
3      did have a primary lung cancer.  That's assuming he
4      had a primary lung cancer.  So even if you assume
5      he had a primary lung cancer, he could have avoided
6      that eventuality, he could have avoided his demise
7      had he quit smoking as late as 1978.
8           Mrs. Ellis quit in 1977 using information from
9      the American Heart Association, a pamphlet.  No
10      Chantix, it didn't exist at the time.  No gum.  No
11      patch.  But delaying each day that first cigarette
12      to the point that she quit, and she stayed quit for
13      a whole year.
14           So that's how the fault stacks up.
15           And here is Dr. Burns' testimony.  "The bottom
16      line, sir, would you agree that if Mr. Ellis would
17      have quit smoking as late as 1978, 15 years before
18      his death, in your opinion, it is more medically
19      likely than not he would have avoided his lung
20      cancer; is that true?"
21           Answer:  "That's correct.  Looking backwards
22      from his having the lung cancer, yes."
23           We know some things about Mr. Ellis's
24      relationship with his smoking, Mrs. Ellis shared
25      with us.  "After he became sick, Mr. Ellis never 3304
1      said that he was sorry that he smoked, did he?
2           "No.
3           "He never said that if he'd known what was
4      going to happen, he would not have smoked?
5           "No.
6           "And he never expressed any regret for having
7      smoked?
8           "No, he didn't verbalize it."
9           That's consistent with the things we've heard
10      about the kind of person Mr. Ellis was, because
11      smoking was his business.
12           His choices are the only legal cause of his
13      death.  There is nothing R.J. Reynolds could have
14      done that would have prevented Mr. Ellis from
15      dying.  Only Mr. Ellis had the ability to prevent
16      his death, and he is 100 percent responsible for
17      the choices that he made.
18           And when you get to question number 4, "Please
19      state the percentage of any fault that was a legal
20      cause of Clarence C. Ellis's death," that you
21      charge a hundred percent to Clarence Ellis.
22           The next question has to do with damages.  And
23      I suggest you won't get there, but if you do, I
24      have to talk about it, because if I don't, that
25      will be one of the first things somebody says is, 3305
1      well, he didn't even talk about damages.
2           Just because I talk about damages doesn't mean
3      that they ought to be awarded.  But if you do award
4      damages, they have to be just and reasonable in
5      light of the evidence.  That's what the judge will
6      charge you.
7           Let's see what the plaintiff -- any damages
8      must be fair and just in light of the evidence.
9           Plaintiff's claim for $10 million defies
10      common sense.  They're not asking for damages
11      related to medical expenses or funeral expenses,
12      economic damages for Mrs. Ellis, lost services for
13      Mrs. Ellis, COPD, or Mrs. Ellis's pain and
14      suffering.  They're asking damages for loss of
15      support and pain and suffering to Mrs. Ellis.
16      Mrs. Ellis.  Not Mr. Ellis's pain and suffering.
17           I submit to you plaintiff is attempting to
18      inflate her damage award by asking you for a huge
19      amount of money that has no basis in the evidence.
20      So to be fair and do the right thing and to do the
21      right thing to them means $10 million.
22           No one should be awarded millions of dollars
23      because their spouse chose to smoke cigarettes for
24      decades knowing they were dangerous.  Just ask that
25      you use common sense. 3306
1           I apologize, there was something I thought I
2      had and yet I didn't have it.
3           When we examined Dr. Cummings, he talked about
4      a pamphlet that he had prepared for the American
5      Cancer Society that he used in instructing people
6      on how to quit smoking, and telling them that they
7      could quit smoking.  He said that, "Any smoker can
8      quit if they're willing to put up with some uneasy
9      moments after stopping."
10           Is it worth putting up with some uneasy
11      moments to save your life?  And should someone
12      receive millions of dollars because someone, a
13      loved one was unwilling to put up with some uneasy
14      moments?  Uneasy moments that could have saved
15      their life and avoided their demise.
16           Question number 5, "What is the amount, total
17      amount, 100 percent, of any damages sustained by
18      plaintiff Betty Jean Ellis for the loss of Clarence
19      C. Ellis's companionship and protection and for her
20      pain and suffering as a result of Clarence Ellis's
21      injury and death?"
22           I'm not going to put a number in there.  If
23      you get to that part of the verdict form, you will
24      use your own judgment about what's fair and just in
25      light of the evidence.  And in light of the 3307
1      testimony of Dr. Cummings about someone's
2      willingness to put up with a few uneasy moment
3      after they stopped smoking.
4           MR. SALES:  Excuse me, Your Honor, objection,
5      there is no damage to be awarded for the decedent.
6           THE COURT:  True, but I'm not sure I heard
7      that, but overruled.  Overruled.  Hold on, let me
8      look at the --
9           Overruled.
10           MR. PERSONS:  All right.  Let's talk about
11      punitive damages.  The sixth question on the
12      verdict form, "Under the circumstances of this
13      case, state whether you find by clear and
14      convincing evidence that punitive damages are
15      warranted against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company."
16           Punitive damages can only be awarded -- can be
17      awarded only for any concealment or agreement to
18      conceal that was a legal cause of Mr. Ellis's
19      death.  Punitive damages can be awarded only to
20      Mrs. Ellis.  And punitive damages are in addition
21      to damages that fully compensate Mrs. Ellis.
22           Let's talk about clear and convincing
23      evidence.  "Clear and convincing evidence differs
24      from the greater weight of the evidence in that it
25      is more compelling and persuasive." 3308
1           The judge will instruct you.  "Greater weight
2      of the evidence means the more persuasive and
3      convincing force and effect of the entire evidence
4      in the case.  In contrast, clear and convincing
5      evidence is evidence that is precise, explicit,
6      lacking in confusion, and of such weight that it
7      produces a firm belief or conviction without
8      hesitation about the matter in issue."
9           "Evidence that is precise, explicit, lacking
10      in confusion, and of such weight that it produces a
11      firm belief or conviction without hesitation about
12      the matter in issue."
13           So if there is any hesitation whatsoever about
14      whether punitive damages should be awarded, I
15      submit to you there is not clear and convincing
16      evidence.  Clear and convincing evidence, that's a
17      heavier burden than the greater weight of the
18      evidence.
19           Well, I submit to you R.J. Reynolds should not
20      be punished.
21           The Council For Tobacco Research funded more
22      than $500 million worth of research.  They funded
23      6,000 published articles, many of them in
24      prestigious journals.  We talked about that with
25      Dr. Cummings.  The New England Journal of Medicine 3309
1      was one of them.  The Journal of the American
2      Medical Association was another.
3           More than 600 of these articles were cited in
4      the Surgeon General's Reports.  They funded Nobel
5      prize winners, scientists of that caliber.  They
6      funded research in universities across the country.
7           Dr. Cummings shared this with you.  "And when
8      those scientists received grants from the Council
9      For Tobacco Research and they conducted their
10      research, they were given complete independence as
11      to whether or not they published articles, weren't
12      they?
13           "Yes."
14           They had complete independence from the source
15      of the funding, the tobacco companies.
16           Here is one such article.  Some of that money
17      went to fund articles like this one.  When it said
18      nicotine -- this is 1963, American Journal of
19      Psychiatry.  "Nicotine is an active agent; it
20      appears to have certain addictive qualities.  Heavy
21      cigarette smokers thus appear to be true addicts."
22           "Our subjects also showed a compulsion to
23      continue to smoke in increasing amounts."  And then
24      they gave credit to the CTR.  "Supported in part by
25      grants from the Council For Tobacco Research." 3310
1      That's in 1963, that's 25 years before the 1988
2      Surgeon General's Report that was dedicated to or
3      focused on the addictive nature of nicotine.
4           Reynolds developed a less mutagenic cigarette.
5      Mutagenic meaning cancer causing.
6           Question, I put this to Dr. Cummings, "You
7      told the jury that it would be a good thing to
8      develop cigarettes that were less mutagenic?"
9           Answer:  "Yes."
10           "You said such a product could cause less
11      cancer; correct?
12           "Yes."
13           Reynolds developed such a cigarette.  It
14      developed Premier and Eclipse.  They used a
15      heating, not burn, technology.  Because when you
16      burn tobacco or any organic material, you generate
17      these compounds, many of which are cancer causing.
18           They spent over a billion dollars developing
19      this product.  And Premier was released in the late
20      1980s.  Eclipse was a second generation of that
21      product, but failed commercially because people
22      refused to buy it.
23           They didn't like the way it tasted.  They
24      didn't like the way it smelled.  They refused to
25      buy it.  You can't force people to buy something. 3311
1      You put it on the market, you can't make them buy
2      it.  It's still a free country.
3           You heard during Dr. Burns' testimony, and he
4      showed you the Reynolds website.  Reynolds tells
5      consumers, it says, "Rely on the Surgeon General,
6      the Centers For Disease Control, and other public,
7      health, and medical officials when making decisions
8      regarding smoking."  That's what they're told to
9      do.
10           Punitive damages aren't warranted in this
11      case.  Cigarettes have carried warning labels since
12      1966 about being hazardous to your health.
13      Reynolds has reported the ingredients in cigarettes
14      since 1985 and has displayed the ingredients on its
15      website for years.
16           Reynolds has not disputed the dangers or
17      addictiveness of tobacco for more than a decade.
18      And punitive damages are not necessary to prevent
19      Reynolds from concealing the dangers of tobacco.
20      That's well known.
21           And this business about, well, we looked to
22      Reynolds for information about the health effects
23      of tobacco.  I don't think anybody enjoys a nice,
24      cold beer more than I do.
25           MR. SALES:  Objection, Your Honor.  Counsel's 3312
1      enjoyment is irrelevant, it's argumentative.
2           THE COURT:  Okay.
3           MR. PERSONS:  It's argument.
4           THE COURT:  He can talk about cold beer but
5      not that he enjoys it.
6           MR. PERSONS:  Okay, I won't say that I enjoy
7      it.
8           MR. SALES:  Although I believe you.
9           MR. PERSONS:  But you don't look -- you don't
10      look to Anheuser-Busch to give you advice about the
11      dangers of alcohol consumption, no more than you
12      would look to Johnny Walker or Jack Daniels for
13      such advice.
14           I don't know whether they still run the
15      commercial, but the beef association used to run a
16      commercial called "What's For Dinner?"  But I
17      didn't see anything in those commercials about red
18      meat and how bad it is for you and all of that.  I
19      mean, you run a business and advertising a product,
20      you're trying to encourage people to buy it, that's
21      the whole idea, not to discourage them from buying
22      it.
23           And common sense tells us and life experience
24      tells us that we don't go to the egg counsel, egg
25      producers for health information about the 3313
1      cholesterol content of eggs or go to the beef
2      counsel for information about the cholesterol
3      content of beef.
4           And we do things that we're told may be bad
5      for us.  It's like Harry Reasoner said, "In a
6      country such as this, nobody is going to prevent an
7      adult to smoke," because people choose to do
8      certain activities, there is nothing wrong with
9      that, but oftentimes there are consequences
10      associated with those activities that can be
11      adverse to one's health.
12           Sometimes it's a hard choice between having
13      that key lime pie for desert or not having that
14      hamburger or driving by Popeyes and not stopping
15      for some Popeyes chicken, knowing that it's not the
16      healthiest choice.  But no one is to be faulted for
17      it in a free country.
18           And so I want to leave you with this.  So
19      1955.  And this is Dr. Cuyler Hammond, one of the
20      leading research -- medical researchers in the
21      country.  He's talking about the dangers of
22      smoking.
23           (Video clip played as follows:)
24           DR. HAMMOND:  It is now established, in my
25      opinion, beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette 3314
1      smoking greatly increases the probability of
2      developing lung cancer.  In my opinion, people
3      should be warned of the dangers, and they are being
4      warned.  What they then want to do, whether they
5      wish to smoke or not, is their own business.
6           (Video clip stopped.)
7           MR. PERSONS:  So I submit to you a verdict for
8      the plaintiff in this case will say that it's okay
9      to knowingly engage in a risky behavior and then to
10      blame others for your demise.  I submit to you that
11      the only just verdict in this case would be one in
12      favor of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
13           I thank you for your kind attention.
