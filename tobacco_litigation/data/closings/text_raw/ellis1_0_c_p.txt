13           MR. GUSTAFSON:  Good morning.
14           JURORS:  Good morning.
15           MR. GUSTAFSON:  Been a long two weeks.
16           JUROR ERATO:  Yes.
17           MR. GUSTAFSON:  Y'all have learned a lot.
18           JUROR HOLDEN:  Oh, yeah.
19           MR. GUSTAFSON:  Clarence Sonny Ellis.  The
20      evidence says he started smoking between 1948, when
21      he was 12 years old, and 1953, 1954, when he was
22      16, 17 years old, a senior in high school.  He was
23      smoking daily by the age of 18.
24           By the age of 19, when he was married to Betty
25      Ellis, he was showing clear signs of addiction, 3151
1      smoking when his feet hit the floor on the way to
2      the bathroom first thing in the morning.
3           The tobacco company documents tell you they
4      intended to sell their addictive product to kids.
5      They knew that if you got a teenager addicted to
6      nicotine, they were going to get a lifetime of
7      profits.
8           That's exactly what they intended.  That's
9      exactly what they accomplished to an entire
10      generation of Americans.  He was a teenager like
11      all those others, and they enjoyed decades of
12      profits off his lungs.
13           And as we all know from growing up, peer
14      pressure is real.  Peer pressure gets to young
15      people.  The defendant knew that and the other
16      companies knew that, and they exploited it in their
17      search for replacement smokers.
18           You add a little marketing, you add a little
19      nicotine, just the right amount, and lo and behold,
20      70 percent of the people in Sonny Ellis's age group
21      were smokers.
22           Now, it would have been unusual if Sonny Ellis
23      wasn't a smoker.  He would have been in the
24      minority.  That's how accepted and normal this was.
25      The decision to start smoking in 1948 or 1949 or 3152
1      1954 or whatever it was for Sonny Ellis, that
2      decision is nothing like a decision to start
3      smoking today.
4           What we know today, what you know now is more
5      than you knew when you walked in here two weeks
6      ago.  They want to tell you that Sonny Ellis knew
7      all of that back in the '70s and '80s and '90s.
8           It would have been really unusual if Sonny
9      Ellis were just able to put cigarettes down and
10      walk away like the defendant says he should.  And
11      you know why that would have been really unusual.
12           They engineered cigarettes to be addictive,
13      through technology, through additives, through
14      monkeying with what they put in their product, they
15      engineered cigarettes to be hard to give up.  They
16      knew exactly what they were doing long before the
17      public health authorities who testified here knew.
18      Long before the experts knew.  Long before the
19      tobacco control people who studied this and lived
20      this in their professional lives.
21           Long before they knew, the tobacco companies
22      knew because they were doing it on purpose.  But
23      they say Sonny Ellis should have known all along.
24           They spent the next few decades perfecting
25      ways to make cigarettes as addictive as they could. 3153
1      They take the nicotine out when they process the
2      tobacco.  They put just the right amount of
3      nicotine back in so they can maintain addiction,
4      because the documents you have in evidence show you
5      that if they didn't put enough nicotine back in to
6      maintain addiction in their customers, their
7      customers would stop smoking, because nicotine is
8      why people smoke.  They ain't smoking for the
9      Turkish blend, they're smoking for the nicotine.
10           They changed the pH level of the smoke to make
11      the smoke more inhalable because the more inhalable
12      it was, the more addictive it became.  They added
13      ammonia compounds so that their customers would
14      freebase nicotine to the brain.
15           They added levulinic acid to increase nicotine
16      binding in their customers' brains.  They tried
17      their best to make quitting as hard as they could.
18      And they were successful because only 3 percent of
19      people who try to quit are successful long term.
20      They have to try over and over and over again for
21      years, and many of them are never successful.
22           Despite that evidence, despite the unrebutted
23      evidence on these points, they say it was Sonny
24      Ellis's free, unfettered choice to continue
25      smoking.  And there is strong evidence in this case 3154
1      of Sonny Ellis's addiction.  Excuse me.
2           There is no question, this is unrebutted,
3      uncontested evidence, that the defendant and the
4      other companies designed cigarettes to be
5      addictive.  They intended people like Sonny Ellis
6      to get addicted when they used the product.  That
7      was the point.
8           It was unrebutted, uncontested evidence that
9      they concealed what they did to make cigarettes
10      addictive.  And that they lied for decades to keep
11      it going.  And they want you to give them a pass.
12           There is no question that what they did
13      worked.  Their own documents that we have in
14      evidence here and showed you in this trial showed
15      they knew it worked.  They knew it was working,
16      they congratulated themselves on how well it was
17      working.  And it not only worked, it made them a
18      lot of money.  They congratulate themselves on
19      that.
20           The only question now is what are y'all going
21      to do about it?
22           You're going to have to decide whether you're
23      going to tolerate lies and liars because that's
24      just business.  You're going to have to decide
25      whether it's right or wrong to design something to 3155
1      be addictive and then lie about it; market it as
2      safe when you know it will kill people; and exploit
3      addicted people to keep doing what they're addicted
4      to by lying to them and telling them that it ain't
5      proven that what you are addicted to is even
6      harmful.  All the while knowing that their business
7      plan is going to result in millions of people
8      dying, and they didn't care.
9           Did you see any evidence from R.J. Reynolds in
10      this trial that they cared?  Things don't square up
11      till your verdict speaks that you're not going to
12      let the defendant profit from lies and deceit.
13           Every R.J. Reynolds executive who testified in
14      this trial, either on videotape or on the documents
15      they wrote, their statements show that what they
16      did was intentional.  Their statements show it was
17      all something they knew was false.  And it was
18      something they knew was working.  And it was all
19      done for money.
20           They knew what they were doing was wrong.
21      They knew that when they were doing it.  And we
22      found out what they did, and now y'all know what
23      they did.  You've just got to decide what you're
24      going to do about it.
25           So why do people smoke?  Well, you learned in 3156
1      this trial that the reason people smoke cigarettes
2      is for nicotine.  Even though they've known for
3      decades how to take the nicotine out, the defendant
4      keeps putting it back in there at just the right
5      amount to maintain addiction.
6           Even though they've been able to grow tobacco
7      with no nicotine in it, they keep growing the kind
8      that has the nicotine in it.  They not only choose
9      to keep the nicotine in their product, but they
10      engineer the cigarettes to maintain addiction and
11      make it as hard as they can for people to quit.
12           They were doing all they could to take choice
13      away, and then they tell you that smokers like
14      Sonny Ellis simply choose to keep smoking.  They
15      want to have it both ways.
16           They add things to cigarettes to engineer
17      addiction, and then they tell you that Sonny Ellis
18      should have just quit.
19           And you know now why it is that people smoke
20      until they die from lung cancer.  You know now why
21      it is they make adapters for tracheostomies for
22      people to put a cigarette in and smoke it through
23      their throat.  They're not doing that because
24      cigarettes are so much fun to smoke.  They're doing
25      that because they're addicted.  And they lied about 3157
1      cigarettes being addictive and they lied about
2      cigarettes causing cancer.
3           Now, all those lies were just designed to
4      speak to people like Sonny Ellis who were addicted
5      smokers, to give them a psychological crutch to
6      keep doing what it is they're addicted to.  That
7      was the whole point of their conspiracy.  That was
8      the whole point of all of them banding together to
9      lie about cigarettes not being proven to cause
10      cancer or COPD or anything else, to create that
11      controversy.
12           And they lied about addiction, because it gave
13      them an excuse to blame smokers for their behavior,
14      all the while they're back there with chemists and
15      everybody else engineering these things to make
16      them as addictive and hard to quit as they can.
17      They don't get it both ways.
18           You've got to take yourself back in time,
19      though.  They promised, they promised, in the
20      videos we showed you, if there is anything bad in
21      it, we're going to take it out.  If there is
22      anything bad in it.  And then promised your health
23      is of paramount concern to us.
24           Trust us, we're going to work with the public
25      health authorities, we're going to set up these 3158
1      tobacco research institutes and we're going to hire
2      all these esteemed scientists, we're going to be
3      first to let you know if what we find out.
4           We're going to hire the most esteemed
5      scientists, people like Clarence Cook Little, who
6      lied.  We're going to set up this research
7      committee and fund it and it lied.  We're going to
8      spend all this money to research all of this and
9      tell you what our findings are, and they withheld
10      the findings.
11           They withheld the findings from us, and they
12      withheld the findings from the public health
13      authorities.  They promised to look out for
14      everybody and cooperate with the public health
15      authorities, and they did everything but.
16           Hugh Cullman said "We want to be the
17      detectives just as much as the Surgeon General and
18      the AMA, and we'll cooperate in every way."  Ask
19      yourself, what evidence did they bring you?  That
20      they were detectives just as much as the Surgeon
21      General and the AMA and that they cooperated in
22      every way.  What evidence did R.J. Reynolds bring
23      you in this trial that that's what they did?
24           They knew this message was a powerful one.
25      They said things like, you saw the document from 3159
1      the '60s, "if it causes lung cancer, we'll stop
2      making cigarettes tomorrow."
3           They knew that message is a powerful one for
4      addicted smokers.  They designed it that way.  They
5      knew that if you're addicted and you try to quit
6      and you fail, that it can be so overpowering and
7      crushing the idea of failing so many times, you
8      latch onto a message that gives you a psychological
9      crutch to keep doing what you're doing.
10           Their customers, though, the difference in
11      this kind of addiction and this kind of product is
12      that the customers can be addicted to nicotine in
13      cigarettes, but they can still be productive
14      members of society.  Can be a good parent, good
15      father, good mother, could be a good employee.
16      Could be all the things that Sonny Ellis was, a
17      good breadwinner, devoted family member and friend,
18      do all the things that life requires and you can be
19      an addict, a nicotine addict.  And Sonny Ellis was
20      that kind of person.
21           You heard all the words to describe him.  He
22      was intelligent, he was honest, he was loyal, he
23      was determined, he was a hard worker, he was kind,
24      he was a quiet man, he meant what he said and said
25      what he meant and didn't say any more.  He couldn't 3160
1      have been a lawyer.  He couldn't have talked for
2      two hours.
3           But he was trustworthy and he's someone --
4      he's someone that you would want as a friend.
5      That's the kind of person that was described to
6      you.  And he was addicted.
7           You heard all the things about how determined
8      he was and how he was somebody who could do all
9      these things.  Well, the one thing that he couldn't
10      beat, he could beat alcohol, got in that wreck, got
11      hit by that steamroller, cement truck, whatever it
12      was, in 1984, developed a drinking problem, goes to
13      a rehab center, he's able to quit drinking, but he
14      can't quit smoking.  What does that tell you about
15      the type of addiction that he had to nicotine?  He
16      never touched alcohol again, but he smoked until he
17      died.
18           Addiction to nicotine is why he smoked two
19      cartons of cigarettes a week for 34 years.  It's
20      what caused the smoking.  It caused the lung cancer
21      that metastasized and killed him.  And what did
22      R.J. Reynolds bring you to dispute that?
23           They brought you Dr. Jaffe.  Did Dr. Jaffe
24      explain to you that Mr. Ellis didn't freebase
25      nicotine to his brain?  Did Dr. Jaffe explain to 3161
1      you that all that ammonium hydroxide and diammonium
2      phosphate and rat poison they were putting in Lucky
3      Strikes cigarettes, the interrogatory with the
4      recipe is in evidence, did he tell you that that
5      stuff somehow didn't affect Sonny Ellis?
6           Did he explain to you how it is even possible
7      to be exposed to a powerfully addictive drug,
8      hundreds of doses a day for decades, every day, did
9      he explain to you how it was possible you could do
10      that and not become addicted?
11           Did he explain that Sonny Ellis was impervious
12      to this powerfully addictive drug?  Because, you
13      know, nicotine addiction, and by the Surgeon
14      General and folks that write on this, they compare
15      the pathways of addiction to heroin and cocaine,
16      which are illicit drugs, illegal to buy, unlike
17      cigarettes, you get them at the Winn Dixie,
18      convenience store, wherever you go, you can get
19      cigarettes.
20           If Sonny Ellis had been dosing himself with
21      cocaine hundreds of times a day for 30 years, would
22      we even be having this conversation?  Would there
23      be any question that he was addicted?
24           And the reason why we look at it differently,
25      I submit, is because we all grew up with 3162
1      cigarettes.  We've got pockets on our shirts to put
2      cigarettes in.  We used to put ashtrays out in our
3      homes.  If we didn't even smoke, we put ashtrays
4      out for people to come over and smoke in our house.
5      Even if we didn't smoke, we owned the ashtrays.
6           We used to -- we made cigarette ashtrays for
7      our fathers when we were in seventh grade shop
8      class.  We brought them home to our dads who were
9      trying to quit.
10           It was such an accepted part of American life,
11      unlike these other types of drugs, that the idea
12      that it was addictive was just foreign to everyone
13      except the defendant and the other companies.
14           Sonny Ellis grew up when everybody smoked.
15      Heroes smoked, athletes smoked, actors smoked.  At
16      his school, when he's in high school, the joint
17      board of education took a picture in his high
18      school yearbook, it's in evidence.  What's on the
19      table in front of these gentlemen, the role models
20      in Sonny Ellis's life as a teen, were smoking
21      cigarettes.
22           All the role models smoked.  It was how boys
23      wanted to look like men and it was how girls wanted
24      to look like women and be glamorous.  It seems
25      silly now knowing what we know today in 2014, 3163
1      knowing what we know about cigarettes now, it's a
2      completely different mindset than what it was like
3      back then.
4           Imagine, imagine if Leon High School's
5      yearbook or Godby or whoever had their deans and
6      principals in the yearbook with ashtrays on the
7      table in front of them.  There would be a public
8      outcry.  It's a very different time.
9           So as the plaintiff in this case, we've got to
10      prove certain things.  Y'all have heard me talk
11      about this in jury selection, and the judge just
12      read you the instructions.  We've got to prove
13      Sonny Ellis was a member of the Engle class.
14           And we've got to prove that by the greater
15      weight of the evidence.  Not by beyond and to the
16      exclusion of all reasonable doubt, like we're
17      sending someone to jail or something.  It's a
18      different standard.  It's a lower standard in a
19      civil case than in a criminal case.  So did we tip
20      the scales in our favor in this case?  Did we
21      provide the more convincing evidence of Sonny
22      Ellis's class membership?  I submit to you that we
23      did.
24           First question on the verdict form is "Do you
25      find that Clarence C. Ellis was addicted to 3164
1      cigarettes containing nicotine, and that Mr. Ellis
2      had lung cancer, and, if so, that his addiction was
3      a legal cause of his lung cancer and death?"  I
4      want to point out to you, it says "that his
5      addiction was a legal cause of his lung cancer and
6      death."
7           You get that question repeatedly on this
8      verdict form, and you're going to see that in the
9      instructions "a legal cause", not "the legal
10      cause."
11           And it's important.  And I talked about this
12      in opening statement.  His addiction doesn't have
13      to be the only cause of his death.  The addiction
14      can be one of the causes of his death as long as it
15      contributes substantially.
16           It can work in tandem with other causes.  R.J.
17      Reynolds' concealment.  R.J. Reynolds'
18      participation in the conspiracy all those years and
19      lying about what these companies knew to be true
20      about their product in order to keep addicted
21      smokers smoking.
22           It works in tandem with Sonny Ellis's failure
23      to try harder to quit.  Mrs. Ellis comes to this
24      trial telling you her husband bears responsibility
25      here, but not alone. 3165
1           And so we don't exclude all these other
2      causes.  They all work in tandem together because
3      the law recognizes that life is complex and that
4      events don't just happen usually from one single
5      event, usually it's a bunch of events that work
6      together.  The law recognizes the complexities of
7      that, and that's why you get this kind of
8      instruction about "an addiction to smoking
9      cigarettes containing nicotine is a legal cause,"
10      not the legal cause, "a legal cause of cancer and
11      death if it directly and in natural and continuous
12      sequence produces it."
13           But then it says, in the bottom paragraph, "In
14      order to be regarded as a legal cause of cancer and
15      death, an addiction to cigarettes containing
16      nicotine need not be the only cause."  These things
17      all work together.  You're going to get this
18      instruction on every claim in this case.
19           "An addiction to cigarettes containing
20      nicotine may be a legal cause of cancer and death
21      even though it operates in combination with the act
22      of another or some other cause if the addiction
23      contributes substantially to producing the cancer
24      and death."
25           So what was the evidence in this case on Sonny 3166
1      Ellis's addiction?  Dr. Burns, who writes the
2      chapters in the books in our doctors' offices on
3      nicotine addiction.  Dr. Burns said Mr. Ellis was
4      addicted.  Dr. Cummings, who is a cancer researcher
5      and teaches physicians how to do this, set up the
6      New York State Quitline, has worked with
7      something -- I think if he said 10,000 smokers in
8      his 30-year career doing this.  He says that
9      Mr. Ellis was addicted.
10           Dr. McCoy, his family doctor, Dr. Sheedy, his
11      oncologist, Dr. Martin and Dr. Bianco.  Betty Ellis
12      said, not a doctor, but I think he was addicted.
13      And Sonny Ellis told us that.
14           Sonny Ellis in the depositions you saw, and
15      I'll show you the transcripts in a minute, "I wish
16      to goodness I could quit.  I've been doing it so
17      long, I just can't."  Ms. Ellis said that her
18      husband would get tearful at times when he failed
19      to quit.  Sonny Ellis wanted to quit, Sonny Ellis
20      tried to quit.
21           Listening to Dr. Jaffe, wherever it is
22      Dr. Jaffe comes from, whether it's Michigan or
23      Connecticut or wherever it is, you know, he made it
24      sound like in order for someone to be addicted and
25      in order for someone to demonstrate they want to 3167
1      quit smoking they have to talk to everybody about
2      it.  Do you remember him saying that?
3           If he's not talking about it, that means he
4      doesn't want to quit.  And that's not fair.  We're
5      not all talkative, we're not all like Dr. Jaffe.
6      Some of us are quiet.  Some of us don't talk about
7      every problem we have.
8           And so you heard the evidence about Mr. Ellis
9      being a quiet man like his father.  And so he
10      didn't talk about quitting smoking with everybody.
11      But that doesn't mean he didn't want to quit.
12           We use the Fagerstrom test, Dr. Cummings
13      talked about it, and you're going to learn that the
14      evidence, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company uses the
15      Fagerstrom test to evaluate nicotine addiction in
16      their own internal company studies, when they bring
17      addicted smokers in and want to migrate them off
18      cigarettes onto another product called Snus, they
19      evaluate these people at R.J. Reynolds with the
20      Fagerstrom test, not this DSM thing that Dr. Jaffe
21      uses.  R.J. Reynolds uses the Fagerstrom.
22           What does the -- Sonny Ellis's medical records
23      say about his smoking history?  Two packs a day for
24      34 years.  Two packs of Lucky Strikes per day.
25      Smokes two packs per day tobacco habit for 34 3168
1      years.
2           Dr. Cummings, "no doubt in my mind that he was
3      addicted and heavily addicted.  Not a shred of
4      doubt in that regard."
5           Dr. Burns, "Was he addicted?
6           "Yes.
7           "The continuous exposure sustained the
8      addiction.  He was addicted to Lucky Strikes and
9      the Winstons."
10           Dr. Sheedy, "He was addicted to nicotine
11      contained in cigarette smoke."
12           Dr. McCoy, "There is no doubt in my mind he
13      was addicted to nicotine and smoking."
14           Betty Ellis, "He said, 'I'd just fail.'  He
15      said, 'I just attempted and I couldn't quit, and
16      I'm not going to do it again right now.'  And I'm
17      not a doctor so I couldn't say he was addicted, but
18      I believe with all my heart he was."
19           Barbara Dixon.  He told her he tried to quit.
20      "I wish to goodness I could quit."
21           Martha Martin, "I've got to give up this nasty
22      habit.  I've been doing it so long, I can't."
23           So what was his Fagerstrom assessment, how
24      soon do you wake up, remember, this was the one
25      thing that was most predictive about whether 3169
1      someone was going to be successful at quitting or
2      not.
3           The one thing that identified how addictive it
4      was, "How soon do you smoke?"  Within five minutes
5      he gets three points.  "He would get out of bed,
6      and cigarettes next to the bed, and he would pick
7      them up on his way to the bathroom and light up,
8      and he kept cigarettes in the bathroom."
9      Dr. Cummings scored him a three because he would
10      smoke within five minutes of waking.
11           Did he find it difficult to refrain from
12      smoking in places?  Well -- where it was forbidden.
13      What was the testimony on that?  He left a funeral
14      to smoke, he left his daughter's graduation to
15      smoke.  And Tammy said, as Dr. Jaffe was being
16      cross-examined, Tammy testified in any social
17      setting, if it was indoors, he would end up outside
18      smoking.  He left friends' homes to go outside and
19      smoke.
20           Now, you didn't hear any evidence in this case
21      that Sonny Ellis was one of those people who was an
22      inconsiderate man?  So he would leave, but he would
23      have to leave.
24           Which cigarette would he hate most to give up?
25      He's not here to tell us that and nobody knew, so 3170
1      we have to give him zero.  How many cigarettes did
2      he smoke a day?
3           He smoked two to four packs -- two packs a
4      day, which is 40 cigarettes a day.  Dr. Jaffe
5      admitted it was two to three packs.  Dr. Cummings's
6      testimony was two to three packs, and Betty Ellis
7      said it was two to three cartons a week.  So he
8      gets three points on number 4.
9           Do you smoke more frequently during the first
10      hours after awakening than during the rest of the
11      day?  Well, the testimony was he chain smoked in
12      the morning when he got up.  He didn't chain smoke
13      all day.  That's a trick.  You'd have to smoke nine
14      packs a day or something if you chain smoked all
15      day long.
16           What you heard was people go to sleep, the
17      nicotine levels in their receptors get low, and
18      when they wake, they got to replenish it, and they
19      replenished it first thing and then they chain --
20      (snaps fingers), (snaps fingers), (snaps fingers),
21      and he chain smoked in the morning to replenish
22      his.  And he chain smoked at night before he went
23      to bed.  And you'll hear, he got up in the middle
24      of the night to smoke cigarettes.
25           Next one, Jeff. 3171
1           Did he smoke when he was sick?  Well, we know
2      he smoked when he was diagnosed with lung cancer
3      and told to stop smoking.  But he also smoked when
4      he was sick with the flu and was staying home.
5      Dr. Jaffe admitted to that.  And he continued to
6      smoke after his diagnosis.
7           So a total score is eight points, which under
8      the Fagerstrom is heavily addicted, heavily
9      addicted, using the test that R.J. Reynolds uses in
10      its own clinical studies to evaluate nicotine
11      dependence.
12           So the evidence in this case, every doctor who
13      testified in this case, all four of them testified
14      that he was addicted.  Dr. Jaffe confirmed that on
15      the stand.  Dr. McCoy, Dr. Sheedy, Dr. Martin,
16      Dr. Bianco, they all say he was addicted.
17           Ask yourself if Dr. Jaffe was believable.  150
18      hours in this case?
19           Let's talk about lung cancer.  The evidence
20      was that he had lung cancer, bronchogenic carcinoma
21      caused by cigarette smoking.  It was undisputed,
22      uncontroverted evidence that smoking was the only
23      exposure Sonny Ellis had in his life to cause lung
24      cancer.  Wasn't exposed to asbestos.  He wasn't
25      exposed to radon. 3172
1           He wasn't exposed to these other things that
2      cause lung cancer.  He smoked two packs a day for
3      over 30 years.  The evidence was undisputed and
4      uncontroverted that it looked like a primary lung
5      cancer, a bronchogenic carcinoma.  "Solitary left
6      upper lobe nodule.  This is very worrisome for a
7      bronchogenic carcinoma."  Not a metastatic
8      carcinoma from somewhere else, but a bronchogenic
9      primary lung cancer.
10           It was undisputed, uncontroverted evidence
11      that when they stuck a needle into that spot in the
12      lung and drew the tissue out of that lesion in his
13      lung, it came back as large cell undifferentiated
14      carcinoma compatible with lung primary.
15           It's undisputed, uncontroverted evidence that
16      this cancer didn't start in his brain, it didn't
17      start in his spine, it didn't start in his
18      shoulder, it didn't start in his orbit.
19           Their own expert admitted that none of those
20      went to the lung.  That they could have -- that it
21      could have started in the lung, he called it a
22      distinct possibility.
23           But you remember this whole thing about them
24      wanting to have it both ways.  First he said, well,
25      that tumor in the lung was only a centimeter and a 3173
1      half, 2 centimeters, small he said.  2 centimeters
2      to an inch, I believe.  It was too small to spread
3      to all those parts, so it needed to be a bigger
4      tumor.
5           Well, they did a CT scan of the abdomen, they
6      did a CT scan of the pelvis, and they didn't find
7      any big tumor anywhere else.  He gave a whole list
8      of things, that it could have come from his testes.
9      Well, he spent two months in the hospital, saw 15
10      doctors, do you hear anything about testes cancer
11      in any of these records?  Everybody poking him and
12      prodding him and running him through all these
13      tests?
14           Nobody said anything about kidneys.  And he
15      had a scan that didn't show a big tumor in his
16      kidneys or in his bladder or in his pancreas or in
17      his esophagus.  They scanned him and it was normal.
18      The only place they saw was that spot in the lung,
19      which they biopsied, and I think Dr. Okun said the
20      tissue is the issue, and it darn sure is, and the
21      tissue was lung cancer.  And there is no question
22      about that.
23           They pulled it out and he said it's a large
24      cell carcinoma compatible with lung primary.
25           And so after saying it needed to be a big 3174
1      tumor, then they say, well, this was a really
2      aggressive one because it was undifferentiated.
3      And that's the part that we agree with him on.  It
4      was undifferentiated, you darn right, that's
5      aggressive.
6           You heard Dr. Burns talk about it, you heard
7      Dr. Okun talk about it, it's very aggressive.  You
8      can have a centimeter and a half, 2 centimeter or 3
9      centimeter nodule lesion in your lung that's cancer
10      and it can go to all those places because it's very
11      aggressive.
12           They didn't find a single tumor anywhere else
13      other than the metastatic sites and the spot in his
14      lung.  And they couldn't tell you where it came
15      from, and they admitted that it was lung -- that it
16      was -- they admitted that it was a distinct
17      possibility that it was lung cancer, but every
18      single one of his doctors said it was lung cancer.
19           And showing you Mr. Ellis's medical records is
20      not an exercise in quantity over quality that
21      Dr. Okun said.  That was -- you evaluate what you
22      think of that statement in the context of the
23      physicians who worked hard trying to help
24      Mr. Ellis, whether that was not quality, it was
25      just quantity. 3175
1           And you evaluate the way he would say it was a
2      fact if he liked it, but if he didn't like it, it
3      was just an opinion.  When he liked what Dr. Bilek
4      said about unknown primary, that was a fact.
5           When he didn't like it when Dr. Bilek said it
6      was a bronchogenic -- biopsy-proven bronchogenic
7      carcinoma in September and December and late
8      January and on February 8, two weeks before
9      Mr. Ellis died, his office is calling it lung
10      cancer and he's signing off on it?  They didn't
11      show you that.  We had to show you that.
12           But evaluate Dr. Okun, who, on direct
13      examination, could tell you the thought processes
14      of the doctors who were writing these medical
15      records but somehow lost that ability when he was
16      on cross-examination.
17           Ask yourselves how it was that R.J. Reynolds'
18      expert knew what Dr. Burgert meant.  On direct exam
19      when Dr. Burgert -- if you can put that path report
20      up, Jeff, when Dr. Burgert said that it was a large
21      cell undifferentiated cancer compatible with lung
22      primary, to Dr. Okun that somehow meant that it was
23      not lung cancer.
24           But then all the other doctors who knew
25      Dr. Burgert and worked with Dr. Burgert, all of 3176
1      them interpreted that same path report as primary
2      lung cancer.  In fact, Dr. Bilek said that it was a
3      biopsy-proven bronchogenic carcinoma.
4           Every doctor that knew Dr. Burgert, the
5      pathologist who made that diagnosis, knew that he
6      meant lung cancer.
7           And here is where the evidence really comes
8      down on this.  More doctors than we can even
9      identify in the medical record said it was lung
10      cancer.  The best they've got is I ain't sure.
11      It's a distinct possibility.
12           So was cancer the cause of his death?
13      Dr. Okun is not sure, but he did say, if you
14      recall, that the cancer is what caused his death,
15      he's just not sure if it started in the lung.  But
16      Dr. Sheedy, Dr. McCoy, and Dr. Burns, and the death
17      certificate is in evidence, that he died from
18      metastatic lung cancer.
19           And ask yourself, you know, what else does
20      addiction do but cause you to repeatedly expose
21      yourself to what it is you are addicted to?  And
22      the problem with smoking is if you are addicted to
23      the nicotine and you expose yourself to that
24      cigarette smoke over and over again and get that
25      nicotine and, unfortunately, all the carcinogens 3177
1      come with it.
2           That's why nicotine addiction causes people to
3      die, and that's why nicotine addiction causes
4      people to get diseases like COPD.  And we're not
5      claiming damages for Mr. Ellis's COPD, the law
6      wouldn't allow us to do that because he died of
7      lung cancer and that's our claim.
8           But did you hear any evidence in this case
9      from R.J. Reynolds that cigarette smoking didn't
10      cause his COPD?  You heard the testimony,
11      uncontroverted testimony that COPD was caused by
12      cigarette smoking, but then they turn around and
13      say that, oh, well, we're not sure cigarette
14      smoking causes lung cancer.
15           So we have two packs a day for 34 years.  And
16      let's show the dosage demonstrative.  You get eight
17      to ten inhales per cigarette.  So eight to ten
18      inhales per cigarette -- per -- per cigarette, and
19      20 cigarettes in a pack, two packs a day, that's 40
20      cigarettes, 40 times eight, that's 320 to 400 hits
21      of nicotine every day.  4 million hits over his
22      lifetime.  And with each one of those doses of
23      nicotine comes all those carcinogens.
24           And the defendant didn't call anyone to say
25      that Mr. Ellis was immune to this powerfully 3178
1      addictive drug.  They didn't explain to you how it
2      would even be possible to expose yourself to a drug
3      like that that many times for that long and not be
4      addicted.
5           So on verdict form question 1, you know, the
6      issue there is not whether Mr. Ellis had free
7      choice.  The plaintiff hasn't come here saying that
8      he lacked the ability to make a choice.
9           The issue isn't whether Sonny Ellis was unable
10      to control himself, because we know he was
11      physically able to control his actions.  The issue
12      isn't whether addiction took over Sonny Ellis's
13      life completely.  The issue is whether addiction
14      was a substantial contributing factor, one of many
15      causes.
16           And ask yourselves, if Sonny Ellis wasn't
17      addicted to nicotine, would he have exposed himself
18      to dozens of carcinogens day after day after day
19      for 40 years?
20           And if Sonny Ellis wasn't addicted to
21      nicotine, would he have smoked until he died while
22      undergoing surgery to remove vertebral bodies out
23      of his spine that had cancer in them?  Because he
24      wants to live.  And he's undergoing all this
25      treatment. 3179
1           Look at the medical records.  He had a
2      horrible, horrible time in the last five months of
3      his life trying to live.  Why would -- what other
4      reason would he have to smoke other than nicotine
5      addiction?
6           Was R.J. Reynolds wrong when they told
7      themselves that people smoke for nicotine, that
8      "nicotine is the sine qua non of cigarettes,
9      without which cigarettes would not exist"?  Were
10      they wrong?  Were they wrong when they said, "If we
11      take the nicotine too low, people will stop
12      smoking"?  Were they wrong when they said, "Most
13      people can't quit"?
14           Their internal documents show that's what R.J.
15      Reynolds believes when they're talking to
16      themselves.  They were right about nicotine being
17      addictive.  They were right about why it is people
18      can't stop.  And they were right about it causing
19      cancer.  And without addiction, people don't smoke
20      until they get these diseases and die.
21           Now, if you answer yes to question 1 on the
22      verdict form, Sonny Ellis -- you will have found
23      Sonny Ellis is a member of the Engle class.  If you
24      answer no, then Mrs. Ellis loses and R.J. Reynolds
25      wins and it's over, you'll have pinned a blue 3180
1      ribbon on R.J. Reynolds.
2           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
3           THE COURT:  Sustain.
4           MR. PERSONS:  It's an improper argument.  Move
5      to strike.
6           THE COURT:  It's granted.
7           MR. GUSTAFSON:  A yes answer, though, that
8      means that the Engle findings apply.
9           The Engle findings are that "cigarette smoking
10      causes lung cancer" and it lists the one that Sonny
11      Ellis had, large cell carcinoma.  "Nicotine in
12      cigarettes is addictive.  R.J. Reynolds placed
13      cigarettes on the market that were defective and
14      unreasonably dangerous.  R.J. Reynolds was
15      negligent.  R.J. Reynolds concealed or omitted
16      material information not otherwise known or
17      available, knowing that the material was false or
18      misleading or failed to disclose a material fact
19      concerning the health effects or addictive nature
20      of smoking cigarettes or both.
21           And that Reynolds agreed with other cigarette
22      manufacturers and corporations to conceal or omit
23      information regarding the health effects of
24      cigarette smoking or the addictive nature of
25      cigarettes with the intention that smokers and 3181
1      members of the public would rely on this
2      information to their detriment."
3           Those findings are binding on the jury and the
4      Court and parties if you answer yes to question 1.
5           Now, the Engle findings were the result of a
6      trial lasting over a year.  There wasn't any effort
7      to reprove Engle findings in this trial.  We had a
8      four and a half days of the plaintiff's case.
9      There is no way we could try to reprove the Engle
10      findings here.
11           What we did was show you how those kinds of
12      things affect people like Sonny Ellis and how they,
13      in fact, affected Sonny Ellis, how he responded to
14      their message, how it was that cigarettes are so
15      addictive that Sonny Ellis smoked until he died.
16           This is one of those stories that only has one
17      side.  There is no other side to the story of this
18      tobacco company and the other co-conspirators and
19      what they did.  Agreeing to lie to smokers,
20      agreeing to conceal what they knew to be true about
21      causing cancer and addiction, carrying that scheme
22      to lie to the American people for almost 50 years,
23      all for money, didn't matter who died, didn't
24      matter how many, they didn't care.  Money.
25           Question 2 on the verdict form is concealment. 3182
1      "Was R.J. Reynolds' concealment or omission of
2      material information about the health effects or
3      addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, or both, a
4      legal cause of Clarence C. Ellis's death?"
5           When an addicted smoker tries to quit smoking
6      and they fail and they're told it's just because of
7      their behavior, that they're choosing to pick
8      cigarettes up one more time, that they don't know
9      how powerfully addictive nicotine is, they don't
10      know that the company that they're buying the
11      cigarettes from is putting ammonia in the
12      cigarettes so they freebase the nicotine to their
13      addicted brain, they don't know that the company is
14      putting things like levulinic acid in it and
15      monkeying with the pH to make it more inhalable,
16      therefore, making it more addictive, they don't
17      know that.
18           All of that stuff is withheld from Sonny
19      Ellis.  Ask yourselves if you knew that when you
20      showed up for this trial, did you know those
21      things, it's 2014, and if you learned those things
22      here, ask yourself how it is that R.J. Reynolds can
23      say Sonny Ellis should have known himself.
24           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  Golden
25      rule. 3183
1           THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. GUSTAFSON:  You know now that Reynolds
3      sold defective and unreasonably dangerous
4      cigarettes.  You know now what Reynolds was doing
5      to those cigarettes.  You know now that Reynolds
6      knew that their cigarettes were addictive and that
7      they designed them to be that way, and they lied
8      about it.  You know now that Reynolds knew that
9      addiction made it so most of their customers
10      couldn't stop.  And Reynolds lied about that.
11           And you -- Reynolds knew that their customers
12      would get addicted and that addiction would lead to
13      what they call unattractive side effects, like lung
14      cancer.  And they lied about that.  And those are
15      exactly the things that happened to Mr. Ellis.
16           And you know that, that when they say that
17      smoking is a choice, that they were doing
18      everything they could to engineer cigarettes and
19      add things to them to make it really, really hard
20      to carry through on that choice.
21           Because what they say is very different than
22      what they do.  You know that now.
[#DELETED RECESS#]
[#DELETED MOTION FOR MISTRIAL#]
12           MR. GUSTAFSON:  May it please the Court?
13           THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
14           MR. GUSTAFSON:  Sonny Ellis died February 26,
15      1993.  Two days ago was the 21st anniversary of
16      Sonny Ellis's death.  He died in 1993.  And was
17      there any evidence that Sonny Ellis knew that the
18      defendant was putting additives in his cigarettes?
19      Was there any evidence that he knew there was
20      ammonia being added to it?
21           Was there any evidence that he knew that they
22      were manipulating the pH?  Was there any evidence
23      that he knew that they were engineering the
24      cigarettes he smoked to be addictive?  And there is
25      not because they kept that to themselves.  And so 3188
1      Sonny Ellis blamed his behavior on himself.  He
2      would get tearful when he tried to quit.  Because
3      the message from the companies was it's your
4      behavior, it's not anything we do, even though they
5      know they're doing it, this is your behavior.
6           But, you know, knowledge is a powerful thing.
7      When you know why it is that you can't quit, when
8      you know why it is that you keep smoking, just like
9      Dr. Daniel Horn said in that slide that we showed
10      you and in Dr. Burns's testimony, when Dr. Horn
11      said people need to know why it is they can't stop
12      smoking, they need to know why it is they smoke.
13      Sonny Ellis didn't know those things.
14           The defendant kept those things to themself.
15      And they tell you it's just Sonny Ellis's behavior,
16      it's just his choice.  Well, that's true -- if
17      that's true that smoking is just a choice, and
18      addiction doesn't play a role in it, nicotine
19      doesn't have nothing to do with it, you know, lay
20      aside why they are monkeying with it, doing all the
21      stuff they are doing to cigarettes to increase
22      addiction and maximize -- let's put all that aside,
23      if it's really true what R.J. Reynolds is saying,
24      people just smoking because they want to smoke and
25      nicotine addiction doesn't got nothing to do with 3189
1      it and it's just your behavior, it's just your
2      fault, if that's true, why would Sonny Ellis need
3      to go to the doctor to stop doing something that he
4      just was voluntarily doing?  Why would he need to
5      go to the doctor.
6           It kind of gives you a window into his thought
7      process.  Why would he need to go to the doctor if
8      it's just, hey, I'll just change my behavior?  But
9      I keep failing.  And I don't like failing in front
10      of my family.  I don't like failing in front of my
11      wife.  10, 15 times Betty said he tried to quit,
12      over and over and over again.  And you know now why
13      it is he couldn't do it.
14           Now, the concealment instruction, the
15      instruction that goes with this question number 2,
16      is a long instruction, but it's that important
17      thing again.  It has to be a legal cause if it
18      directly and in a natural and continuous sequence
19      produces or contributes substantially to producing
20      Mr. Ellis's lung cancer and death.
21           And then there is that instruction again that
22      I told you about before where the law recognizes
23      the complexities of life and how more than one
24      thing works together to create an outcome.  The law
25      recognizes that.  In order to be regarded as a 3190
1      legal cause of cancer and death, the fraud by
2      concealment or omission need not be the only cause.
3      It can be a legal cause even though it operates in
4      combination with the act of another or some other
5      cause.
6           Here the addiction combines with the
7      defendant's concealment of the truth.  And then
8      with their conspiracy with the other companies to
9      conceal the truth and to create the Tobacco
10      Institute to go out and lie to people and put stuff
11      in the newspaper.  And Council For Tobacco
12      Research.  Research that doesn't have nothing to do
13      with cigarette smoking.
14           You get to question number 3 on the verdict
15      form, which is similar to the concealment question,
16      except this time it's the conspiracy to conceal.
17      "Was R.J. Reynolds' agreement with the other
18      cigarette manufacturers and corporations to conceal
19      or omit information regarding the health effects of
20      cigarettes or their addictive nature a legal cause
21      of Clarence C. Ellis's death?"
22           Similar to concealment except this time
23      they're all conspiring to do it.  So they get to
24      borrow everything their co-conspirators did
25      bringing in here with you.  And that's why we show 3191
1      you Philip Morris documents, Lorillard documents,
2      documents of other companies, because they were all
3      in this together.
4           And the issue here is not whether information
5      on the harms of smoking was available.  We know
6      that.  We know that the information was out there.
7      You didn't hear the plaintiffs say -- we brought
8      the people that tried to get the information out
9      there, their whole career, that's who our expert
10      witnesses were.
11           The issue isn't whether Sonny Ellis ever saw a
12      warning on a pack of cigarettes.  The issue is
13      whether Reynolds's false controversy was a
14      substantial contributing factor, one cause among
15      many causes.  And that gets us to those articles on
16      the refrigerator.  Betty Ellis said her husband
17      would try to quit smoking and he failed.  And then
18      he wouldn't be ready right now because he'd just
19      failed, and that can be a shattering experience.
20           And it's in those times that addicted people,
21      like Sonny Ellis, latch onto things, like a
22      psychological crutch.  Here is a Philip Morris
23      document, right, in 1964, when the Surgeon
24      General's Report is going to come out, the first
25      big one in 1964 that says cigarette smoking causes 3192
1      lung cancer in men, and they're all trying to
2      figure out what are we going to do, and here we go,
3      "We must in the near future provide some answers
4      which will give smokers a psychological crutch and
5      self-rationale to continue smoking."  Then when
6      somebody actually does what they want, they come in
7      here and say, well, it's your fault, shouldn't do
8      this.
9           Do they get it both ways?  Are y'all going to
10      tolerate that?
11           They continued his whole life.  What was the
12      testimony on it?  He repetitively brought home
13      cuttings out of the newspaper articles, he put them
14      on the refrigerator door.  When they said you ought
15      to quit, he would bring them over and say, here, it
16      hadn't been proven, the evidence isn't there.
17           Betty Ellis, "He started gathering articles on
18      smoking and health.  Numerous times he would put it
19      on the refrigerator with a magnet.  They would
20      reference not being harmful.  He wanted people to
21      know he wasn't doing anything wrong."
22           The defendants admit that it was reasonable
23      for Sonny Ellis to rely on what they said, not just
24      back in the '60s, but in the '70s and '80s and
25      '90s.  Robert Heimann was the CEO of American 3193
1      Tobacco Company at one point.  "Our advertising is
2      truthful.  We anticipate they would rely on it if
3      they chose.
4           "It's a promise as to what the consumer can
5      expect from their product?
6           "Yes, it is."
7           And then what does he say?
8           "Would you put the warning on there if
9      Congress didn't require it?
10           "No.  We believe our product is not injurious
11      to health."
12           He says, "The Surgeon General is misguided in
13      telling them they got to put warnings on there.
14           "Not being polite about it, in your opinion,
15      the Surgeon General is wrong?"
16           He says, "Dead wrong."
17           That was their message and they wanted people
18      to rely on it.  It was reasonable to rely.
19           Look at James Johnston, the CEO of R.J.
20      Reynolds Tobacco, 1992 testimony.  "We expect our
21      customers to take in all available information and
22      make their own judgments about the risks versus the
23      benefits."
24           It's reasonable.
25           "Specifically you think it was reasonable for 3194
1      your customers, the smokers of your cigarettes, to
2      believe what you said and rely upon what you
3      publicly said in these advertisements?"
4           And that's a 1984 Tallahassee Democrat, full
5      page ad, "Can we have an open debate about
6      smoking?"
7           And he said, "That would be reasonable, that's
8      why they put them out."
9           This program of deceit made a difference with
10      a lot of Americans, and Sonny Ellis was one of
11      them.  Where else would Mr. Ellis have gotten the
12      message that it wasn't proven that cigarettes cause
13      disease?  What evidence did you see that someone
14      else was saying that other than the defendant and
15      its co-conspirators?
16           Nothing.  You know now where that message came
17      from.  They brought you nothing to show it was
18      somebody else.  That industry message capitalized
19      on this American tradition, fairness that we have.
20      You don't just level accusations at people unless
21      you're darn sure that you're right and you can
22      prove it.
23           And they made it seem like the proof was
24      lacking.  And they tried to make a controversy here
25      that somehow Mr. Ellis, whose only exposure was 3195
1      smoking cigarettes, somehow got cancer from
2      something else.  But they brought you nothing on
3      what it was.
4           They made it seem unfair to blame cigarettes
5      for something that wasn't proven, and it started
6      when Sonny Ellis was a child.  R.J. Reynolds,
7      "Let's look at the growing importance of the young
8      adult in the cigarette market.  In 1960, this young
9      adult market, this 14 to 24 age group, represented
10      21 percent of the population."  That was Sonny
11      Ellis's age group.
12           "They represent tomorrow's cigarette business.
13      As this group matures, they will account for a key
14      share of the total cigarette volume for at least
15      the next 25 years."  That's why they use ammoniated
16      reconstituted tobacco and levulinic acid and monkey
17      with the pH, because these people represent their
18      business for the next 25 years and they want to
19      keep them.
20           "Ammonia is the key to competing in smoke
21      quality with Philip Morris worldwide.  The US
22      cigarette industry uses about 10 million pounds of
23      it a year.  10 milligrams of ammonia compounds per
24      cigarette produced."  That's how much they go
25      through. 3196
1           "Smoke pH and free nicotine."  Dr. Teague.  "A
2      cigarette is a system for delivery for nicotine to
3      the smoker in an attractive, useful form.  At
4      normal smoke pH, below 6.  All the smoked nicotine
5      is chemically combined with acidic substances and
6      it's non-volitive and slowly absorbed.
7           As the smoke pH increases above 6, an
8      increasing proportion of the smoke occurs in free
9      form, which is volatile, rapidly absorbed by the
10      smoker and believed to be instantly perceived as
11      nicotine kick."
12           They made it so people freebased nicotine, not
13      just smoking a cigarette, they were freebasing
14      nicotine.  "In addition to enhancing nicotine kick,
15      increasing the pH of the smoke above 6 causes other
16      changes, particularly when the increase in smoke pH
17      is achieved by adding ammonia to the blend."
18           "Recent investigations indicate that natural
19      or added ammonia and its salts in tobacco and smoke
20      play an important role in determining the acidity
21      or alkalinity, the pH, of the smoke.  This in turn
22      determines the amounts of free and combined
23      nicotine present in smoke, which strongly
24      influences the way in which the nicotine is
25      perceived by the smoker." 3197
1           "Recent experience in smoking cigarettes known
2      to deliver abnormally high concentrations of
3      ammonia or ammonium salts indicates that a
4      significant stimulation occurs.  Increased rate and
5      force of heartbeat, tremor, and sweating, similar
6      to that caused by increased adrenaline."
7           "If, as suggested, ammonia and its salts in
8      smoke are found to make desirable contributions to
9      the physiological satisfactions derived from
10      smoking, we will want to optimize this effect in
11      existing and slash or new products."
12           And what was in Sonny Ellis's products?
13      Ammoniated reconstituted tobacco.
14           And what do they put in their cigarettes today
15      on their website?  Ammonium hydroxide.  Ethyl
16      levulinate, which you've learned was levulinic
17      acid.
18           But you know how it began because in 1953, you
19      see that dip on the blue line, 1953 there is a drop
20      in sales because the new information is coming out
21      that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer.  Now,
22      they say everybody had known for hundreds of years.
23           But when it hits the newspaper, people stop
24      buying cigarettes.  So they hire a public relations
25      firm, and they go to the Plaza Hotel and they come 3198
1      up with their plan.  The PR firm finds out what it
2      was the companies knew.
3           You'll find some interesting opinions.  One of
4      the men said, "It's fortunate for us that
5      cigarettes are a habit that they can't break.
6      Wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was the
7      first to produce a cancer-free cigarette."
8           They needed to keep this knowledge to
9      themselves while making others think they were
10      being honest so they come out with the Frank
11      Statement.  We accept an interest in people's
12      health.  Our products are not injurious.
13           This has been going on for 300 years and every
14      one of those claims that tobacco causes disease has
15      been abandoned for lack of evidence.  They are
16      going to accept responsibility for the health of
17      their customers.
18           They knew they were lying.  They reflected on
19      how they were lying.  "Our basic position in the
20      cigarette controversy is subject to the charge that
21      we are making false or misleading statements to
22      promote the sale of cigarettes."
23           They knew someday they were going to get
24      caught.  Chickens do come home.
25           1968, they attack the Surgeon General with 3199
1      their report on "It's a shockingly intemperate
2      defamation of an industry which led the way in
3      research."  They were withholding research.  They
4      were withholding what they knew to be true about
5      cigarettes causing cancer and being addictive.
6           They called the Surgeon General a liar in
7      1972.  "The extent to which the public health
8      officials may knowingly mislead the American
9      public."  How did this work for them?
10           You saw all those newspaper articles, and I
11      ain't going to go through all that again, but you
12      saw it, they had TV time, they had newspaper time,
13      they got their say too.  How did it work?  They
14      tell us how it worked.  They tell us for nearly 20
15      years, we employed a single strategy to defend
16      ourself on three major fronts:  Litigation,
17      politics, and public opinion.  It was brilliantly
18      conceived and executed over the years helping us
19      win important battles.  We want to create doubt
20      about the health charge.
21           We learned that the industry outspent public
22      health authorities in the US government by several
23      hundred times.  "The National Commission on Smoking
24      and Public Policy reported in 1978 that the tobacco
25      industry spent more on advertising cigarettes in 3200
1      one day than the National Clearinghouse on Smoking
2      and Health, the government's primary agency working
3      in this area, spent in one year."  They spent more
4      in a day than the government spent in a year.
5           They agreed to conceal what they knew.  That
6      their customers had physiological requirements for
7      nicotine.  That they applied nicotine to cigarettes
8      to meet that requirement.  They agreed to conceal
9      cigarettes were addictive, caused cancer.  They
10      agreed to conceal that they experimented with
11      freebasing nicotine.  They likened their customers
12      to rats in a lab cage, where the rat pushes the
13      lever for food.
14           It continued into the '80s.  Nationwide media
15      campaign in 1984.  "Can we have an open debate
16      about smoking?"  This is published by R.J.
17      Reynolds.  "Over the years, you've heard so many
18      negative reports about smoking and health and so
19      little to challenge these reports, you may assume
20      the case against smoking is closed.  But this is
21      far from the truth."
22           And it continued into the '90s.  They lied to
23      Congress.
24           (Video clip played as follows:)
25           SPEAKER:  I would like you to rise and those 3201
1      who will be testifying as well with you to rise.
2      Would you raise your right hand?  Do you swear that
3      the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
4      the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
5           THE WITNESSES:  I do.
6           SPEAKER:  Please consider yourself to be under
7      oath.
8           REPRESENTATIVE WYDEN:  Let me begin my
9      questioning on the matter of whether or not
10      nicotine is addictive.  Let me ask you first, and I
11      would like to just go down the row, whether each of
12      you believes that nicotine is not addictive.  I
13      heard virtually all of you touch on it and just yes
14      or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
15           MR. CAMPBELL:  I believe nicotine is not
16      addictive, yes.
17           MR. WYDEN:  Mr. Johnston.
18           MR. JAMES JOHNSTON:  Congressman, cigarettes
19      and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
20      definitions of addiction.  There is no
21      intoxication.
22           REPRESENTATIVE WYDEN:  We'll take that as a
23      no.  And again, time is short if you can just -- I
24      think each of you believe nicotine is not
25      addictive, and we just would like to have this for 3202
1      the record.
2           MR. TADDEO:  I don't believe that nicotine or
3      our products are addictive.
4           MR. TISCH:  I believe nicotine is not
5      addictive.
6           MR. HORRIGAN:  I believe that nicotine is not
7      addictive.
8           MR. SANDEFUR:  I believe that nicotine is not
9      addictive.
10           MR. DONALD JOHNSTON:  And I too believe that
11      nicotine is not addictive.
12           REPRESENTATIVE WAXMAN:  Mr. Campbell, you were
13      also deposed, and you said, quote, to my knowledge,
14      it has not been proven that cigarette smoking
15      causes cancer.  This is a rather passive and
16      puzzling approach especially in light of the
17      consensus, not by some but all of the scientific
18      community.
19           Will you ever be convinced?  And what evidence
20      are you waiting for?  And let's have the microphone
21      passed over, please.
22           MR. CAMPBELL:  Yes, I may be convinced.  We
23      don't know what causes cancer in general right now,
24      so I think that we may find out what causes cancer
25      and we may find out some relationship, which is yet 3203
1      to be proven.
2           (Video clip stopped.)
3           MR. GUSTAFSON:  The evidence in this case is
4      that from time to time, Sonny Ellis would take
5      these kinds of statements and he would cut them out
6      of the newspaper and put them on his refrigerator.
7      There isn't any evidence that he didn't do that.
8      Everyone said he did that.  His wife said it.  His
9      kids said it.  He relied on what these people were
10      saying.
11           When you get to questions 2 and 3 on the
12      verdict form, given the evidence in this case, the
13      answers to those questions ought to be yes.
14           And that brings us to question 4.  As Ms.
15      Ellis has said all along, her husband shares in the
16      responsibility.  The judge read to you what her
17      position was in this case, is that he bears
18      responsibility in combination with Reynolds.
19           She came here insisting on her husband sharing
20      in that responsibility.  Now, the defendant tries
21      to say that he's totally at fault.  And what's he
22      totally at fault for?  Because their -- their
23      defense in this case, what they presented to you,
24      was he's not addicted, he doesn't have lung cancer,
25      and if he did have lung cancer, it wasn't caused by 3204
1      cigarette smoke.
2           So how could it be that Mr. Ellis has any
3      fault in this case if Reynolds is taking those
4      positions?  How can they say that he's at fault if
5      they're saying that cigarette smoking didn't cause
6      his lung cancer?  What's he at fault for?  If
7      smoking didn't do it, why is he at fault?
8           Listen carefully to what they say about that.
9      Because they don't get it both ways, see.
10           So you -- you contrast Ms. Ellis taking
11      responsibility.  And even though the defendant
12      promised in 1954 they accepted responsibility --
13           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, and I
14      have a --
15           THE COURT:  Okay, let's go sidebar.
16           (The following is at the bench.)
17           MR. PERSONS:  Object to the comment about the
18      refusal to take responsibility.  That was on the
19      very tips of his lips when the objection was made.
20      The preface to it was that even though they had
21      promised back in 1954 before the Frank Statement,
22      which had just been shown to the jury in the past
23      few minutes, and then he was going to couple that
24      with they still refuse to take responsibility.
25           That's clearly improper, and I move for a 3205
1      mistrial on that basis.  There is no requirement
2      that the defendant in this case at this trial has
3      an obligation to take responsibility for what
4      happened to Mr. Ellis.
5           MR. GUSTAFSON:  I haven't said that.  He said
6      I was fixing to say it, but I didn't say it.  And I
7      ain't going to say it.  I was going to say I'm
8      allowed to comment on the evidence.
9           THE COURT:  Um-hum (affirmative).
10           MR. GUSTAFSON:  And the evidence is they
11      promised to take responsibility, accept
12      responsibility.
13           MR. SALES:  In 1954.
14           MR. GUSTAFSON:  In 1954, and that's what I
15      said, and then they didn't take responsibility
16      during his lifetime.  I was not going to say that
17      they ain't taking responsibility here, because I
18      know there is an order in place where I'm not
19      allowed to say that and I didn't say that.
20           So he's a little quick on the draw moving for
21      a mistrial on something I didn't say and wasn't
22      going to say and ain't going to say.
23           THE COURT:  What is your position if he
24      says -- if his argument is they promised to take
25      responsibility in 1954 and didn't during Mr. 3206
1      Ellis's life, and he stops there, what's your
2      position on that?
3           MR. PERSONS:  I think he -- I think that's
4      permissible.
5           THE COURT:  Okay.
6           MR. PERSONS:  I think that's within the ambit
7      of the order.
8           THE COURT:  Okay.  Here is what I think.
9      Actually, I think Mr. Persons' objecting quickly is
10      a good thing, not a bad thing.  So I think he --
11      I'm going to overrule the objection, deny the
12      motion for a mistrial, with the notation that the
13      statement was not completed by plaintiff's counsel,
14      and I think we have an understanding on that topic
15      what's permissible and what isn't.
16           MR. SALES:  Okay.
17           THE COURT:  So just leave it.
18           MR. GUSTAFSON:  I would appreciate it if I got
19      to make my closing argument without people
20      objecting to things I haven't said.  I'm entitled
21      to make a closing argument, and any objection
22      should come on things I say, if I say something
23      wrong, not something they think I'm going to say.
24           THE COURT:  Well, okay.  But that goes both
25      ways. 3207
1           MR. GUSTAFSON:  Sure.
2           THE COURT:  All right.  I just think we ought
3      to keep going.
4           MR. PERSONS:  All right, sir.
5           THE COURT:  Okay.
6           (In open court.)
7           THE COURT:  You may proceed.
8           MR. GUSTAFSON:  Please the Court, Your Honor.
9           As I was saying, Ms. Ellis takes
10      responsibility for her husband's role in this.  But
11      even though the defendant promised in 1954 that
12      they accepted responsibility for the health of
13      their customers and they were going to look after
14      their customers, they never did that in Sonny
15      Ellis's lifetime.  They never did that.  Sonny
16      Ellis relied on them.
17           Now, the hearing, the congressional hearing
18      where the executives testified to Congress, that
19      occurred the year after Sonny Ellis died.  They
20      continued the same program long after Sonny Ellis
21      died, for years after he died.  But he relied on
22      the things that they said.
23           So when you get to the comparative negligence
24      question, you are going to have an instruction on
25      it.  The plaintiff has admitted that her husband 3208
1      bears partial fault here in combination with the
2      acts of Reynolds and that you should determine the
3      extent to which Mr. Ellis's negligence was itself a
4      contributing legal cause of his cancer and death
5      and then you should write on the verdict form the
6      percentage of fault chargeable.
7           Now, Reynolds can deny that their program of
8      deceit contributed to causing Sonny Ellis's
9      addiction and death.  They can say that.  And none
10      of my comments are ever made about Reynolds's
11      lawyers.  This has nothing to do with their
12      lawyers.  This has to do with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
13      Company.  This is what I'm talking about.
14           You know, behind closed doors in their board
15      rooms and in their science labs, they celebrated
16      how successful their lies and deceit were in
17      keeping people smoking because what they say is
18      very different from what they do.  Their own
19      documents tell you that.  They design these
20      cigarettes to be as addictive as possible.
21           You heard testimony about those additives and
22      how they take the nicotine out in the process and
23      put it back in, and the ammonia, making the smoke
24      easier to inhale.  All of that was to make
25      cigarettes more addictive and keep smokers smoking, 3209
1      making quitting as hard as they could, take away
2      someone's choice.
3           And so if you compare the parties, Sonny Ellis
4      was someone who was honest and loyal and
5      trustworthy, and meanwhile R.J. Reynolds is
6      engineering cigarettes to be addictive, putting
7      additives in them, celebrating how successful their
8      plan was in keeping people smoking, you're going to
9      have to have a decision to make about how it is
10      you're going to divvy up the fault for that on that
11      claim.
12           And so you know that the companies recognize,
13      you know, internally, that they "Can't defend
14      continued smoking as free choice if the person was
15      addicted."  But they're going to tell you that he
16      had an unfettered free choice to stop smoking here
17      and that addiction had nothing to do with it.
18      Because to these companies, they're so accustomed
19      to knowing one thing and saying another.
20           To them, it didn't matter what Sonny Ellis did
21      as long as he went to the store and bought another
22      pack.  If he quit, he should have quit sooner.  If
23      he didn't quit, he chose to smoke.  Heads, they
24      win, tails, everyone else loses.
25           And you need to keep in mind this jury 3210
1      instruction tells you that R.J. Reynolds is legally
2      responsible for the American Tobacco Company and
3      Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, because
4      they all merged.  Those three companies are now
5      R.J. Reynolds.
6           And so it's three of them and it's one of Mr.
7      Ellis.  And ask yourself, who knew more?  Who knew
8      more about addiction?  Who knew more about
9      monkeying with cigarettes?  Who knew more about
10      causing lung cancer and COPD and other diseases?
11      Was it Sonny Ellis or was it those guys?
12           This decision is yours and yours alone when
13      you get to this.  As all these answers to all these
14      questions are.  These are your decisions.  I'm
15      going to make a suggestion to you that you put 20
16      percent on Sonny Ellis and you put 80 percent on
17      Reynolds.  Look at the documents.  Look at what
18      happened here.  The defendant is going to tell you
19      to put a hundred percent of fault on Mr. Ellis.
20      And if you do that, Mrs. Ellis loses and R.J.
21      Reynolds wins.
22           I want you to think about this.  The defendant
23      says that Mr. Ellis didn't die from lung cancer
24      despite the evidence from all his treating doctors
25      that lung cancer is what he had and what killed 3211
1      him.  The defendant says that Mr. Ellis died from
2      something that had nothing to do with smoking.
3           And then the defendant tells you it's all
4      Sonny Ellis's fault because he chose to smoke.
5      Now, if he didn't die from smoking, how is it all
6      Sonny Ellis's fault choosing to smoke if you take
7      their position?  How can it possibly be both?  It
8      can't.  It can't.  It's neither.
9           So you get to question 5 on the verdict form,
10      "What is the total amount of damages sustained by
11      plaintiff Betty Jean Ellis for the loss of Clarence
12      C. Ellis's companionship and protection and for her
13      pain and suffering as a result of Clarence C.
14      Ellis's injury and death?"
15           This is always the hard part because the
16      instruction which you need to follow when you
17      answer this question -- you know, the instruction
18      tells you there is no standard way of measuring
19      this.
20           So what happens when your best friend, person
21      you grew up with, person you had children with,
22      person you raised a family with and spent your life
23      with, what happens when you learn that they're
24      dying and there is not much time left?
25           You hang onto every day, you try to make the 3212
1      most of every day, and you try not to think that
2      this is really happening and the end is really
3      coming and you watch the love of your life waste
4      away in front of you.
5           Sonny Ellis died a relentless, painful,
6      frightening death.  You heard Dr. Sheedy say he was
7      in a wheelchair when he started seeing him in
8      January.  He had spine surgery and radiation and
9      all.
10           What happens when your spouse dies at 56 years
11      old?  Betty Ellis lost everything.  She's been
12      alone for 21 years.  21 years two days ago.  That
13      house she loved that Sonny bought her that day, she
14      couldn't live there anymore.
15           She's lived alone for 21 years, she hasn't
16      dated, she didn't want to, she's never been
17      interested in anybody else, and you know you'd have
18      heard about it if she was.  She spent 15 years
19      trying to figure out what he was trying to say to
20      her from his deathbed.
21           And the fact that he died at 56, a really
22      young age, 21 years ago, really only magnifies the
23      enormity of that loss that she has experienced for
24      21 years.  He was supposed to live another 22
25      years. 3213
1           The mortality tables we published to you say
2      that.  They're not binding on you, as the jury
3      instruction says, but that's the best we've got to
4      go on.  He had a 22-year life expectancy at the
5      time of his death.  21 years two days ago.  He's
6      supposed to still be here with her.
7           And the decision of what you put on question 5
8      again is yours and yours alone.  I'm not going to
9      suggest a number to you.  I've got three things to
10      say to you about answering this question.  The
11      first one is, y'all need to follow the jury
12      instruction.  You need to do what the judge tells
13      you to do if you're going to answer this question.
14      Follow that instruction.
15           The second thing that you do, and I'm not
16      suggesting a number to you, but I'm asking you,
17      please, whatever you do, don't you award more than
18      $10 million.  That would be too much.  We don't
19      want you to do that.  Whatever number you're going
20      to put on question number 5 should not be more than
21      $10 million.
22           The other thing, the third thing I want to
23      tell you about answering question number 5 is if
24      you choose to answer that question, the number that
25      you put there needs to be respectful of Betty 3214
1      Ellis's loss.  I'm not going to suggest a number to
2      you.  Y'all have more life experience than me.
3           If you get to question number 6, "Under the
4      circumstances of this case, state whether you find
5      by clear and convincing evidence that punitive
6      damages are warranted against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
7      Company."
8           The entire time that Sonny Ellis smoked, from
9      the time he drew on his first cigarette as a boy to
10      the last one he smoked, this defendant knew that
11      cigarettes were highly, powerfully addictive and
12      caused lung cancer, and they lied about it.
13           And behind closed doors, when the rest of us
14      weren't around to hear what they were saying and
15      see what they were writing in their little
16      documents to one another, they bragged to each
17      other about how smart and successful they were in
18      this whole program, how much money they were
19      making.  Without even looking at their internal
20      documents that tell us they knew their plan worked,
21      you can see what a difference the truth makes
22      today.
23           In Sonny Ellis's generation, 70 percent of
24      people in his age group smoked cigarettes.  Today,
25      these companies are required to tell the truth. 3215
1      Today, one in five Americans smoke.  One in five.
2      It used to be one in two back when they were lying.
3      See, the truth, the truth is powerful, and the
4      truth makes a difference.
5           And Reynolds's deceit made them a whole lot of
6      money.  And they spent a lot pedaling the lives
7      that we've been showing you.  Remember I showed you
8      that interrogatory answer.  The money that Reynolds
9      and American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson Tobacco
10      Corporation spent just on the Tobacco Institute
11      from 1958 till they went out of business in 1998 or
12      '99 was $330 million.
13           They don't have a problem spending money on
14      stuff that works for them.  And it doesn't matter
15      to them how many people die, it doesn't matter how
16      they die, as long as they make money.
17           Do you think they would have spent $330
18      million on that program if it wasn't working?
19      These are publicly held corporations, they have to
20      report to people.  They have to report when they
21      spend that kind of money.  You think they would
22      have done it if it wasn't working?  330 million.
23      And we're talking about money not 330 million in
24      today's dollars, we're just talking about the
25      numbers that they spent way back then and adding 3216
1      them up, that's how we get to 330.
2           The result, as you heard, was 20 million
3      Americans dead.  443,000 Americans die each year
4      from smoking-related diseases.  Now, we've never
5      had anything in the history of this country quite
6      like that.
7           And I don't know if R.J. Reynolds is going to
8      tell you that the United States of America
9      suddenly, in 1913, had a rash of people that didn't
10      want to live very long, and everybody decided to
11      run over the cliff and all smoke cigarettes and
12      kill themselves, because that's essentially what
13      amounts to their argument to you.
14           People all knew they were doing it to
15      themselves and they didn't care, they just didn't
16      care about living, they liked their cigarettes more
17      than their wives and their children and husbands
18      and everyone else.  It happened because of
19      addiction.  It happened because they couldn't go
20      without it.
21           You could fill this room, and you could ask
22      them to raise your hand if you lost someone you
23      loved to a smoking-related disease, and most of
24      that room would raise their hand.  And you could do
25      that in every room across the United States of 3217
1      America, and the same thing would happen.  That's
2      how many people they killed.
3           The jury instruction on this is long, but it's
4      important.  I want to show you something about
5      this.  The first one is that "Punitive damages are
6      warranted if you find by clear and convincing
7      evidence," and I tell you there hadn't been any
8      evidence otherwise, it's the only evidence.
9           "The conduct causing injury to Clarence Ellis
10      was so gross and flagrant as to show a reckless
11      disregard of human life or of the safety of persons
12      exposed to the effects of such conduct; or the
13      conduct showed an entire lack of care that Reynolds
14      must have been consciously indifferent to the
15      consequences; or the conduct showed such an entire
16      lack of care that R.J. Reynolds must have wantonly
17      or recklessly disregarded the safety and welfare of
18      the public; or the conduct showed such reckless
19      indifference to the rights of others as to be
20      equivalent to an intentional violation of those
21      rights."
22           The reason I emphasize "or" is any one of
23      those things will work, and they did all four.  You
24      wrap a blindfold around you and give you a dart,
25      you could throw it at that screen and no matter 3218
1      which one it hit, they did it.  The law recognizes
2      that any one of those things is reprehensible.  Any
3      one of them is reprehensible.
4           You've only got to do one of the four, you
5      don't have to do all of the four, just one subjects
6      somebody to punitive damages, whether it's a
7      corporation or a person like you and me.  They did
8      all four.
9           There is only one way to answer question 7,
10      and that's yes.
11           MR. SALES:  6.
12           MR. GUSTAFSON:  I'm sorry, question 6, I'm
13      sorry.
14           This isn't a situation where they didn't mean
15      it or it happened by accident and they didn't know
16      that their conduct was going to cause people to
17      die.  They knew.  They knew.  They lied.  They
18      conspired to make more money.  They didn't care
19      that people were going to die, they didn't care how
20      many.
21           I'm not going to describe that conduct to you.
22      You know what that is.  They want you to give them
23      a pass.  Those 20 million people who died were real
24      people, those ones who died.  They were real
25      people.  They had children.  They had spouses.  The 3219
1      law says you get to take that into account when you
2      decide how to answer this question.  You get to
3      take that into account, should they be punished.
4           Sonny Ellis was one of those people.
5           There is unrebutted, undisputed evidence in
6      this case that this conduct was exactly what you
7      know it to be.  I'm not even going to describe it.
8      The evidence is clear and convincing that the only
9      truly acceptable answer to that last question on
10      this verdict form is yes.
11           I hope I didn't miss anything.  I hope I
12      didn't go too long.  This is my last chance to say
13      anything to you in this trial.  I'm not going to do
14      the rebuttal argument.  I want to tell you thank
15      you.  I've never seen a jury ask so many questions.
16      I've never seen a jury so attentive.  I've never
17      seen a jury so engaged in the case.
18           So I don't get to say anything else when I
19      leave this podium.  Y'all need to do what's right.
20      Follow those instructions and do what's right.
21      Thank you.


15           MR. SALES:  Thank you, good afternoon,
16      everyone.
17           I want to say first of all in talking about
18      the time, I am known to be, as the Court has
19      reminded me a few times, loquacious, and talk a
20      little bit too much.  And it's likely that I will
21      use the entire hour that remains and probably
22      could, to the distress of all, stand at this
23      lectern and talk about Sonny Ellis and all of these
24      matters until it was far too late to do so.
25           I have a lot to cover, and I apologize, madam 3316
1      court reporter, because my words may come out a
2      little bit quickly.
3           I want to begin, if I could, please, by
4      thanking you, like everyone else, on behalf of
5      Ms. Ellis.  So let's get after it.
6           I want to start also by talking a little bit
7      about the things where Mr. Persons just left off
8      because one of the things he asked you, and we'll
9      be showing some of these, and when you look at them
10      and see the remarks stretched across "for exchange
11      purposes only," that's perfectly fine, we traded
12      things before we got started, but that's what they
13      showed you just a few moment ago.
14           And the question that you were asked was in
15      this slide "should RJR be punished?"  And I submit
16      to you that this defendant in this case, standing
17      toe to toe for decades with its co-conspirators,
18      what it wants is credit in this lawsuit about Sonny
19      Ellis, that's what he told you, for things that
20      have nothing to do with them.
21           Because cigarettes have carried warning
22      labels, as you heard from Robert Heimann, the
23      former chairman of American Tobacco, only because
24      Congress made them do it.  And they want credit for
25      that and to escape punishment for that. 3317
1           You've been told that they've reported their
2      ingredients.  And you'll recall from the testimony
3      of Dr. Cummings, that's since 1985, but only
4      because they were forced by law to do so.
5           And it was just suggested to you that the
6      information that is available today for cigarettes
7      since 1985, because Congress has made them post
8      these long lists of ingredients that are not
9      specific to cigarettes, you can get that today if
10      you go on their website, but is it like when you
11      open your carton of eggs where it tells you what
12      the cholesterol is?  It's not like that.
13           And yet they want credit to suggest to you
14      that they are just like the beer companies who even
15      now in our more enlightened era will tell you to
16      drink responsibly, will suggest to you to have a
17      designated driver.
18           Where was the television ad, where was the
19      print ad, where was the anything from this company
20      or any of its co-conspirators for a period of four
21      decades providing that same kind of information?
22      Because Mr. Persons says to you "We don't listen to
23      the manufacturer to know anything about our
24      product.  We listen to everybody else."
25           I submit to you that, yes, of course it's true 3318
1      that we care what our loved ones tell us, but
2      sometimes when people are addicted to a highly
3      addictive drug, the messages from others, and I'm
4      pointing to counsel?  No, I'm pointing to R.J.
5      Reynolds.  The message from others interferes.
6           So what do we know?  We know also that the
7      posting on their website that they want credit for
8      has only been in the last several years and after
9      Mr. Ellis died.  They want credit for that.
10      "Reynolds has disputed -- not disputed the dangers
11      or addictiveness of tobacco for more than a
12      decade."  We'll give them credit for 1999 because
13      that's when it happened, 15 years ago.  They want
14      credit for something that happened in this case
15      after Mr. Ellis died.
16           "Punitive damages are not necessary," this is
17      very important, "to prevent Reynolds from
18      concealing the dangers of tobacco."  I've written
19      "says who?"  Where is the evidence in this case, in
20      this trial, that they are doing anything today to
21      help contribute to those matters?  They brought
22      you, as Mr. Gustafson likes to say, nothing.
23           You heard a little bit about Premier and
24      Eclipse, these cigarettes that if you wander the
25      streets of Tallahassee, everywhere where cigarettes 3319
1      can be bought, for days, you would not be able to
2      find one.  They want credit for selling a cigarette
3      product that supposedly is healthier, that no one
4      can buy.
5           But this last one is very important for
6      another reason, because, as you've heard from the
7      Court, and you already have heard -- had these read
8      to you, this is the law, these are the things that
9      you are obliged to consider as the principle of law
10      when you decide your verdict whether or not they
11      deserve to be punished in this case.
12           And if you go back to what I just showed you,
13      they say don't punish us because you don't have to
14      do anything to prevent Reynolds from concealing the
15      dangers of tobacco?
16           Well, you know what, the instruction actually
17      says that your award, excuse me, verdict, if you
18      award punitive damages, if you find them to be
19      deserving by the -- by clear and convincing
20      evidence, that that is for punishment to Reynolds
21      for what they've already done and as a deterrent
22      not to Reynolds, but to others.
23           So the suggestion, just to get started on
24      this, that they don't need to be assessed punitive
25      damages because they don't need to be prevented 3320
1      from doing anything, that's not the law in this
2      case, that won't be part of the instructions.  More
3      on that in a few moments.
4           Finishing also, starting, rather, where
5      Mr. Persons sort of finished in this, the wind-up
6      to the punitive damage argument was, before he
7      started talking about them, you know, what we did
8      was stupid.
9           We would submit to you that there is nothing
10      stupid about the evidence in this case.  The
11      documents that you were shown in the plaintiff's
12      case reveal calculated, coldness, design, and every
13      effort possible not only to hide the addictive
14      effects of nicotine, which remained disputed in the
15      public eye at least until 1988, long after you just
16      heard it was too late for Mr. Ellis, not only for
17      those purposes, but also meanwhile, 20 million
18      souls perished from this product.
19           You're told it was stupid when they wrote in
20      their own documents that this is what we're all
21      about, we've got to protect our turf, we've got to
22      figure out a way to keep people from quitting and
23      get more people to start, hook young people and
24      keep them smoking.  And you're told that that was
25      stupid. 3321
1           Well, in fact, the evidence in this case, we
2      would submit to you, by clear and convincing
3      evidence, is that that was calculated and
4      purposeful.  And I wrote some adjectives down that
5      I thought, most respectfully, fit what you've seen
6      in this case.  Outrageous, depraved, and greedy.
7           This wasn't stupid, conduct which resulted in
8      more than 400,000 people dying every year.
9           This is a slide that was provided.  You know.
10      And one of the things about this quitting business,
11      those quitting statistics don't explain how many
12      people relapse.  And you've heard that this is a
13      relapsing brain disease, addiction to nicotine.
14           So they want to count everybody in there who
15      quits, quits for a while, stays off cigarettes, the
16      way it's reported, goes back to smoking cigarettes,
17      quits for a while, goes back to smoking cigarettes,
18      quits for a while.
19           And some of those same quitters actually are
20      in those same 20 million people who died.  And they
21      want credit for the people even though they did
22      nothing for a period of 50 years to help people
23      quit smoking, they want credit for that.
24           And, in fact, I would submit to you that that
25      would not fill Doak that many times, but even if it 3322
1      did, you have, by clear and convincing evidence,
2      heard in this case, they brought you nothing, the
3      fact that 20 million people have perished as a
4      result of what they've done.  That would fill the
5      same stadium 243 times.
6           Now, before Mr. Persons started talking about
7      those matters, he was talking to you about the
8      issue of the fault allocations.
9           And one of the things you've heard, may not
10      remember it, you'll hear it again or you'll be able
11      to read it certainly with the jury instructions
12      that you have, is that the Court, after your
13      verdict, if there is a verdict for the plaintiff,
14      will look at the percentages of fault and make
15      adjustments in the amount of the recovery that the
16      plaintiff makes in accordance with the law that's
17      applicable to each claim.
18           We're not allowed to discuss that with you
19      right now, but that's part of your instruction.
20           THE COURT:  Sidebar.
21           MR. PERSONS:  Thank you.
22           THE COURT:  You are not allowed to discuss it.
23      You shouldn't be discussing it.
24           MR. SALES:  It's in the instruction, Your
25      Honor. 3323
1           THE COURT:  Let's go sidebar.
2           (The following is at the bench.)
3           MR. SALES:  That was my intent.  Yeah, right
4      here, Judge.
5           THE COURT:  Just a second.
6           That doesn't say "adjust" anywhere.
7           MR. PERSONS:  No.
8           MR. SALES:  Is that the word I used?
9           THE COURT:  Yes.  You said "I will adjust."
10      I'm going to instruct the jury not to consider
11      that.
12           MR. SALES:  And I'll correct it afterwards,
13      enter a judgment.
14           THE COURT:  That's what we spent an hour on
15      last night making sure we didn't convey.
16           MR. SALES:  I'm going to put that right up on
17      the board so everybody can see it, Judge.
18           THE COURT:  Okay.
19           (In open court.)
20           MR. SALES:  I'm going to put the --
21           THE COURT:  Wait, wait.
22           MR. SALES:  I'm going to put the exact
23      language up there.
24           THE COURT:  Hold on a second.
25           MR. SALES:  Sorry. 3324
1           THE COURT:  So the objection is sustained.
2      You are instructed to disregard that last remark
3      about what I'm going to do after the trial.  I'm
4      going to read you what the law is.
5           "In determining the total amount of damages,
6      you should not make any reduction because of the
7      comparative fault of Clarence C. Ellis.  The Court
8      will enter a judgment based on your verdict and the
9      law applicable to each claim."  Period.  That's it.
10      Disregard, do not consider any other comment other
11      than that on that topic.
12           You may proceed.
13           MR. SALES:  Thank you, Your Honor.  And for
14      the record, that instruction that the Court just
15      read is displayed in front of you now and I want to
16      repeat that.  "The Court will enter a judgment
17      based upon your verdict and the law applicable to
18      each claim."  And that relates to the issue of the
19      comparative fault allocations that are on the
20      verdict form.
21           So counsel discussed with you all, and they
22      had this sort of metered thing going up and down.
23      And we would just indicate to you that when those
24      matters are considered, when the comparative fault
25      allocation is made by you in assigning percentages, 3325
1      that there are other matters --
2           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.  May
3      we --
4           THE COURT:  Let's go sidebar.
5           (The following is at the bench.)
6           THE COURT:  You are very, very close to
7      getting a mistrial.
8           MR. PERSONS:  Yes.
9           MR. SALES:  What is the issue, Judge?
10           MR. PERSONS:  The grounds for the objection is
11      that those things have to be tied to a legal cause
12      of the death of Mr. Ellis.  And what I'm hearing is
13      an argument on punitive damages.  It's as though
14      you are assuming that they've checked yes on
15      entitlement, and you are going into a punitive
16      damages counterpart.
17           THE COURT:  Here is what I took, that we were
18      on the verge of talking about adjusting anything.
19      We are not going to talk about adjusting damages.
20      So I'm going to -- I'm going to give you-all
21      latitude in arguing.  I'm going to overrule
22      Mr. Persons' at this time on that point.
23           Just be very, very careful about any
24      indication that anything is going to be adjusted.
25      We don't know what I'm going to do. 3326
1           MR. SALES:  May I just make a brief record?  I
2      was referring to counsel's slide 104, which is the
3      comparative fault allegations, I was not discussing
4      any adjustment of a judgment.
5           THE COURT:  I know, but I was concerned that's
6      where we were headed.
7           MR. SALES:  No, Your Honor.
8           THE COURT:  Okay.
9           MR. SALES:  Your Honor, may I put this back up
10      and continue this comparative fault.
11           THE COURT:  Yes, you may.
12           MR. SALES:  Thank you.
13           (In open court.)
14           THE COURT:  All right, the objection is
15      overruled.  You may proceed under the guidelines
16      that I indicated.
17           MR. SALES:  Yes, Your Honor.  Thank you.
18           Members of the jury, when you go to consider
19      the issue of comparative fault, my suggestion to
20      you is that there are more things to consider than
21      that were on the slide that was shown to you by
22      counsel.
23           Among the things to consider are the things
24      that you heard about in this case, the way in which
25      the design of cigarettes affects smoking behavior, 3327
1      the way in which cigarettes are engineered, and
2      importantly, from the perspective of the plaintiff,
3      the motivations behind the defendant's conduct and
4      that of their co-conspirators with respect to
5      addicting smokers and causing their death.
6           You've been told that if you find for the
7      plaintiff on the issue of class membership, that
8      you will be bound by the Engle findings.  I think
9      everyone recalls that.  One of those findings, if
10      you recall from the instructions, are that, let me
11      make sure I get it right, "If you find for the
12      plaintiff on the issue of class membership that
13      cigarettes produced by R.J. Reynolds were defective
14      and unreasonably dangerous."
15           And counsel indicated that there was nothing
16      R.J. Reynolds could have done that would have
17      prevented Mr. Ellis's death.  That's what was
18      argued to you.
19           Well, we would submit to you that there are
20      choices in this case on the part of the plaintiff,
21      which has been argued extensively by Mr. Persons,
22      but there were also choices on the part of the
23      manufacturer.  You've heard evidence in this case
24      that going back very early in the 20th century that
25      all of the major manufacturers of tobacco products 3328
1      had the ability to remove nicotine.  And you've
2      also heard evidence that they didn't do it because
3      it would have impaired their ability to sell
4      tobacco products.
5           But clearly the evidence in this case is that
6      it was within the power of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
7      Company to make cigarettes that are not defective
8      and unreasonably dangerous.  And, in fact,
9      Mr. Persons concluded his argument by suggesting to
10      you that R.J. Reynolds has done just that with its
11      products Premier and Eclipse.
12           The argument of the defense counsel as I was
13      listening to it occurred to me to sort of be
14      divided into four parts.  There was a part of it
15      that talked about Mr. Ellis's addiction, but before
16      that, the first part, counsel indicated that
17      everybody knew that cigarettes were addictive all
18      this time, despite what the evidence has shown with
19      respect to what they and their co-conspirators
20      concealed from the public.
21           So there were two parts to this.  There was a
22      part that suggested that Mr. Ellis knew all along,
23      but even if he knew, he wasn't addicted.  And there
24      was a part of it that suggested, argued directly,
25      in fact, that Mr. Ellis did not have lung cancer, 3329
1      primary lung cancer, bronchogenic cancer, whatever
2      we are going to call it because we know that those
3      things are all the same as Dr. Okun explained to us
4      yesterday.
5           So there were two parts to that as well.  One,
6      there is no proof that cancer was caused in this
7      case, but even if there was, it was all Mr. Ellis's
8      fault because he knew that that could happen all
9      along.
10           I'm going to talk in a few minutes about how
11      it was that the defendants were able to do what
12      they did not only in relation to the public and all
13      those people who suffered as a result of what the
14      defendant and its co-conspirators did, but I want
15      to suggest to you for a moment that we go right
16      back to the beginning of counsel's argument and
17      talk about what he said the case was about, which
18      was Mr. Ellis and Lucky Strike cigarettes.
19           Can you switch over?
20           The picture with the Lucky Strike and
21      Mr. Ellis.  Sorry.
22           There may be some others in evidence, I'm not
23      quite sure about that, that actually show Mr. Ellis
24      with his Lucky Strike cigarettes, but this one
25      clearly does.  And you'll recall that there was 3330
1      some testimony in the case, I think it was from
2      Dr. Jaffe, about this period of time and assessment
3      of even then whether Mr. Ellis was addicted to
4      nicotine.  So here is a picture of Mr. Ellis at the
5      end of his life suffering from lung cancer.  That's
6      the plaintiff's position, certainly.
7           And you can take that down.
8           So from the notes that I took, in thinking
9      about that photograph, this is what I wrote with
10      respect to the defense argument in the case if one
11      were, during Mr. Ellis's life, trying to explain
12      the defense position, this is what might be
13      explained to Mr. Ellis.
14           If you did have cancer in your lung, R.J.
15      Reynolds is not going to say that it started there,
16      so it wasn't lung cancer.  If it was lung cancer,
17      it was caused by smoking.  But if it was caused by
18      smoking, it wasn't because you, Mr. Ellis, were
19      addicted to nicotine.
20           But if you were addicted to nicotine, it's
21      still all your fault because you chose to smoke,
22      you failed to quit using our products, exactly the
23      way we wanted you to, lighting them, smoking them,
24      and inhaling the smoke.
25           And there was very little said about the 3331
1      things that R.J. Reynolds actually did in this case
2      in closing by the defense, but the comments might
3      continue that it's true that we lied, but you
4      should have known better, and you should have not
5      believed anything that was put out by us or any of
6      the tobacco companies, Tobacco Institute.
7           But even if you did believe those things, even
8      if you were putting them on the refrigerator
9      because you were really sincerely, which was
10      consistent with your character, trying to
11      demonstrate your belief to your friends and family
12      who were trying to help you, you should have tried
13      harder to quit.
14           But even if you did try and quit, and the
15      evidence in this case is that there were at least
16      10 to 15 quit attempts, and we believe that,
17      counsel just said, he believes, unlike Dr. Jaffe,
18      that those quit attempts actually took place, that
19      Mr. Ellis -- it wouldn't have mattered because you
20      smoked, smoked, smoked our cigarettes until you
21      were dead.
22           And I would submit to you that that's actually
23      what the defense case is here.  And one of the ways
24      it's demonstrated in a trial with the development
25      of all the technology, it's of great benefit, one 3332
1      of the things the Court instructed you on before we
2      started with closing arguments, was a reminder that
3      what the lawyers say is not evidence.
4           So when the lawyers, and they do it together,
5      we all do it, get together with the witnesses, put
6      together these slides, it's the lawyers'
7      perspective as to what the case has been all about.
8           And I mention that to you because we had a
9      witness in the case who --
10           Will you switch back, please?
11           -- who said something, it was Dr. Jaffe, and
12      you may remember that he was talking about in
13      redirect from Mr. Kreiner, as we went over with him
14      quite a bit about some of the things that were
15      different from the long summaries of the testimony
16      that he gave.  He talked about the part that he
17      wanted to talk about, and he did so extensively.
18           And then we showed some of the things that
19      didn't fit with what he was saying.  And when Mr.
20      Kreiner asked him some questions about that on
21      redirect, what he told you, members of the jury, is
22      that "My job is to resolve the discrepancies, and
23      that's what I did."
24           And I would submit to you, members of the
25      jury, that the instructions that you're going to 3333
1      get are actually a little bit different.  As His
2      Honor has told you, I've got this underlined, that
3      was part of what you heard already "I am now," the
4      Court speaking, "going to tell you about the rules
5      of law that you must use in reaching your verdict."
6      One of them is what the lawyers say is not
7      evidence.
8           But also, there wasn't any instruction in
9      there to suggest to you that the experts tell you
10      the way that it is.  In fact, contrary to what
11      Dr. Jaffe says, some of those things are your
12      decision.  "You decide the issues that are
13      submitted for your determination."
14           And then the Court told you what the evidence
15      in the case is.  And then the Court told you one of
16      the ways in which you do that.  You measure
17      people's believability.  Counsel mentioned some of
18      those things.  The demeanor.  The frankness.  The
19      intelligence.  Interests they may have in the
20      outcome.  The means and opportunity the witness had
21      to know the facts about which the witness
22      testified.  The ability of the witness to remember.
23      And the reasonableness of what they have to say in
24      light of your own -- I think it says common sense
25      and experience. 3334
1           And then below that, it says for experts, you
2      can accept or reject that.  And that's up to you.
3           So when you're in a case where you have two
4      types of testimony, one type of testimony is sworn
5      testimony from folks who were there, and one type
6      of testimony is testimony from people who are
7      summarizing all of that, counsel just mentioned
8      that, we would suggest to you that if it's a
9      question about evaluating all of the evidence, the
10      evidence that's submitted for your consideration,
11      that you should rely on your recollection best of
12      what the witnesses said and not what witnesses who
13      came into court said that they said.
14           One more point about that.  And Your Honor,
15      respectfully, that's also an instruction that was
16      given earlier in the case, because some of the
17      testimony that you heard was in the form of
18      depositions.
19           And as the Court indicated at that time, "The
20      deposition testimony is sworn testimony of a
21      witness that's given before trial, and that's going
22      to be read to you.
23           And you should consider and weigh this
24      testimony -- deposition testimony as you would any
25      other evidence in the case.  It's as if that person 3335
1      is actually here, but you're going to hear the
2      sworn testimony read to you by the parties."
3           And so as you've heard, in advance of trial,
4      one of the things that we all do is get together
5      and lawyers, sometimes they're subpoenaed,
6      sometimes they show up, and sworn statements,
7      depositions, you've seen these transcripts, the
8      lawyers use to help the witnesses or sometimes
9      challenge them, that's the record in the case.
10           And when those depositions have been read to
11      you, they are to be considered by you as though the
12      witnesses had come live.
13           Now, a couple more things about Dr. Jaffe,
14      because as you remember, we were sort of, I guess,
15      criticized or mocked for going through all the
16      things that people who knew Mr. Ellis, that they
17      swore to before trial, had said before trial and
18      revealing those instances in which they didn't fit
19      with what Dr. Jaffe had to say.
20           And his answer to that was, as you just heard
21      on redirect, "I resolved the discrepancies."  No,
22      sir.  Members of the jury, that's up to you.
23           So what do you do when you get some of these
24      things that don't fit in the case?  Because I want
25      to stay, if I can, and pick just a little bit more 3336
1      on Dr. Jaffe.  Mr. Persons told you about how he
2      was the -- you know, the only person with substance
3      abuse training, and he's the witness that you ought
4      to rely upon most when you get to that very first
5      and essential question in the case about addiction,
6      was Mr. Ellis addicted, we're going to talk a
7      little bit more about that.
8           And he kind of cast aspersions on the
9      Fagerstrom test, and you've just heard about it
10      again in closing argument by counsel for R.J.
11      Reynolds.
12           Well, what do we know about that?  It wasn't
13      discussed during the trial, but Mr. Gustafson
14      mentioned this to you.
15           I don't remember the exhibit number, it's
16      ANS-00 --
17           MR. GUSTAFSON:  1324-A.
18           MR. SALES:  -- 1324.  And this is in evidence.
19      That's one of those documents that the Court
20      instructed you when you go back to deliberate
21      you're going to get a chance to look at.
22      Mr. Gustafson mentioned it briefly, but since
23      counsel mentioned the Fagerstrom test, I would like
24      to talk about it a little bit more.
25           And what it is, is a document that describes a 3337
1      program to figure out if another product of R.J.
2      Reynolds, which is called Snus, that's an oral
3      tobacco, a pouch you put under your tongue, is
4      helpful in clinical trials and can they use it
5      possibly as a product as a means to move people
6      from oral tobacco -- excuse me, from smoking to
7      oral tobaccos.
8           And so one of the things that they did is they
9      had 600 people in this study.  And the issue in the
10      case for them was whether or not there was nicotine
11      dependence.  And you know from Dr. Jaffe and all
12      the other witnesses -- well, for everybody prior to
13      nine months ago, dependence and addiction meant the
14      same thing.  For Dr. Jaffe and I guess some
15      psychologists now, they're two different things.
16           But anyway, for the purposes of this study,
17      and you had to be male or female, 21 to 65, and the
18      protocol in the study, it wasn't to use the DSM-IV,
19      which would have existed five years ago, still
20      exists, it was to use the FTND cigarette.  And if
21      you look further in the document, you figure out
22      what that means, because they tell you.
23           In order to assess dependence, they measure it
24      for their own study internally, not with one of
25      these, that one or this one, they use it, the same 3338
1      one, as one of the ones this guy talked about.
2           Oh, and by the way, and just going back to
3      what we were talking about a few minutes ago, we're
4      talking about, you know, use your own memory of
5      what the testimony is and that the slides are not
6      actually the evidence?  You see how it looks like
7      this comes from this transcript?
8           The question's in there, "Now he never -- your
9      husband, Mr. Brown, just so I'm clear, Mr. Brown
10      never said anything to you about any specific
11      cigarette."
12           This is from -- and I'm not fussing with
13      counsel over it, but this particular transcript
14      that you were shown obviously has nothing to do
15      with the testimony that was described to you.  And
16      that's one of those instances where you-all need to
17      rely on your recollection about whether or not the
18      witnesses have said what's represented in the
19      closing arguments of the lawyers.
20           But anyway, getting back to this thing, what
21      do we know?  We talk about the Fagerstrom score and
22      the impacts of it.  And what they did was they used
23      the same questions that you saw Dr. Cummings go
24      over and Mr. Gustafson mentioned and Mr. Persons
25      mentioned. 3339
1           And that's the test that R.J. Reynolds, they
2      don't invite Dr. Jaffe, they don't invite
3      psychologists or psychiatrists who are using these
4      things, they do what people, real scientists do in
5      the real world when they want to find out if
6      tobacco products are addictive and how people get
7      off of them, that's what they use.
8           So that's one of those instances in which,
9      yeah, it's true that there is a discrepancy in the
10      evidence, and you-all have to make a decision.
11      Does it matter what R.J. Reynolds says and does
12      outside the context of the courtroom?  And we
13      submit that it does.  We submit that it's a
14      verification of the reliability of this.
15           And these measures are not the touchy, feely
16      things that Dr. Jaffe talked about.  These are
17      facts.  And you know what, because Mr. Ellis isn't
18      with us, we can't even ask him about two of these
19      questions.
20           These are objective facts, and what did they
21      bring you, as Mr. Gustafson would say?  They
22      brought you nothing to challenge any of these
23      things.  It doesn't involve those things that they
24      say are in dispute.
25           And so what the folks participating in R.J. 3340
1      Reynolds' studies would hear when they're being
2      assessed to see if they're a good candidate to go
3      to another moneymaking product for R.J. Reynolds,
4      they would say if they had an 8 like Sonny Ellis,
5      "Your level of dependence is high.  You aren't in
6      control of your smoking, it is in control of you.
7      When you make the decision to quit, you may want to
8      talk with your doctor about nicotine replacement
9      therapy or other medications."
10           And that's one of those discrepancies in the
11      evidence, that's one of those disputed issues of
12      fact which we suggest that you should resolve in
13      favor of the plaintiff, because that's a very
14      reliable test that you-all don't need help with to
15      do that.
16           Talk a little bit about these, though.  And
17      certainly, if I contributed to making this
18      confusing, I apologize to everyone, but I think
19      just to review this very briefly, this DSM-IV, they
20      used to use that, and it was a measure for nicotine
21      dependence, and it was a measure of nicotine
22      dependence that psychologists and psychiatrists,
23      according to Dr. Jaffe, used and he used in
24      lawsuits until nine months ago.  It's a synonym for
25      addiction. 3341
1           This (indicating) is a measure of what he
2      calls, the book calls tobacco use disorder.  It's
3      not a measure of addiction or dependence.  And do
4      you recall his testimony, which was "I know it says
5      you need two, but you really need six to work up to
6      addiction, because without that, it's not severe."
7           And one of the explanations for that was, you
8      know, addiction changes.  Science changes.  And I
9      want to be up to date and keep up with things.  And
10      certainly that's true.
11           But what you know from Mr. Gustafson's
12      presentation is that the thing, contrary to what
13      Dr. Jaffe tells us that's changed the most is what
14      we know about what they do, and that's why the
15      content of public health messages today, like that
16      2010 booklet that tells you that they used design
17      features, they may be using those to hijack the
18      brains and bodies of smokers, that's what's
19      changed.  Human bodies haven't changed.  Brains
20      haven't changed.
21           And in the last nine months, I would submit to
22      you that there isn't anything different about
23      whether or not someone is or is not addicted to
24      nicotine.  And certainly just five years ago,
25      Reynolds thinks Fagerstrom is the way to go. 3342
1           But I do want to spend just a minute talking
2      to you about that, because one of the interesting
3      things about this is that, you know, if you went
4      with the old book, and this is interesting, you
5      only needed three to be addicted or dependent.
6           Now, they have this little thing they do with
7      the "as manifested by."  Remember what Dr. Jaffe
8      told you, you know, we can all read some of these
9      things.  And I would submit to you that some of
10      these things don't require a PhD in psychology.
11           MR. PERSONS:  Your Honor, may we approach?
12           THE COURT:  Okay.
13           (The following is at the bench.)
14           MR. GUEST:  Your Honor, the objection is
15      DSM-IV is not in evidence and he's showing a
16      document that's not in evidence.
17           THE COURT:  I actually thought about that, but
18      I believe that page was displayed to the jury, I
19      recall --
20           MR. PERSONS:  I couldn't recall.
21           THE COURT:  I recall seeing it.  So I'm going
22      to overrule.  It's not in evidence, but I do recall
23      seeing that page displayed --
24           MR. SALES:  Right.
25           THE COURT:  -- to the jury when 3343
1      cross-examining Dr. Jaffe.
2           MR. SALES:  Right.  I used it.
3           MR. GUSTAFSON:  I have a question.  Do we get
4      charged for the sidebars on our time?
5           THE COURT:  I charged him on his time, yeah.
6           MR. GUSTAFSON:  I wasn't sure what the Court
7      was doing, that's all I was asking.  He has got
8      about 20 minutes left, 30 minutes.
9           THE COURT:  72 minutes and it started I think
10      at 3:31 so that's 60 minutes so you have 12 past
11      that.
12           MR. SALES:  20, 25, like that?
13           THE COURT:  Yeah.  Now, again, it's up to
14      y'all whether you want to use it.
15           MR. SALES:  I need to keep zipping.  I'm ready
16      to go.
17           THE COURT:  This is y'all.  I'm not going to
18      require you to use it, but if you want to use it,
19      you've got it.  Okay?
20           (In open court.)
21           MR. SALES:  All right.  And this would have
22      been equivalent with the diagnosis of addiction.
23      And this language "as manifested by."
24           Now, they tell you that you don't even get to
25      these criteria unless someone already is getting 3344
1      fired or breaking up with their wife or not being
2      able to go to every event or something like that.
3           But actually, those are the things that define
4      whether or not there is a clinically-significant
5      impairment.  I would submit to you that as
6      manifested by three or more of the following
7      occurring within a 12-month period is if any --
8      three or more of those are there, that means you're
9      dependent.  That means you're addicted.
10           And you could go over those, because 1(b) he
11      gave the plaintiff, tolerance, and there is a
12      suggestion, Mr. Ellis never had withdrawal.  I
13      would submit to you you know that that's not so
14      because when he got up in the morning, he chain
15      smoked.  That was undisputed evidence.
16           He needed to fill his brain, as Mr. Gustafson
17      explained.  Often taken in larger amounts or over a
18      longer period of time than was intended.
19      Dr. Jaffe's thing on that is he never reported it
20      so we don't know.  I submit to use your common
21      sense on that.
22           Does anybody who does this to themselves,
23      because they're addicted and because they believe
24      the lies of this defendant and its co-conspirators
25      start out smoking two to three packs a day?  Nobody 3345
1      does.
2           A great deal of time chain smoking.  He says
3      that ain't chain smoking because he didn't do it
4      all day.  Mr. Gustafson has disputed and explained
5      that.
6           And then 6, it's important things like social,
7      occupational, rec, that are given up or reduced.
8      So you know from the portion of Tammy Ellis's
9      deposition that was read to Dr. Jaffe yesterday,
10      confronted him with it that it wasn't a one-time
11      thing, it was every time they went out he had those
12      problems.
13           So those are just the ones that are
14      self-evident in this record, one, two, three, four,
15      five.  Even if you use this psychologist's text or
16      book, that's what you get.  But you know what,
17      because they say that this is a mental disorder and
18      this is another thing that I asked Dr. Jaffe about
19      nicotine dependence used to be addiction --
20           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
21           MR. SALES:  That was displayed to the jury,
22      Your Honor.
23           THE COURT:  Was this page displayed --
24           MR. SALES:  This very page was and questions
25      were asked of Dr. Jaffe on it. 3346
1           THE COURT:  Hold on.  Is that the basis of the
2      objection?
3           MR. PERSONS:  Yes, Your Honor.
4           THE COURT:  I'm going to take counsel at his
5      word that it was displayed to the jury, and it will
6      be up to the jury to make a determination as to
7      whether they recall actually seeing this.
8           MR. PERSONS:  All right, sir.
9           THE COURT:  Okay.
10           MR. SALES:  Because they say that our case is
11      subjective.  Well, certain things in the DSM, even
12      if you get past the touchy, feely part of it,
13      they're not subjective, they're objective just
14      like -- remember that stuff about facts and
15      opinions?  Facts, physical exams, and doctors did
16      that in this case.
17           Nobody is saying that he didn't have tobacco
18      odor.  He and his family complained about it.
19      There is evidence of cough.  They say it's not
20      enough.  You rely on your memory about that.
21      Evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
22           Well, he had it.  It appears that he didn't
23      know that he had it, but he had it.  And it's
24      documented, no dispute about it.  And it was caused
25      by smoking.  Tobacco stains on finger, that's rare, 3347
1      but he had that too.
2           So we submit to you no matter what measure
3      that you use, plaintiff has proved addiction.
4           Let's talk a little bit about lung cancer.
5      Because their position in this case is it's not
6      proven, and that this entire medical community, I
7      don't know how many physicians it is, but it's lots
8      of them, that every single one of them who saw this
9      guy, Mr. Ellis, got it wrong, that their language
10      is imprecise --
11           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor, not
12      supported by the evidence.
13           MR. SALES:  That's what Dr. Jaffe said and
14      Dr. Okun said, they were wrong.
15           THE COURT:  Dr. Okun said that Dr. Bilek was
16      correct.
17           MR. SALES:  Oh.
18           THE COURT:  So I think that is not totally
19      accurate.
20           MR. SALES:  Okay.  We're going to clear that
21      up right now.
22           It's true Dr. Okun said Dr. Bilek was wrong
23      some of the time and right some of the time.  More
24      on that in a moment.
25           But I would like to urge you, and, you know, 3348
1      I'm famous for being a poor artist, and I apologize
2      to Ms. Ellis for suggesting that that's a
3      representation of her husband.  Let's think about
4      this a little bit.  Because what we know in this
5      case and you are urged in the jury instructions to
6      use your common sense about whether or not this man
7      had lung cancer.
8           And even Dr. Okun admits that a primary lesion
9      found in the lung is atypical for metastasis, that
10      means coming from somewhere else, that would be
11      unusual, all right?  And he also told us that there
12      was cancer in the head, skull, brain, orbit, also
13      the scalp, he also told us that it was in the
14      thoracic spine in many places, it was in the
15      shoulder, and it was in the lung.
16           He told us that it can't go from the head to
17      the lung.  It can't go from the T spine to the
18      lung.  It can't go from the shoulder to the lung,
19      but it can go from the lung to the shoulder, the
20      lung to the T spine and from the lung to the --
21           THE COURT:  You're talking so fast I'm not
22      sure the court reporter is getting this down.  I'm
23      trying to follow the real time.
24           Are you doing okay?
25           THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes, sir. 3349
1           THE COURT:  Okay.
2           MR. SALES:  And we heard from Dr. McCoy, he
3      said I did everything.  I did the blood work, I
4      ordered the scans, this man's entire body, not
5      including his arms and legs, I guess, the skin.
6      And we know all those places that Dr. Okun said the
7      cancer could have come from, the genitals, the
8      bladder, the other places in the abdomen, the
9      stomach, the colon, all of those were scanned.  And
10      so their answer to that is, well, you know, cancer
11      can be so small when it starts that you might have
12      missed it.
13           And by the way, and this is a trick, I would
14      submit to you, we didn't have the technology that
15      we now have to have provided us with the
16      information that we need to make this diagnosis.
17      So we would submit to you that there is no question
18      about it.
19           And do you remember that Dr. Bilek was asked,
20      you know, what is the last record that Dr. --
21      excuse me, Dr. Okun was asked what's the last
22      record that has information from Dr. Bilek?  And
23      when you go back and look at the medical records,
24      see if you can't identify the signatures, see if
25      you can't identify the handwriting. 3350
1           And what does he call it as late as February
2      of 1993, CA lung.  And you know from the
3      examination that we did of Dr. Okun what that
4      means.
5           More evidence.  Dr. Bilek ordered on January
6      29th, 1993, a test.  He ordered a test that was a
7      CT scan of the brain and the orbits.  And it was
8      reviewed by the radiologist, Dr. Ostrov.
9           So Dr. Ostrov gets an order from Dr. Bilek to
10      clear all this up about the stuff that was in the
11      middle when he was putting a question mark by
12      things, because the last two records that we have
13      from this man, what do they tell us?  He orders the
14      test from Dr. Ostrov who reviews it and tells us
15      "History of cancer of the lung with a known mass in
16      the region of the left orbit."
17           And if this weren't enough, Dr. Bilek, why did
18      he say that?  Because earlier, he knew this, he
19      knew that it was a primary -- excuse me,
20      biopsy-proven bronchogenic carcinoma of the left
21      lung.  The greater weight of the evidence on that
22      matter should be clear.
23           I want to talk a little bit about whether or
24      not these matters made a difference.  And when I
25      discuss those things with you, I want you to 3351
1      remember something, which is that these matters
2      weren't matters of stupidity for the defense, which
3      was the suggestion and final argument by
4      Mr. Persons.
5           These weren't the matters of stupidity.  These
6      were matters of design, not only the product and
7      hijacking the brains and bodies of smokers, but
8      also in the way in which they communicated with the
9      public.
10           One of the things that's in evidence, because
11      it reflects something from the time, what people
12      back then believed, what smokers believed and
13      nonsmokers believed, we reviewed it extensively, is
14      chapter 3 of the 1981 FTC report, there is chapter
15      2 and there is chapter 3, this is from chapter 2,
16      which relates to advertising.
17           Chapter 3 relates to public attitudes and
18      knowledge and information about smoking and the
19      health risks of smoking.  And what it tells you is
20      that a majority of smokers did not know that
21      cigarettes were addictive.  More on that in a
22      moment.
23           And what it also tells you about advertising
24      is that they were outspending the public health
25      community by I guess about more than 300 to 1, or 3352
1      at least the government, in trying to get out some
2      of these messages that you've seen.
3           Well, how did they do it?
4           You know, for every one of those articles, and
5      they're all in evidence, you can take a look at
6      them from the Moultrie Observer, there are
7      highlighted quotes here, but Mr. Gustafson showed
8      some of them to you previously when he put
9      Dr. Burns on, it was over and over and over again
10      and it was all with an eye toward this.
11           Remember who this was from?  This was from
12      George Weissman to the head of -- Mr. Cullman.
13      He's that same guy who went on Meet the Press or
14      one of those Sunday shows, I think it was Meet the
15      Press, and said it's not been proven, and by the
16      way, people like smaller babies, suggesting that
17      even the most vulnerable of the population are not
18      harmed by cigarette smoke, don't worry about it,
19      everybody?
20           Why were they doing those things?  They were
21      doing it because smokers needed to believe.  It's
22      never been the position of the plaintiff in this
23      case that people didn't know that cigarettes could
24      cause disease.
25           If you remember back to the forwarding memo 3353
1      back in 1953, the industry wasn't trying to
2      persuade people that cigarettes didn't cause
3      disease, they were just trying to give them enough
4      doubt to pick up the next cigarette.
5           And, in fact, they told you things like,
6      through their own words, that "What is truth to one
7      is false to another."  They told you, and this is
8      in evidence, that "Doubt was their real product."
9      They told you, and these are all in evidence, that
10      their position was that they could be subject to a
11      finding that they were making false statements.
12           You saw documents relating to the lawyers.
13      You heard about how the lawyers controlled the
14      messages.  You heard about how the lawyers were
15      responsible for the 6,000 articles.  They brought
16      you one.  And if you go to the end of it, 1963, it
17      confirms the plaintiff's case that smokers are true
18      addicts.  Out of 6,000 pieces of science, one
19      apparently escaped the review and the attention of
20      the lawyers sufficient that it could be brought to
21      you in this case to suggest that they were never
22      really lying about it.
23           And, you know, we showed you documents that
24      reflected that they predicted in monetary terms how
25      much money they would have to spend to counter the 3354
1      public health messages about the risks of smoking.
2      And how were they doing, how did they do it?
3           You know, in this day and time it seems almost
4      quaint and difficult to believe that someone could
5      pull this off.  And yet here we have a case, and we
6      know, because if counsel's position and R.J.
7      Reynolds' position about this case is true, all of
8      these people who continued to smoke were just
9      smoke, smoke, smoking themselves to death.
10           So in this day and age, like counsel himself
11      said, with the internet and everything else, it
12      seems a little bit difficult to believe, okay?
13      They put out all this scientific work.  This was
14      the real product of CTR and all of those projects.
15           They reported that there was progress, that
16      the statistics didn't prove it, that papers
17      challenged lung cancer, that your constitution was
18      the issue, that the mobile home -- risk among
19      mobile people and white collar workers was higher.
20      They had books that they published.
21           They did animal studies.  They talk -- they
22      told people it was viruses.  They told people it
23      was whether or not you were extroverted or
24      introverted.  They told people it had to do with
25      whether you were married, if that isn't ironic in 3355
1      this case.
2           As we told you in opening statement these are
3      all in evidence.  They told people it had something
4      to do with whether people were bald or not.  And
5      this one.
6           You know, it may seem incredible to believe,
7      but in 19 -- in the 1960s, they were telling people
8      that it was not only a issue of personality but
9      these things always were coming from Britain, you
10      can look in there, some foreign country, you know
11      what, "carcinogens don't cause lung cancer."
12           Now, it may seem, you know, somewhat
13      preposterous to suggest to you that these things
14      matter.  That here we have an undisputed record
15      that Sonny Ellis was posting things on his
16      refrigerator into the 1990s and the parties in this
17      case to try to pull together these things and say,
18      well, he must have seen this, he must have seen
19      that, but what do we know?
20           And counsel himself just reminded you this was
21      a Florida newspaperman.  And remember something he
22      said about the fold of the paper?  Well, I guess
23      it's true that this is below the fold, but front
24      page news in 1979, on the cover of a Florida paper,
25      it's true it was in Gainesville, please don't hold 3356
1      that against the plaintiff, Horace Kornegay, former
2      congressman, he's front page news saying the
3      Surgeon General is all wet.  Those kinds of
4      stories, these are in evidence, you can take a look
5      at them, continued well into the 1970s, the 1980s.
6           And by the way, it wasn't just company say-so.
7      Mr. Ellis wasn't the only person, this is in
8      evidence as well, who was reading about, thinking
9      about these things, and believing them.  This is
10      from the Orlando Sentinel, in 1985.  You'll be able
11      to see that when you have it.  It's an editorial on
12      the Op Ed page.
13           And this writer tells his readers, among other
14      things, "The claim that cigarette smoking causes
15      lung cancer is a good example.  It may or may not,
16      but no scientific study has yet established a
17      causal relationship.  The only thing researchers
18      have done is establish a correlation, association,
19      based on epidemiological studies, which are not
20      scientific experiments, but merely sociological
21      studies."
22           So when you get to that, and when you're told
23      in a case where you would have to be a fool, Sonny
24      Ellis would have had to have been a fool to believe
25      an industry that could outspend the government 365 3357
1      to 1 in trying to get its message and its word out
2      through the most devious of means, because that's
3      the defense in this case.
4           And, you know, we haven't talked much about it
5      in rebuttal but I want to spend a little bit
6      talking about addiction, because what you'll see
7      when you look at the instructions in the case, when
8      you get a chance to look at them again, the verdict
9      form too, there are two parts to this case.  One
10      part is about the risks, the health risks of
11      smoking, and the other part is the part about the
12      addictiveness of nicotine.
13           And it wasn't just that the industry was
14      trying to create a controversy about whether or not
15      cigarettes caused disease just like this editorial
16      writer said even into the 1980s when according to
17      counsel it was already too late for Mr. Ellis, they
18      absolutely did not want people to believe that this
19      was an addictive drug.
20           And the undisputed evidence in this case in
21      that 1981 FTC study is that the majority of
22      Americans did not think it was.
23           Can you put up the Horn slide, please?
24           Your Honor, are you going to cut me off right
25      at 4:30? 3358
1           THE COURT:  Well, hold on a second.  At 4:31
2      you'll have 12 minutes left.
3           MR. SALES:  Oh, sorry.
4           THE COURT:  So you have about 15 minutes,
5      approximately.
6           MR. SALES:  You may remember -- sorry, Judge.
7           THE COURT:  That's all right.
8           MR. SALES:  You may remember that when
9      Dr. Burns was here and after counsel talked about
10      Dr. Daniel Horn, he said, you know, those matters
11      really need to be put in context.  He said when
12      we're talking about shouting from the rooftops, the
13      important part of the message was, you know, we are
14      trying to inform people, but something's missing.
15           Do you have that slide about the cigarette
16      consumption?  Go back just a moment.
17           So in 1978, when, according to counsel, it was
18      already too late for Mr. Ellis, --
19           MR. PERSONS:  Objection, Your Honor.
20           THE COURT:  Sustained.  That's not actually
21      what he said.
22           MR. SALES:  According to counsel, Dr. Burns's
23      opinion suggests that by 1978, it was already too
24      late for Mr. Ellis --
25           MR. PERSONS:  Same objection. 3359
1           THE COURT:  Sustained.  That's not what he
2      said.  The argument was if he had stopped smoking
3      by 1978, he wouldn't -- he would have had a good
4      chance to survive.
5           MR. SALES:  Well, let's just take a look --
6      thank you, Your Honor, I'm sorry.  Thank you for
7      the correction.
8           In 1978, that's still relatively speaking at
9      the peak level of consumption in the country, and
10      it's consistent with, a hundred percent consistent
11      with that chapter 3 of the 1981 FTC report, and
12      it's only really after that point in time when
13      there is a steep decline in the rate of smoking in
14      this country.  And what's the reason for that?
15           Go back, if you would, please, to Dr. Horn.
16           "It's crucial for a person to know why he
17      smokes if he is to quit.  If you don't have any
18      understanding of why you do it, the problem's more
19      serious."
20           In this case, in that declining consumption of
21      cigarettes is proof of that very fact.  Because
22      this was in 1965.  And as you heard, Dr. Horn was a
23      leading public health official.  It wasn't until 23
24      years later when Dr. Koop, who was the Surgeon
25      General then, first issued the report that's in 3360
1      evidence indicating that nicotine is an addictive
2      drug.
3           And that, we suggest to you, is an important
4      part of understanding not only the decline in
5      consumption rapidly after that point in time,
6      because what do we know from the record in this
7      case that happened?
8           You've heard in the evidence in this case that
9      it was at that point in time and thereafter that
10      people, doctors, scientists, researchers, began to
11      address the issue of smoking as one of addiction.
12      And that meant the development of therapies that
13      had not existed during the overwhelming majority of
14      Sonny Ellis's lifetime.
15           But importantly, and it couldn't have been
16      said any better by the same fellow that you've seen
17      in slide after slide during this trial by Dr. Horn.
18      He wasn't saying why people are smoking.  He was
19      saying it's important to understand why they do.
20           And in that respect, we would ask that when
21      you go back into the jury room, you take the
22      opportunity to review document after document after
23      document or at least on behalf of Mrs. Ellis some
24      of them.
25           Dr. Jaffe told you that smoking -- the 3361
1      nicotine in the smoke is not a big deal.  That's
2      not right.  It is the only thing that matters.
3           You have in evidence not only the 1988 Surgeon
4      General's Report, but this was mentioned yesterday,
5      but you have portions of the 2010 Surgeon General's
6      Report as well.  And what they teach us is that
7      nicotine is the reason that people smoke.
8           Not a plaintiff's lawyer, not a plaintiff's
9      expert, not a defense lawyer, not a defense expert.
10      A neutral scientist studying the consensus of all
11      the scientific evidence in the community.  And what
12      they tell us, as you recall, I think it was raised
13      even yesterday in Dr. Jaffe's cross-examination, is
14      that nicotine is the reason that people smoke.
15           But there's more to it than that.  Because
16      when you get to the question of cause, the but-for
17      issue in this case, and I would ask you to consider
18      the question, the same question that Mr. Persons
19      asked you when he was asking you to compare
20      Mr. Ellis to all of those folks who quit, some of
21      whom quit over and over again, as I've suggested to
22      you, but I would ask you to compare Mr. Ellis to
23      some of those folks who didn't, some of those folks
24      who continued to smoke in those decades prior to
25      1988, and with the other curve that you saw from 3362
1      lung cancer, how many of them passed away.
2           And why do we ask you to do it that way?
3      Because, members of the jury, just as the industry
4      acknowledged and Mr. Gustafson touched on some of
5      that, I'm not going to repeat these points, they
6      believed what they were doing worked.
7           Is there any party, is there anybody, is there
8      a major corporation that spends untold millions of
9      dollars outspending the United States Government in
10      the way that they did, even with the urgency of the
11      lung cancer epidemic, is there any party that
12      spends that kind of money for no reason at all, and
13      the executives for American Tobacco, predecessor to
14      R.J. Reynolds, R.J. Reynolds, they told you the
15      answer to that, and the answer is no.
16           So when you get to the issue of causation on
17      the fraud claims, the fraud by concealment and the
18      conspiracy to conceal, I urge you to consider these
19      questions.  Didn't Sonny Ellis have the right to
20      know that whether it was 1972 to '78 and now and
21      then, but didn't he have the right to know?  And
22      there are American Tobacco documents in evidence,
23      not all of them were gone over with you.
24           What they were doing with what they called
25      Compound W?  It's in evidence.  Didn't he have the 3363
1      right to know about the removal of the nicotine?
2      There wasn't any label on these products explaining
3      these things.  And how they put it back in?
4           Didn't he have the right to know that
5      reconstituted tobacco actually makes cigarettes
6      more addictive?  Didn't he have the right to know
7      that cigarettes with ammonia compounds changes the
8      way that the nicotine enters your brain?
9           And ask yourself if, during the 1960s and '70s
10      and '80s, when the defendants' co-conspirator was
11      comparing Mr. Ellis and all of his fellow smokers
12      to lab rats motivated to push a lever for another
13      reward of nicotine, if he had known that's the way
14      that he was being treated as a customer of this
15      company, ask yourself whether or not it would have
16      made a difference to him.
17           You have the information, because they have
18      taken extraordinary measures to tell you how smart
19      Sonny Ellis was and what he did when he needed to
20      do something when he was armed with the right
21      information.
22           I want to say one thing about motivation and
23      then I want to say one thing about money.
24           This case does not paint a picture of a man
25      who stubbornly refused to quit smoking.  That's 3364
1      their case.
2           This case paints a picture of a man who
3      believed, at least to some extent, and just enough
4      to grab the next cigarette, that these things maybe
5      just weren't causing him the harm that he was
6      hearing about.
7           And there is no evidence in this case that he
8      ever knew, contrary to what counsel says, this
9      wasn't reported at the time of King James, what
10      they do to their cigarettes.
11           There is no evidence that he knew those
12      things.  And we ask you to consider whether he or
13      any person armed with the information that we have
14      today, when you look at the 2010 Surgeon General's
15      booklet for consumers and you see what's reported
16      now, cigarettes are designed for addiction.  And
17      what is the prevalence of smoking in this country
18      today?  20 percent.
19           And they want to tell you in every instance,
20      whether it's the lung cancer, whether it's the
21      addiction, whether it's the lung cancer causation
22      on every one of these things, Sonny Ellis is an
23      outlier.  He's an aberration.  He's in that tiny
24      minority of folks who don't get addicted.  He's in
25      that tiny minority. 3365
1           I think Dr. Okun said it was 3 percent of
2      people whose cancer is a mystery.  He's in that 3
3      percent.  He's in that tiny minority of people.
4      Look at what happened in the population when the
5      defendants' co-conspirators lies unraveled over
6      time.
7           And just lastly a couple things about money
8      and about punitive damages.
9           Mr. Gustafson did not tell you to award a
10      particular amount of money.  What he told you
11      instead was to do what you think is right, but he
12      asked you to place a ceiling on what you might
13      consider as a fair and just award based on the
14      instructions and the law that His Honor has given
15      you, and that is our request.
16           Our request is that you do that and that you
17      by your verdict speak not only to the loss that
18      Mrs. Ellis has experienced in these 20-plus years
19      on her own, and the nature of her loss in what she
20      had to observe as her husband literally, the way
21      they would argue it to you, smoke, smoke, smoked
22      that cigarette.
23           And finally, on comparative fault and punitive
24      damages, this case is not a case that suggests zero
25      responsibility for this defendant.  The measure 3366
1      that Mr. Gustafson suggested to you, 80 percent
2      fault on this defendant, in light of their superior
3      knowledge, because Dr. Jaffe said, you know,
4      Mr. Ellis knew as much as anybody else.
5           And you know that to be false.  You know that
6      they knew so much more about their products and
7      what they were doing to Sonny Ellis than he ever
8      could, unless he had lived to see all of the things
9      that you have seen in this courtroom.
10           Finally, punitive damages.  Have we proven by
11      the clear and convincing evidence, because it is a
12      different standard, that these -- this defendant
13      deserves to be punished for the things that they
14      did, not stupid things, but outrageous things.
15           And your decision in that regard should speak
16      in accordance with the Court's instructions, not to
17      deter Reynolds from doing something which is now
18      out in the light.  Members of the jury, no, that
19      would be an unjust verdict.  To punish them for
20      what they did and to deter, as the law says, others
21      from ever doing something like that again.
22           I think, Your Honor, I hit it about on the
23      head, did I?
24           THE COURT:  Yeah, you've got four -- well,
25      you've actually got three and a half minutes if you 3367
1      want to use them.
2           MR. SALES:  It would be the first time that a
3      rebuttal argument has concluded with time left
4      over, hopefully I won't be criticized by my
5      colleagues for that, but thank you very much
6      everyone.  And on behalf of Ms. Ellis and
7      Mr. Norton, Miss Stark, Mr. Scott, Mr. Norton, last
8      but not least certainly, Mr. Telofski, thank you
9      very much.
10           MR. NORTON:  You forgot Mr. Gustafson.
11           MR. SALES:  Oh, sorry.
12           MR. NORTON:  But you gave me twice.
13           MR. SALES:  Oh.
