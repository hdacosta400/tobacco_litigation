7          MS. SHAMP:  Thank you, Your Honor.
8          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  First I
9     want to thank you.  This has been a pretty long two
10     and-a-half weeks, and a lot of evidence has been
11     presented to you, and I know that you were paying
12     attention.  You were listening and you were taking
13     notes.
14          And so what I'm not going to do today is to
15     rehash all of the evidence that's been presented,
16     because I know that you were paying attention.  But
17     what I do want to do this morning is to try and put
18     some of the evidence that you've been presented in
19     perspective, and I want to talk in detail about what
20     it is that you're going to be called upon to decide,
21     because you've got a lot of evidence that is
22     relevant to the questions that are on the verdict
23     form that the court just talked to you about, and
24     you've got evidence that is irrelevant and that
25     you're not going to be needing to decide.  So what I 3533
1     want to do today is to talk about some of those
2     things.
3          Now, when I got up here in the very beginning
4     of the case you'll remember I said that you're going
5     to hear a lot of evidence, and some of it would
6     sound like a movie script.  And you did.
7          You heard evidence about destroying documents.
8     You'll remember that the evidence was presented.
9     And every time when I'm talking today you'll see
10     that there is a number on the bottom of the screen
11     for the exhibit number.  And you'll have back with
12     you binders, and all of these documents will be back
13     in evidence with you so that you can look at them.
14     And you'll remember P287.
15          Once it becomes clear that such action is
16     necessary for the successful defense of our present
17     and future suits we will promptly remove all such
18     reports from our files.
19          You remember I asked Dr. Figlar about that.
20          And you saw documents about deceit.  Absolute
21     deceit committed against the American public.  The
22     false and misleading advertising regarding filter-
23     tip cigarettes where the conclusion of the report to
24     congress was that cigarette manufacturers have
25     deceived the American public through their 3534
1     advertising of filter-tip cigarettes.
2          And you heard evidence about deception.  You
3     heard evidence about how R.J. Reynolds knew that
4     there were carcinogens in their tobacco smoke, that
5     they knew that there was a link between smoking and
6     lung cancer, and they submitted the Frank Statement
7     that went through -- and you saw how many newspapers
8     that was published in.  And you'll have those
9     documents where they said to the American public
10     that there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one
11     of the causes of lung cancer.
12          And you saw evidence of fraud.  You saw these
13     documents where it said that very few consumers are
14     aware of the effects of nicotine because we haven't
15     told them its addictive nature and that nicotine is
16     poison.  They knew that their own customers didn't
17     know this.
18          And you saw evidence of greed.  It's fortunate
19     for us that cigarettes are a habit they can't break.
20     It's fortunate for us because we make a fortune off
21     of it.  You saw evidence of nicotine manipulation.
22     You saw their documents where they indicated they
23     were manipulating nicotine levels.
24          You saw evidence of conspiracy, where the very
25     heads of the greatest corporations themselves 3535
1     signalized the end of the old days when they linked
2     arms and walked together to consult with us.
3          I told you you would see evidence of a story of
4     greed that is unparalleled in American history.
5     Unparalleled because of the scope of it, how long it
6     went on.  Unparalleled because of the amount of
7     documents that we now know, and that you are
8     entitled to see.  And unparalleled in the cost of
9     human life.  And you'll have with you the Surgeon
10     General's report where it talks about the cost of
11     that life.
12          And you'll have that entire report from 2014.
13     You should look at it.  It's Exhibit 799.  More than
14     20 million premature deaths are attributable to
15     smoking, and smoking-attributable mortality is
16     estimated to be about 480,000 a year.  That's 1200
17     people in America, in America every day as a result
18     of smoking cigarettes.
19          And through the evidence we told you the story
20     about greed; how in the 1950's, when more than 50
21     percent of Americans smoked cigarettes, when it was
22     advertised by athletes, celebrities, on television
23     programs, on cartoons, that Wynder and Graham
24     painted tobacco tar on the back of mice and
25     discovered that in more than 60 percent of the mice 3536
1     tumors developed, and that this was big news, and
2     that big tobacco was scared.
3          And so they sent their own researchers to
4     investigate what do we know, and Claude Teague came
5     up with this is what we know.  And you'll remember
6     he surveyed all the literature out there, and he
7     reported this to R.J. Reynolds, that the studies
8     tend to confirm the relationship between heavy and
9     prolonged tobacco smoking and cancer of the lung.
10     1953 they knew that.  And that benzpyrene and
11     (a)benzpyrene, both carcinogens, were identified in
12     distillates of cigarette smoke.  R.J. Reynolds knew
13     that.  And they came to a fork in the road.  They
14     came to a fork in the road and they decided to lie.
15          I suspect that you're going to hear a lot from
16     Mr. Geise in his closing argument about choice.  And
17     I think this case is about choice.  The choice they
18     made to lie.
19          They were the ones who had the power and
20     resources to know about their product, and they had
21     an obligation to tell us.  And there is no dispute
22     about that.  And that is fraud.
23          And remember, Dr. Figlar himself, when he came
24     and testified, said, all right -- I asked him:  All
25     right.  Now, you agree, don't you, that R.J. 3537
1     Reynolds has a responsibility to tell its customers
2     what it knows about the health consequences of the
3     use of its -- of the product it sells?  He says, I
4     mean, I believe so, yeah.  And you agree that it has
5     a duty to tell the truth?  And he said, sure, yes.
6     And a duty to disclose what it knows.  There is no
7     dispute about that, that they had a duty to tell.
8     And they lied.
9          They came to a fork in the road in the choices
10     they made, with the evidence that you've heard.  And
11     you heard about how they lied and what they decided
12     to do.
13          They denied that cigarette smoking was
14     dangerous.  And you saw the press releases.  You saw
15     the individuals that went on television, Ann Browder
16     and Cullman, denying it.  And they declared that
17     there was doubt.  And you'll remember the papers
18     that they sent out, the white papers, declaring that
19     there was doubt about the harmfulness.
20          And they deceived the American public by vowing
21     to take out any harmful elements if they found it.
22     The great filter lie that kept America smoking.  It
23     was hugely successful.  And you'll remember that
24     witnesses talked about that, about how many people
25     during that decade switched to filters, because they 3538
1     believed that that was not harmful.
2          You heard testimony about the meeting in 1953
3     at the Plaza Hotel where they decided, when they
4     knew that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, to
5     hire a public relations firm.  Instead of deciding
6     how can we tell people, how can we get warnings on
7     the packages, how can we let people know, they
8     decided to hire a public relations firm.
9          And then through the next four decades they
10     sold doubt.  Wasn't really even important to sell
11     cigarettes anymore.  What they sold was doubt to
12     keep people buying cigarettes.  And that's their own
13     document.  Doubt is our product.
14          See, what they're trying to get is, sure the
15     Surgeon General is coming out and saying things, and
16     other people are coming out and saying things, but
17     what they want to do is just plant that seed of
18     doubt.  Plant that little seed of doubt.
19          Well, I don't smoke four packs a day.  I'm
20     okay.  I'm healthy.  I exercise.  I'm okay.  I smoke
21     filters or menthols.  I'm okay.
22          That's what they did.  They planted that little
23     seed of doubt to keep people smoking, because they
24     knew they were addicted and they wanted that doubt.
25     These were lies that they told. 3539
1          So I said in the beginning of this case that I
2     would tell you a story about greed and fraud and
3     lies, and also a story about addiction.  And you
4     heard that story.
5          You heard the story of Betty Owens in the
6     nursing home in the middle of the night calling her
7     children saying, I need cigarettes, bring them to
8     me.  You heard the story about her leaving her
9     daughter's home to go down in the basement.  Just
10     image the picture.  She's down in the basement
11     pulling on a cigarette.
12          You heard a story of addiction, and you also
13     heard testimony about how big a problem addiction is
14     in America and how we're trying just now to figure
15     out ways to treat it.
16          The lies that they told were intentional, they
17     were conscious, and it was a choice they made.  And
18     I said it was about greed, because all of them were
19     for one reason.  One reason.  Profit.  To continue
20     to make more money, never once caring about the
21     public health of the country they lived in, never
22     once caring about who was getting addicted to their
23     product.
24          When I started this trial I asked you -- I said
25     one thing that concerns me is that we become jaded. 3540
1     We hear a lot of stories about corporate greed or
2     corporations make decisions.  So the tendency to
3     kind of let these things wash over, especially in a
4     trial like this where you hear it so much.  But I
5     ask you to pay attention to each of those documents
6     and look carefully at what they show, and how they
7     show a real callous indifference to human life for
8     their product.
9          And so today, finally today is the day that you
10     have to decide that that conduct needs to be
11     punished, that that conduct is not victimless, that
12     it caused harm.
13          You see, they want you to believe -- no, they
14     want you to decide that their greed and their fraud
15     and their lies is victimless.  They want you to
16     decide that they didn't harm anybody.
17          They want to blame -- no, they want you to
18     blame Betty Owens, not 5 percent, not a portion of
19     it.  They want you to blame Betty Owens 100 percent.
20          When I was working last night trying to think
21     about what I was going to say to you one word kept
22     coming up, and I thought I needed to talk to you
23     about it.  And that word is the truth.  That's what
24     we're here about.
25          What is the truth?  And I'll assert that R.J. 3541
1     Reynolds has had a very loose association with the
2     truth from the beginning.  The truth.
3          So I want to talk about some things that
4     happened in this courtroom about the truth.  Joel
5     Dubow.  You remember him.  He was the guy that wrote
6     this article that the defendants used to try and
7     cross Marvin Goldberg.  You remember Dr. Goldberg on
8     the stand.  And they tried to use this to say, oh,
9     what you say about Joe Camel's not true.  There's no
10     studies that support that Joe Camel increased the
11     risk of smoking for kids.
12          And they put up this article, and you remember
13     me objecting to the article, and you also remember
14     my team starting to work when that happened.  And
15     what we came up with was, well, in fact, Joel Dubow
16     was on R.J. Reynolds' payroll.  And you saw that
17     evidence, and we presented it on redirect after we
18     took a break and were able to come up with these
19     documents, these documents that show that he was in
20     communication with R.J. Reynolds before he wrote the
21     article, documents that show that R.J. Reynolds was
22     funding his research, documents that show that Joel
23     Dubow was actually looking for a job.
24          What's the truth?  The evidence that they put
25     up, the truth?  This is a document from 1996 saying 3542
1     we're going to give an all-expense paid trip up to
2     see R.J. Reynolds.
3          And that's the document that they tried to
4     cross Marvin Goldberg with, was a document written
5     by Joel Dubow, their guy.
6          Did they tell you that?  Did they tell you that
7     was their guy?  No.
8          Charles Golden.  You'll remember when Dr.
9     Proctor was on the stand and he talked about that
10     Stanley Frank had written the True article.  Y'all
11     will remember that.  And that True article, and
12     Stanley Frank was an employee of Hill & Knowlton,
13     and he wrote that article that said there was no
14     harm, that smoking didn't cause lung cancer, that
15     the link had not been proven yet.  And that article
16     was re-put in the National Enquirer.  And remember
17     Dr. Proctor talked about that.
18          Then they got up and tried to cross examine Dr.
19     Proctor, and remember they showed him a National
20     Enquirer from three years earlier that had the name
21     Charles Golden attached, and said to Dr. Proctor,
22     well, you're not right.  Charles Golden is not a
23     made-up name.  He was writing articles three years
24     before.
25          So we had to go to work again.  And you'll 3543
1     remember we came back -- that's the National
2     Enquirer article.  And you'll remember we came back
3     with the FTC report after the FTC had done a study
4     and showed in fact it was Stanley Frank who had
5     written the National Enquirer article, and, in fact,
6     Charles Golden was the name the National Enquirer
7     used.
8          Stanley Frank, who at this time was an employee
9     of Hill & Knowlton, was contacted and persuaded to
10     write an article for the Enquirer.  The use of the
11     name Charles Golden was the normal house byline used
12     by the Enquirer to keep the identity of the author
13     confidential.  We told you the truth.  And the list
14     goes on and on.
15          You'll remember when Dr. Figlar got on the
16     stand he talked and talked about all the things R.J.
17     Reynolds was doing to reduce harm.  Remember all of
18     that?  We're designing our cigarettes differently.
19     We're doing all these different things to reduce
20     harm.
21          And then I got up and cross examined him with
22     the 1994 Surgeon General report -- no, the 2010
23     Surgeon General's report, which says -- and that's
24     P487, which says:  Moreover, subsequent research
25     demonstrated that the use of ventilation holes -- 3544
1     that's one of the things he talked to you about as
2     being a way to reduce harm -- the use of ventilation
3     holes produced higher levels of freebase nicotine,
4     which led to a more addictive product, as well as
5     deeper lung inhalation of cooler and less harsh
6     smoke.
7          What's the truth?  And the list goes on and on.
8     And I think it's fair for you to ask, can I trust
9     any of the evidence that R.J. Reynolds puts up?
10          They formed a united front against the truth in
11     1953, and today they're not giving you the truth.
12          MR. GEISE:  Your Honor, I object.  May we
13     approach?
14          (Sidebar conference outside the hearing of the
15     jury.)
16          MR. GEISE:  These are litigation tactics today
17     that have taken place in the past.
18          Ms. Shamp says question everything, ask if
19     they're telling you the truth, and all that.  She
20     said it started in the 1970's.  You should ask that
21     today.
22          It's directly a violation of the prior order
23     and it's an implication that something started in
24     the 70's is continuing in this courtroom today, and
25     it's not permitted.  It's a violation of the 3545
1     pretrial order.
2          MS. SHAMP:  I'm entitled to comment upon the
3     evidence and the truth upon the evidence.  And what
4     I said was --
5          THE COURT:  One at a time.
6          MS. SHAMP:  Well, I most certainly am entitled
7     to say if they put up evidence that was subsequently
8     found to be not true I'm mostly entitled to comment
9     on that.  That's closing argument.
10          MR. GEISE:  She can comment about all the lies
11     that she's put up during this.  But the point of the
12     matter is she can't say this was 1970 and they're
13     still doing it today.
14          THE COURT:  I think you can comment if you
15     believe a piece of evidence is not factual.  I don't
16     think you can give the -- I think the way that was
17     stated I would have to agree with Mr. Geise, the
18     generality of the way it was stated I would have to
19     agree with Mr. Geise.
20          MS. SHAMP:  I can't say that -- I said in 1953
21     they formed the united front, and then I said -- I
22     believe I said and today they've put up evidence
23     that is not true.
24          THE COURT:  I think you can comment --
25          MS. SHAMP:  I can say that, today they put up 3546
1     evidence that is not true.
2          THE COURT:  I think you can comment on specific
3     evidence.  I think under the pretrial order that in
4     general you're not allowed to comment on litigation
5     tactics.  I think you can say the evidence presented
6     is not true.
7          MS. SHAMP:  That's what I did.
8          MR. GEISE:  When she linked it to something in
9     the past that's not what she's doing.
10          THE COURT:  I think what he's saying is in the
11     totality of it when it's linked today I think it's
12     violating the spirit of the pretrial order.  I think
13     that's what he's saying.
14          MR. GEISE:  And I was ready for it, because Ms.
15     Shamp has done this in the last two trials I've had
16     with her.  We've been to sidebar.  So I knew it was
17     coming, it was just a matter of when.
18          THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
19          (Following sidebar.)
20          MS. SHAMP:  Is the evidence they put up the
21     truth?
22          Now, R.J. Reynolds has put up a lot of
23     distraction through this case.  Distractions like
24     she didn't die from lung cancer, they're not our
25     cigarettes that she smoked, she knew it was harmful, 3547
1     Ken Ellis wrote a letter to his uncle, cancer wasn't
2     caused by smoking, it was caused by something else,
3     she smoked because she enjoyed it.  They put up a
4     lot of distraction evidence.
5          So what I want to do now is I want to talk
6     about what the evidence is, because when you go back
7     in the jury room you're probably thinking you have
8     one job, and that is to deliberate and reach a
9     verdict.  But you actually have two jobs back there.
10     The other job is that you have to discuss with your
11     fellow jurors why you hold the positions you do,
12     what the evidence is to support the positions that
13     you're going to take.
14          And so I want to talk about what the evidence
15     is and how it proves the things that we're supposed
16     to prove.
17          So before I do that I want to talk about the
18     burden of proof.  And the court just instructed you
19     on the burden of proof, and the court told you that
20     the plaintiff has the burden of proof to prove his
21     claims by the greater weight of the evidence.
22          And since we're in a courtroom I like to think
23     of it like the scales of justice.  We have to put
24     our evidence that tilts the scale.  When you put --
25          MR. GEISE:  Your Honor, it's contrary to your 3548
1     order and the instruction you gave.
2          THE COURT:  Why don't you all approach sidebar.
3          (Sidebar conference outside the hearing of the
4     jury.)
5          THE COURT:  I believe that during jury
6     selection I sustained the defense's objection about
7     the issue of the scales of justice, that being not
8     an instruction on the law that is appropriate.
9          MS. SHAMP:  Well, I think it -- it was not
10     appropriate to talk about what our burden of proof
11     is when we're in -- before the court had instructed
12     them and we were in voir dire.
13          I'm certainly entitled to talk about what the
14     burden of proof is, what it means, what greater
15     weight of the evidence means.  Isn't that what every
16     lawyer does in closing argument?
17          MR. GEISE:  Greater weight of the evidence
18     doesn't mean tipping the scales just a little bit.
19     That's misleading.  That's the reason it was
20     sustained in voir dire and it should be sustained
21     again.
22          THE COURT:  Since it is closing argument and I
23     don't think you're going to focus on the scales I
24     will allow you to continue.
25          (Following sidebar.) 3549
1          MS. SHAMP:  Plaintiff has to prove his case by
2     a greater weight of the evidence.  So what I'm going
3     to do throughout my closing argument is to talk
4     about what the evidence is on either side of the
5     issues that you're going to be called upon to
6     decide.  Line them up.  What is the evidence over
7     here?  What is the evidence over here?  And where is
8     the greater weight.
9          All right.  Now, the judge just instructed you
10     about what the evidence is.  Okay.  And in this case
11     you've got four categories of documents that are the
12     evidence presented.  You've got internal documents
13     from R.J. Reynolds.  A lot of them.  We'll talk
14     about some of them today, but there's a lot more in
15     the binders that will go back with you.  And all of
16     those documents are evidence, and that means you can
17     look at all of them, all of them in deciding the
18     various issues you're going to be called upon to
19     decide.
20          The second category is government documents and
21     other documents.  And you've heard a lot about the
22     Surgeon General's reports.  All of those are
23     evidence.  You can rely upon those reports in
24     deciding the issues you have to decide.
25          You've got FTC reports back there.  Look at 3550
1     them.  Those will contain evidence that will help
2     you in deciding the issues you're going to be called
3     upon to decide.
4          And all of that, not just the testimony from
5     the stand, but all of these things are evidence that
6     you can utilize in order to reach your decisions.
7          Of course the testimony of the witnesses that
8     you've heard, and there's also medical records from
9     Betty Owens, including her death certificate.
10          So all of these things together are the
11     evidence that you have with you in order to consider
12     the issues that you're going to have to decide.
13          So the first issue that you have to decide is
14     class membership.  And the judge talked to you about
15     that.  So I want to talk to you about it just a
16     little bit again.  The Engle class action.
17          And you'll recall we said in opening statement
18     that the Engle class action began in 1994.  Okay.
19     Again, just a year after her death this class
20     started.  And the Engle class action was tried to a
21     jury for over a year in 1999, and they heard all
22     kinds of evidence, some of the same evidence you
23     heard in this two and-a-half weeks, but a lot of
24     evidence.
25          And that jury made certain findings.  And after 3551
1     the jury made findings those went up to the Florida
2     Supreme Court, and the Florida Supreme Court
3     affirmed the Engle verdict, and then we brought this
4     case.
5          And what you have to decide is whether Betty
6     Owens is one of the people who fits within the class
7     membership definition so that she is part of -- I
8     put her picture there -- so she is part of the class
9     action.
10          That's the first issue you are called upon to
11     decide.  And if you do then you get the benefit of
12     the Engle findings.  I'm not going to go through
13     each one of these now.  You're going to have them in
14     your jury instructions.
15          So what is the definition of class membership?
16     The judge just instructed you.  To prove that Betty
17     Owens was a member of the Engle class, plaintiff
18     must prove by a greater weight of the evidence that
19     Betty Owens was addicted to cigarettes containing
20     nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal
21     cause of her lung cancer and death.  Pretty simple.
22     And that is question one on the verdict form.
23          When I was trying to figure out how I would
24     organize my comments to you today I decided that the
25     most effective way to talk to you about the issues 3552
1     that you were going to decide is to actually go
2     through the verdict form one at a time, and what
3     those questions are, and what the evidence is with
4     respect to each of those questions so that we can
5     talk about where the greater weight is, and what
6     evidence was presented on these issues.
7          So question one basically has three parts.  The
8     first part is addiction.  Was Betty Owens addicted?
9     And you heard a lot of evidence about that.
10          But it's very important that you understand
11     what the question is not.  The question is not
12     whether she could quit.
13          Now, when you get to the part of the jury(sic)
14     form about comparative fault, those are some things
15     you might talk about, figure out, whether she could
16     quit.  But it is not -- and nobody said that whether
17     or not she could quit determined whether she was
18     addicted.  Even Dr. Hayes said that addicted smokers
19     quit.  Addicted people who use heroin quit.
20          So the question is not on addiction whether or
21     not she could quit.  The question is not whether she
22     tried hard enough to quit.  It's not whether she was
23     motivated to quit.  None of those things come into
24     play on question one.  Whether she knew smoking was
25     harmful, whether she chose to smoke.  The question 3553
1     is was she addicted.  It's quite simple.
2          So what is the evidence about addiction?  One,
3     the evidence is that nicotine is an addictive drug
4     that changes the brain.  It actually causes physical
5     changes that are measurable.  We can look at them in
6     the brain.
7          We know that nicotine is a drug.  Everybody
8     agrees to that.  We know nicotine is addictive.
9     Everybody agrees to that.  And we know it changes
10     the brain.  All of the evidence on those things is
11     undisputed.  You actually had pictures of PET scans
12     of the brain showing how the brain in an addicted
13     smoker is changed by the nicotinic receptors in
14     there.
15          You have evidence that 80 percent -- 80 percent
16     of smokers try and quit every year.  It's sort of an
17     amazing statistic.  And less than 5 percent are
18     successful.
19          You heard evidence that the longer you smoke,
20     the more you smoke, the greater the likelihood is
21     that you are addicted.
22          Okay.  So this is what we learned about
23     nicotine and addiction.  We learned these things,
24     this evidence.  We also learned that beginning
25     smoking in the early teens increases the likelihood 3554
1     of addiction.  And you'll remember the slide that
2     Dr. Werner showed you and talked about how the brain
3     is not fully developed, and because it's not fully
4     developed, if you introduce a substance into the
5     brain, not just nicotine, but any substance,
6     alcohol, that teens who start utilizing a substance
7     have a much higher risk of becoming addicted to
8     those substances.  That's why it's so critically
9     important to keep drugs out of our children's lives.
10          And this is a picture that has the frontal
11     cortex of the brain, how it isn't developed yet.
12          All right.  So what is the evidence that she
13     was addicted?  One, we've got nicotine is an
14     addictive drug that changes the brain.  Cigarettes
15     have nicotine in them.  That's what she was exposed
16     to.  We know those things.  We know her brain was
17     changed by it.
18          We have evidence of Betty Owens smoking.  Now,
19     we know that from the witnesses who testified.  So
20     we have evidence from Martha Schofield, her
21     daughter, from Ken Ellis, her son, and from Bernice
22     Birdwell, her brother.  And they talked about her
23     smoking.  We learned that she smoked between a pack
24     and a pack and-a-half a day.
25          All right.  Now, it's interesting to think 3555
1     about.  If somebody enjoyed smoking, if they smoked
2     because they liked it, would they consistently smoke
3     a pack a day every day?  No.  And the defendants
4     know that.  We know that from their documents.
5          We know she smoked for 44 years; that she was
6     ingesting that brain-changing drug for 44 years at a
7     pack and-a-half a day -- pack to a pack and-a-half a
8     day.
9          She began smoking when she was 13 years old.
10     Undisputed.  And we know she smoked first thing in
11     the morning, all during the day, smoked in the
12     evening, smoked in bed at night.  So we know a lot
13     about her smoking behavior, the way she smoked.
14          We also know that she had withdrawal symptoms
15     and cravings.  That's undisputed.  Undisputed that
16     she was fidgety, anxious, from the people who
17     observed her when she wasn't able to smoke.  She got
18     fidgety, restless, anxious, irritable.  And you
19     heard that from her daughter and from her son.  And
20     that she had cravings.  That's undisputed.  In the
21     middle of the night calling and asking her son.
22     Going downstairs in the basement at her daughter's
23     house.  Going in and out of her son's house when she
24     was there.  She had cravings for nicotine.
25     Undisputed. 3556
1          And she meets the DSM-5 criteria for nicotine
2     addiction.  You'll recall Dr. Werner actually took
3     the book and went through the criterion.  And these
4     are the 11 criteria in the book.
5          It's the same book that Dr. Hayes said is the
6     book, and Dr. Werner said is the book.
7          Dr. Werner went through every category.  Didn't
8     give her all the categories.  Gave her 8 of the 11.
9     And she talked about each one of those categories,
10     so that she met the DSM-5 definition for addiction
11     in the category severe.
12          And then of course you had Dr. Werner's opinion
13     that she was addicted.  Dr. Werner testified to
14     that.
15          I'm listing what all the evidence is that she
16     was addicted on one side.
17          Dr. Werner, as you'll remember, is a medical
18     doctor.  She is board certified in two specialties,
19     she's double-board certified.  She's the
20     vice-chairman of the department of psychiatry at the
21     University of Florida.  She's also an assistant
22     professor and director at the forensic psychiatric
23     division.  She's the director there at the
24     University of Florida.  She teaches medical students
25     about addiction and about the DSM.  She is the 3557
1     director of all inpatient psychiatric care at the
2     University of Florida.
3          Now, we kind of split up her testimony.  She
4     did her qualifications one day and her testimony the
5     next day, but you'll recall she said she's in charge
6     of all inpatient psychiatric care at the University
7     of Florida, and that she currently sees, treats, and
8     prescribes for patients with addiction.  Sees,
9     treats, and prescribes for patients with addiction,
10     including nicotine addiction.  She's published
11     journal articles on addiction, and she's been
12     appointed by the governor to review cases and
13     testify in court.  She's a highly-respected expert
14     in the state of Florida, and her testimony was that
15     Betty Owens was addicted, based upon the DSM-5 and
16     her clinical judgment.
17          But you don't only have that.  You also have
18     R.J. Reynolds' internal documents, which you can
19     consider when looking at the issue of addiction.
20     R.J. Reynolds' own documents, P302, say that they
21     know nicotine is a potent drug.  It's a potent drug
22     with pharmacological effects.
23          This is document P302:  The tobacco industry
24     may be thought of as being specialized, highly
25     ritualized, and a stylized segment of the 3558
1     pharmaceutical industry.  Tobacco products uniquely
2     contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug.
3          And you'll see throughout their documents that
4     they describe their product as a nicotine delivery
5     device.  It is a nicotine delivery device.
6          Their document, P285, describes it as the sine
7     qua non.  That means without which -- sine, without.
8     Without which nothing.  They describe a cigarette
9     without nicotine as without which there is nothing.
10     It is the reason that people smoke cigarettes, is to
11     get the nicotine.  It is the sine qua non, nicotine,
12     of smoking.
13          And then they talk about in their own documents
14     how they have to put enough nicotine in the smoke of
15     their products sufficient to supply the necessary
16     requirements of the smoker.  The requirements of the
17     smoker.  It's their dose.  Their addiction and their
18     dose.
19          They know it's an addiction.  Fortunately for
20     us it's a habit they can't break.  They know that
21     their product is deeply addictive.  Not only know
22     it, they count on it.  They design their products to
23     do that.  And yet they come in today and say she's
24     not addicted.  She smoked because she enjoyed it.
25          The evidence that we have put on that Betty 3559
1     Owens was addicted -- I said we should put them on
2     two sides of the scale.  What is the evidence that
3     she was addicted?  And we put -- we spent a lot of
4     time doing it, putting on evidence about addiction.
5     We put on a lot of evidence about addiction.
6          And what evidence is there that she was not
7     addicted?  That's it.  Dr. Jill Hayes.
8          Now, I say doctor because she's a psychologist.
9     She is not a medical doctor.  Remember that
10     testimony.  She is not board certified in anything.
11     There are board certifications in psychology.  She
12     has no board certifications.  She's never written or
13     published about addiction.  She's not listed as an
14     expert on addiction anywhere.  Remember when Ms.
15     Bryan pulled up the website?  Doesn't list
16     addiction.  She does not treat patients with
17     nicotine addiction.  I was surprised when she said
18     that from the stand.  She doesn't even treat
19     patients who have nicotine addiction.  She does not
20     currently teach.  She can't even prescribe
21     medications.  She can't prescribe medications to
22     treat nicotine addiction.
23          But what did she even say?  She stood in front
24     of you -- sat in front of you and listed her five
25     factors.  You remember.  These are my five factors 3560
1     for why I say she's not addicted.
2          Here are her five factors:  Cognitive capacity,
3     awareness, personality, smoking, and quitting.
4          Where did she get these five factors?  She
5     testified that it's the DSM-5.  Remember?  She said,
6     I used the DSM-5.  These are not in the DSM-5.  Her
7     five factors are not in any publication.  Her five
8     factors that she used she had no support for.  She
9     didn't even go through the DSM criteria.
10          I thought it was an extraordinarily telling
11     question from the jury, why did you decide she was
12     not addicted?  Because she didn't even tell us.  She
13     didn't go through the DSM-5 criteria.  She said she
14     thought she could quit.  That was one of the reasons
15     she told you that she thought she was addicted,
16     because she thought she could quit.
17          If that's the standard, she could quit, no one
18     is addicted.  Nobody.  Everybody who testified said
19     that addicted people can quit.  It's not the
20     question you have to decide.
21          So where is the greater weight of the evidence?
22     We suggest that the far greater weight of the
23     evidence is that Betty Owens was addicted.
24          Okay.  The second thing you have to decide is
25     whether addiction caused her smoking.  The Surgeon 3561
1     General's report you'll have says that nicotine
2     addiction is the fundamental reason that people
3     persist in using tobacco products.  For the typical
4     smoker, nicotine satisfaction is the dominant
5     desire.  The dominant desire as opposed to flavor or
6     other satisfactions.
7          Their own document says:  We can't defend
8     continued smoking as free choice if the person was
9     addicted.  That's P363.
10          R.J. Reynolds' own documents prove that the
11     addiction caused her to smoke, that that's why she
12     smoked.  All the evidence regarding her smoking
13     behavior and Dr. Werner's testimony.
14          What was the evidence that she smoked for a
15     reasons other than addiction?  Dr. Hayes.  Remember
16     what Dr. Hayes said.  We asked her:  Dr. Hayes, you
17     cannot rule out nicotine as a reason that Betty
18     Owens smoked; is that correct.  No.  No, it's not
19     correct, or, no, it's correct?  No, I can't rule out
20     that nicotine was potentially a reason that she
21     smoked.  So even Dr. Hayes admits that she smoked --
22     or that she can't rule out that she smoked because
23     of nicotine.  So all of the evidence is that she
24     smoked because of her nicotine addiction.
25          And finally the last question is that her 3562
1     smoking caused lung cancer and death.  And of course
2     you remember a long time ago, several -- I guess the
3     first week, we put up -- the second week we put up
4     Dr. Wright.  And you'll remember Dr. Wright, he's a
5     pathologist and he was the chief medical examiner in
6     Dade County for a long time.  And Dr. Wright
7     testified that smoking was what caused her lung
8     cancer what caused her death.  We of course put up
9     her death certificate that she died from lung cancer
10     that had metastasized to her brain.  We also put up
11     medical records, and the medical records are in
12     evidence, that she died as a result of smoking and
13     lung cancer.
14          What is the evidence that something other than
15     smoking caused her lung cancer?  None.  Nothing.
16          Now, this is one of the things that the
17     defendants spent a enormous amount of time on.  And
18     let me say this, this is a very simple question, and
19     that is, R.J. Reynolds' brands are clearly one of
20     the causes of her smoking.
21          And I want to talk for just a minute about
22     this, because it's a point I think I need to clarify
23     that is not an issue that you have to worry about.
24          All right.  The testimony is that Betty Owens
25     smoked this list of brands:  Belair, Camel, Salem, 3563
1     Kool, Lucky Strike, Winston, Pall Mall, Benson &
2     Hedges, Raleigh, Marlboro, and Kent.  Okay?
3          MR. GEISE:  Your Honor, I object.  May we
4     approach?
5          (Sidebar conference outside the hearing of the
6     jury.)
7          MR. GEISE:  For the vast majority of the time
8     that Mrs. Owens was alive Benson & Hedges was a
9     Liggett brand cigarette, not Philip Morris.
10          MS. SHAMP:  My research shows that Benson &
11     Hedges was a Philip Morris product.  Now maybe
12     the --
13          MR. GEISE:  Late in life they bought it.
14          MS. SHAMP:  They bought it.
15          MR. GEISE:  The brand, not Liggett.
16          MS. SHAMP:  Well, if they bought the brand --
17          MR. GEISE:  They didn't buy the liability, they
18     bought the brand.
19          THE COURT:  Okay.  This is outside of my scope
20     of knowledge.
21          MR. GEISE:  I mean, it's just a -- again it's
22     just testimony that never came in the case about the
23     manufacturer of Benson & Hedges.  Ms. Shamp just put
24     up a slide in front of the jury that said it's
25     Philip Morris.  They have the stipulation on Philip 3564
1     Morris.  I'm sure that's what she's going to go to
2     next.  So it's misleading to put up a brand and
3     indicate it's manufactured by somebody else when
4     there's no evidence of that, there's no stipulation,
5     and then make whatever argument she's going to make.
6          THE COURT:  Well, I mean, if that is accurate
7     then I don't believe you can show that, if what he's
8     saying is true.  I do not have the knowledge of the
9     corporate structure of all of these cigarette brands
10     as you do, but if that's accurate, that would be --
11     I have no reason to question that that's not right.
12          MS. SHAMP:  What I know is that it's a Philip
13     Morris brand now.
14          MR. GEISE:  Now.
15          MS. SHAMP:  It is a Philip Morris brand now.
16     And so you know --
17          MR. GEISE:  And there was no evidence about
18     that whatsoever in the trial.
19          THE COURT:  You're right.
20          MR. GEISE:  So she's arguing evidence that's
21     not in this case.
22          MS. SHAMP:  All right.  I'll move on.
23          THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.
24          (Following sidebar.)
25          MS. SHAMP:  So you heard a lot of evidence 3565
1     about these brands.  All right.  Now, it's important
2     to know the vast majority of Winston, Salem, Kool,
3     Belair, those are all made either by R.J. Reynolds
4     or by one of its predecessors, Brown & Williamson or
5     American Tobacco.
6          All right.  Now, the court also read you a
7     stipulation, and what the stipulation says is that
8     Belair, Camel, Kook, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Salem,
9     and Winston cigarettes were manufactured in the
10     United States by Reynolds or its predecessor in
11     interest.  That's not an issue.  All those brands
12     are R.J. Reynolds.  They're responsible for all of
13     them.
14          Now, the other brands that were discussed that
15     are Philip Morris brands, they have stipulated.
16     This is an agreement.  And you remember the court
17     instructed you that you can consider all of the
18     evidence as well of the all the facts that parties
19     have agreed to.  And you'll have this in your jury
20     instructions.  This is actually one of the jury
21     instructions.  It says that any smoking by decedent
22     Betty Owens of any cigarette manufactured by
23     Lorillard or by Philip Morris was minimal and did
24     not directly and in natural and continuing sequence
25     produce or contribute substantially to producing any 3566
1     injury sustained by Betty Owens, if any, that was
2     caused by smoking cigarettes.
3          All right.  If there was use by Philip Morris
4     or Lorillard, those two manufacturers, of those
5     brands of cigarettes, the defendant has stipulated
6     that it was minimal and didn't contribute.
7          Okay.  Now, I suspect that they might say
8     something about the off brands that she smoked, and
9     there was some testimony that very occasionally that
10     there would be smoking by an off brand.
11          All right.  But what you have to understand is
12     read what the jury instructions say.  Okay.  In
13     order to be regarded as a legal cause of death an
14     addiction to cigarettes need not be the only cause.
15     Addiction to R.J. Reynolds' cigarettes may be a
16     legal cause of injury and death even though it
17     operates in combination with the act of another, or
18     some other cause, if some other cause occurs at the
19     same time as the addiction and the addiction
20     contributes substantially to producing such injury
21     and death.
22          All right.  Even if there is some minor use by
23     somebody else, minor use of generic brands or off
24     brands.  And the only testimony is that was very
25     occasional.  The vast majority was RJR.  That's what 3567
1     the evidence is.  It was RJR brands.  And you heard
2     that from Martha Schofield, and you heard that from
3     Ken Ellis, and heard that from Bernice Birdwell,
4     that she smoked Lucky Strikes when she started.
5     This is a nonissue that the defendants are trying to
6     make an issue of.  Their own stipulation -- their
7     own stipulation said that Philip Morris or Lorillard
8     smoking was minimal.
9          All right.  But even if there was some other
10     cause, the question you have to decide is was the
11     smoking of R.J. Reynolds one of the causes.  That's
12     all you have to decide.  It's a red herring to your
13     deliberations.
14          In order to be regarded as a legal cause of
15     death addiction to cigarettes need not be the only
16     cause.
17          You know, I comment for a minute about how
18     versatile R.J. Reynolds is.  Very versatile.  So
19     1999 in the Engle trial they argued that nicotine is
20     not addictive, and then once there was a finding,
21     that jury had to listen to testimony for a year and
22     had a finding.  They came back and said nicotine is
23     addictive.  R.J. Reynolds said, okay, nicotine is
24     addictive, but this person is not addicted.  Okay.
25     All right.  Maybe if Betty Owens is addicted -- 3568
1     well, if she is addicted, she didn't smoke because
2     of such addiction.  They're versatile.  They keep
3     moving it around, and we have to block them at every
4     turn.
5          The truth, ladies and gentlemen, is that Betty
6     Owens is a member of the class.  That's the truth.
7     She was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine.
8     She was part of the Engle class.  She's the reason
9     the Engle class was brought on behalf of this group
10     of people.  She is one of them.
11          That's what the evidence shows.  That's the
12     question you have on question 1 of the verdict form.
13     Was Betty Owens addicted to cigarettes containing
14     nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal
15     cause of her death?
16          The evidence is overwhelming she's a member of
17     this class.  So if she's a member of the class then
18     the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of the
19     Engle findings.  And what the court has instructed
20     you on is they can't deny them, they can't question
21     them, and the weight you give them is as if you had
22     decided them yourself.
23          And they are:  That cigarettes cause lung
24     cancer, that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.
25     These -- again, these are all in your jury 3569
1     instructions that you will have back with you.  That
2     R.J. Reynolds placed cigarettes on the market that
3     were defective and unreasonably dangerous.  The
4     product itself.  That R.J. Reynolds concealed or
5     omitted material information not otherwise known or
6     available.
7          And that's important.  That piece right there,
8     because the defendants are going to argue that Betty
9     Owens knew, she knew.  But the finding that you are
10     bound by says they concealed information that was
11     not otherwise known.  They hid things that people
12     didn't know, knowing that the material was false or
13     misleading, or failed to disclose a material fact
14     concerning the health effects or addictive nature of
15     smoking cigarettes, or both.
16          Five -- and this is the conspiracy where they
17     linked arms -- R.J. Reynolds agreed with other
18     tobacco companies to conceal or omit information
19     regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their
20     addictive nature with the intention --
21     intentionally, we talked about that -- intention
22     that smokers and the public would rely upon that
23     information to their detriment.
24          Rely.  Remember I put up -- Dr. Figlar said we
25     expect people to rely, and they should be able to 3570
1     rely.  It's our obligation.
2          They put out false information with the
3     intention that smokers and the public would rely to
4     their detriment.  And that R.J. Reynolds was
5     negligent.
6          These findings may not be denied or questioned.
7     They must carry the same weight they would have if
8     you had determined them yourselves.
9          All right.  So what's the second question that
10     you're going to be asked?  Second question on the
11     verdict form is the fraud question.  This is where
12     we start talking about their fraud.  This is it
13     right here.
14          State whether R.J. Reynolds' concealment or
15     omission of a material fact -- whether their
16     fraud -- about the health effects or addictive
17     nature of smoking cigarettes, or both, were a legal
18     cause of Betty Owens' death.  This is where we get
19     to the important stuff.  Whether their conspiracy,
20     the agreement to conceal or omit a material fact
21     regarding the health effects of cigarette smoking or
22     the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes was a
23     legal cause of Betty Owens' death.
24          The judge read to you what does that mean, that
25     their conspiracy, and their fraud was a legal cause. 3571
1     Well, it means reliance.  It's that word we have
2     been talking about.  This is from your jury
3     instructions.
4          The next issue for you to determine is whether
5     concealment or omission of material information
6     concerning the health effects or addictive nature of
7     cigarette smoking by R.J. Reynolds was a legal cause
8     of the death of Betty Owens.
9          Betty Owens' reliance on such statements to her
10     detriment is a legal cause of the loss, injury, or
11     damage if it directly and in continuous sequence
12     produces or contributes substantially to producing
13     her loss, injury, or damages, so that it can be
14     reasonably said that but for Betty Owens' reliance
15     on her loss, injury -- her loss, injury, or damage
16     would not have occurred.  All right.  Reliance.
17          And what the judge will instruct -- the judge
18     did instruct you is that when you're deciding that
19     issue you can consider all of the facts.
20          As to each of plaintiff's claims of concealment
21     and conspiracy to conceal I hereby instruct you that
22     you may consider all of the evidence in the case in
23     determining whether or not plaintiff has satisfied
24     the reliance question.
25          All right.  So this is a very simple concept. 3572
1     Okay.  Did their fraudulent conduct cause smoking?
2     Did all the stuff they do cause people to keep
3     smoking?  And did it cause Betty Owens to keep
4     smoking?
5          Remember how I said they want to believe that
6     it was victimless?  This is where you say no.  Your
7     fraud has victims, including Betty Owens.
8          What were the fraud messages that were put out?
9     We talked a lot about that.  The evidence that we
10     put up that defendant's fraud was a cause of Betty
11     Owens -- now, again it doesn't have to be the only
12     cause, but whether their fraud was a cause of Betty
13     Owens' death.  You have the Engle finding that says
14     that they concealed or omitted information that was
15     not otherwise known.  You have all of the statements
16     that they put out, and you'll have all these
17     documents back there, and you'll remember this whole
18     campaign, the Frank Statement, we believe the
19     products we make are not injurious to your health,
20     the campaign of doubt and denial.  You actually had
21     videotape that will go back with you that we played
22     in court from Howard Cullman, you'll remember, Bill
23     Dwyer, E. Horrigan from RJR, Ann Browder.  You
24     remember Ann Browder.  The testimony in front of
25     congress.  All that are the messages that they were 3573
1     putting out.  A campaign of doubt and denial.  The
2     press releases.  The entire Hill & Knowlton
3     campaign.  The white papers.  You remember the
4     distribution of the white papers, how many people it
5     was sent to.  Smoking and Health, the Continuing
6     Controversy.  How it was sent to all the doctors.
7          But in addition to all of this information
8     about this campaign of doubt and denial that was put
9     out -- that's the circulation of how many doctors
10     it was sent to.  205,000 copies of the white paper
11     was sent to doctors.  178,000 doctors.
12          They knew that they had to try and create
13     confidence and public assurance.  That was a Hill &
14     Knowlton document about how they were trying.  But
15     not just those messages.  The TI document, the TIRC
16     documents, which you also have, is their massive
17     advertising campaigns.
18          You'll recall Dr. Goldberg was on the stand for
19     two full days, and we talked about those messages
20     that the tobacco company was putting out, messages
21     that were determined to be false and misleading.
22          Cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed
23     products in the United States.  Between 1940 and
24     2005 U.S. cigarette manufacturers spent about 250
25     billion dollars on cigarette advertising and 3574
1     promotions.
2          Cigarette advertising reaches virtually all
3     Americans who can either read or understand the
4     spoken word.  The amount of cigarette advertising in
5     the United States is the most heavily advertised
6     product in America.  It has been estimated that the
7     six major cigarette companies spent more than one
8     billion dollars in 1980 to sell their product.  The
9     commission believes the warning label on the
10     cigarette package has not succeeded in overcoming
11     the prevalent attitude toward cigarette smoking
12     created and maintain by the cigarette companies
13     through their advertisements, particularly the
14     barrage of commercials on television which portray
15     smoking as a harmless and enjoyable social activity
16     that is not habit forming and involves no hazards to
17     health.
18          These false messages were being sent out to the
19     American public.
20          Can we play one of the ads now?  Play 121B-008.
21          (The video clip was played as follows.)
22          There's a wonderful world of softness, a
23     wonderful world of freshness.  It's the wonderful,
24     wonderful, wonderful, wonderful Salem cigarette.
25     Salem softness freshens your taste.  Salem softness 3575
1     freshens your taste.  Smoke Salem cigarettes.  Salem
2     gives you a modern filter plus rich tobacco taste,
3     smooth with menthol, softened with fresh air, for
4     Salem's special paper breathes in fresh air with
5     every puff to bring you Salems air-softened taste.
6     There's a wonderful world of softness, a wonderful
7     world of freshness.  It's the wonderful, wonderful,
8     wonderful world of Salem cigarettes.  Salem softness
9     freshens your taste.
10          (Video clip concluded.)
11          MS. SHAMP:  This is just one.  You'll have
12     plenty of those messages that we'll send back that
13     this is a harmless activity, that the filter filters
14     out the bad stuff.
15          And I use that particular ad because how it
16     shows fresh air, you're smoking fresh air with the
17     Salem cigarette.  These were false, misleading
18     advertisements.
19          And we know that Betty Owens watched
20     television.  We know she saw the commercials.  We
21     know that she bought and collected Belair coupons,
22     which were advertised.  We know, and the evidence
23     shows, that this massive advertising campaign
24     created more smoking.
25          What is the evidence of that?  The evidence 3576
1     that it created more smoking.  We put up the
2     evidence from Dr. Proctor who said that their
3     advertising campaign and the messages of doubt and
4     denial kept people smoking.  That's the evidence
5     that you have.  Dr. Goldberg said that the massive
6     advertising campaign created more smoking.
7          We also have Surgeon General reports, which we
8     read to you, which said that the advertising and the
9     messages of doubt and denial kept people smoking.
10          You'll also have the FTC reports which
11     showed -- and I showed some of them earlier -- that
12     people continued to smoke even after the Surgeon
13     General's report.
14          We also have RJR's internal documents.
15          Mike, bring up P976 at page 58.
16          The reason I'm putting these things up, they
17     put this message out, not into the ether, they
18     weren't putting this message out just for the heck
19     of spending billions of dollars.  They did it to
20     keep people smoking.  That's the causation.  They
21     did it to keep people smoking.
22          Bring up the top paragraph on that page.
23          The cigarette industry dramatically
24     demonstrates the force of advertising in the United
25     States today.  We have millions of individual 3577
1     purchases every day of the year, and every consumer
2     is pre-sold specifying his brand by name.  The rise
3     and fall of every brand of consequence has been
4     traced in detail, and their year-to-year success or
5     failure has shown to be the direct result of
6     consumer advertising.  People smoke because of the
7     advertising.
8          If you'll turn to Page 60, please, Michael.
9     Bring up conclusion 3.
10          The basic human motivation, the strongest of
11     which is the desire for security.  Hence the
12     compelling success of campaigns such as no throat
13     irritation, Camels never get on your nerves, et
14     cetera.  Contrary to popular belief, advertisers do
15     not instill fear into consumers to make them buy,
16     they simply recognize its existence and do their
17     best to profit by it.
18          Their advertising of filters.  People's fear.
19     And they profited by it.
20          Look at the final paragraph on that page,
21     Michael, please.
22          In every instance of vigorous aggressive
23     campaign presented with imagination and showmanship
24     has met with success regardless of copy theme media
25     or comparative size of appropriation. 3578
1          They're advertising what?  It created more
2     smoking.
3          Now, we also had in this case -- what is the
4     evidence that they presented that their fraud didn't
5     cause people to keep smoking?
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
[#DELETED RECESS#]
15          MS. SHAMP:  Thank you.
16          I think when we took our break we were
17     discussing Questions 2 and 3 on the verdict form,
18     that's the fraud and the conspiracy questions.  And
19     where I was talking about was what is the proof that
20     their fraud and conspiracy was a cause of Betty
21     Owens' death.
22          And again, we're going through the process of
23     weighing the evidence for each of the questions on
24     the verdict form.  Each of the questions on the
25     verdict form, what is the evidence that it was the 3587
1     cause of Betty Owens' death and what is the evidence
2     on the other side.
3          We went through a lot of trouble and put up a
4     lot of testimony and evidence about this.  We
5     brought in Dr. Proctor from Stanford University.
6     You will remember Dr. Proctor.  He was, I think, our
7     first witness that we put up.  Dr. Proctor from
8     Stanford talked about the history of the tobacco
9     industry and put up a lot of the industry's internal
10     documents.
11          We also put up Dr. Goldberg, and Dr. Goldberg
12     talked about the mass marketing campaigns.
13          We also put up the Surgeon General's reports,
14     various FTC reports, RJR's own internal documents.
15     We put up all of this evidence that their fraud was
16     a cause of Betty Owens' continued smoking and death.
17          I want to talk about one particular piece
18     because it relates specifically to Betty Owens.  The
19     judge will instruct you that you may use reason and
20     common sense to reach your conclusions.  And you can
21     draw reasonable inferences from the evidence.
22     Common sense and you can draw reasonable inferences.
23          Okay.  We put up evidence that showed that
24     smokers are more likely to have incorrect beliefs
25     about the relationship between smoking and lung 3588
1     cancer than are nonsmokers.
2          We believe the inference is that the
3     defendant's conduct, the advertising, the message
4     they put out of doubt worked, that smokers are more
5     likely to have incorrect beliefs about the
6     relationship between smoking and lung cancer than
7     nonsmokers.
8          We also gave you the National Enquirer.  All
9     right.  And it's very important that we put this in
10     context, all right?  And the context we gave you was
11     the testimony of Dr. Werner yesterday.  And you'll
12     remember what Dr. Werner said about denial and
13     addiction, all right.
14          I think if you asked any person on the street
15     who's a more reliable sort of information, the
16     National Enquirer or the Surgeon General.  I mean,
17     people on the street are going to say the Surgeon
18     General.  And what Dr. Werner talked about is how
19     denial factors into disease and the disease of
20     addiction.
21          And this was not news to R. J. Reynolds.  They
22     put this in the National Enquirer on purpose and in
23     True magazine.
24          Now, just enough -- and I asked Dr. Werner the
25     question, what -- how does this create an obstacle 3589
1     or barrier for somebody to quit?  And it's like a
2     crutch they hold.  R. J. Reynolds gave people the
3     crutch.  Why?  To keep selling cigarettes.  It's a
4     little crutch.  Sure, people are quitting.  We'll
5     talk a minute in about youth marketing.  And they're
6     trying to get new smokers for the ones that quit,
7     just give some of them a crutch.  That's why they
8     did this.
9          And the National Enquirer in particular, you
10     have evidence that she read the National Enquirer.
11     Read it.  You have evidence of that, that during
12     this time, this is 1968, that she read the National
13     Enquirer.
14          All right.  And that in conjunction with
15     Dr. Werner's testimony that information like this
16     was a barrier to people quitting.  That's evidence
17     of reliance that caused her disease.
18          But it's very personal, they'll have a very
19     different argument.  At first, before the Engle
20     trial, they argued that there was no fraud, no fraud
21     at all.  Now that they have the Engle findings, they
22     can't argue that.  Now they argue, well, our fraud
23     didn't cause Betty Owens to smoke.  Right?  It
24     didn't make any difference.  All of that fraud
25     didn't cause her to keep smoking. 3590
1          Ask yourself, what is the evidence of reliance?
2     We put up Dr. Proctor, Dr. Goldberg, Surgeon
3     General's reports, the FTC reports that their fraud
4     was a cause of Betty Owens' death and Dr. Werner.
5     What evidence did they put up that it wasn't?
6          We put up proof, you would expect them to
7     counter it.  The greater weight of the evidence,
8     Ladies and Gentlemen, we put up proof they didn't
9     counter.
10          Now, the second question on the verdict form:
11          State whether R. J. Reynolds' concealment or
12     omission of a material fact about the health effects
13     or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both
14     were a legal cause of Betty Owens' death.
15          The greater weight of the evidence shows it
16     was.  That their fraud -- the conspiracy count goes
17     hand in hand with the fraud count, all right?  The
18     first one is whether --
19          The third question on the verdict form:
20          State whether R. J. Reynolds' agreement to
21     conceal, that is, the conspiracy, the agreement to
22     conceal or omit a material fact regarding health
23     effects of cigarette smoke or the addictive nature
24     of smoking cigarettes was a legal cause of Betty
25     Owens' death.  The greater weight of the evidence 3591
1     says it was.
2          Now we move to question 4 on the verdict form.
3     And that's comparative fault question.  And this is
4     the one where we start talking about whether Betty
5     Owens didn't try hard enough to quit, what were her
6     efforts to quit, should she have tried harder,
7     should she have tried sooner.  And you have to
8     decide how much responsibility to put on R. J.
9     Reynolds and how much on Betty Owens.
10          So let's look at what the evidence is with
11     respect to these two parties' conduct because we
12     have to compare, right?  Let's compare.
13          R. J. Reynolds lied, we know that, with the
14     intent that smokers would rely, with the intent,
15     that's the finding, with the intent that smokers
16     would rely to their detriment.
17          And Dr. Figlar said it.  We expect people to
18     rely on us when we put out statements.  They said,
19     fortunately for us it's a habit they can't break.
20     I'll go through all of the evidence of the conduct
21     of R. J. Reynolds on this side, think about their
22     conduct and compare it to Betty Owens.
23          She started smoking when she was 13 years old.
24     And now Mr. Geise will say that she was making adult
25     decisions because she got married at 13.  I guess 3592
1     just because you make a decision doesn't necessarily
2     mean it's a good decision that you make.  13 years
3     old she started smoking.  That -- that choice she
4     made at 13.
5          Patches, medications, they weren't available.
6     There was an early cessation clinic, that's what the
7     testimony was.  There were very few things to help
8     somebody like Betty Owens to stop smoking.
9          So let's compare what they did, to what she
10     did.  She didn't try harder.  Compare that to their
11     intentional lies and deceit.  Compare what she did
12     when she was addicted buying their product, buying
13     their product, every day to what they did.
14          She was addicted.  That has to factor into your
15     consideration of choice.  What are the two choices
16     here that we're looking at?  The choice of a
17     13-year-old who then became addicted to their
18     product, not to try harder to quit when she became
19     an adult, but when you talk about choice, you can't
20     talk about choice without talking about informed
21     choice.
22          Sure, she made a choice, but did she know --
23     did they inform her about what was in their product?
24     Was it an informed choice that she made to continue
25     smoking, or because of their deceit, because of 3593
1     their lies did she continue to smoke, making that
2     choice.
3          Now, the defendants are very versatile, very
4     versatile.  So now they want to argue that it
5     doesn't matter about all these things, this was her
6     choice, she should be 100 percent at fault,
7     responsible, 100 percent at fault.
8          So, Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I'm not
9     going to tell you what I think the numbers should be
10     for the percentage of fault.  You are going to
11     assign some fault to Betty Owens.  That's okay.  But
12     we think the vast majority of fault has to go on
13     R. J. Reynolds, that when you compare the conduct of
14     R. J. Reynolds to that of our client's, the vast
15     majority has to be laid at their door given that the
16     evidence was that you heard about her smoking, given
17     what you heard.
18          Now, the next question that you reach, question
19     number 5, is damages.  And I want to talk for a
20     minute about what the evidence is with respect to
21     damages.  And there are two questions on the verdict
22     form about damages, question 5.  Two sections to
23     question 5.
24          One is the amount, if any, that Ken Ellis
25     sustained and then that Martha Schofield sustained. 3594
1     They're both on the verdict form as her two
2     children.  And, of course, Becky is deceased so
3     she's not on the verdict form.
4          So you heard the mortality tables.  25 years to
5     life was what her life expectancy was in '93.  She
6     died at 57.  25 years that Ken Ellis and Martha
7     Schofield lost the companionship of their mother.
8          Now, we go to work every day and we do our
9     jobs, we go about our business, but the value of our
10     life is really about our connections with the people
11     we love, our connections with our family.  That's
12     what makes our life really meaningful, makes it
13     important.  And so that relationship, I submit, is
14     an extraordinarily important and valuable
15     relationship, and for Ken and Martha, you heard the
16     testimony, she was their only parent.  She was the
17     only one they had.
18          So what -- 25 years lost of Christmases with
19     your mother, 25 years of Thanksgivings, birthday
20     parties, weddings, 25 years lost.  And I won't
21     represent to you that I'm an expert in knowing how
22     to put a value on something like that.  I'm going to
23     leave it to you, the collective consciousness of
24     you.  But there's some things that you ought to
25     think about. 3595
1          When you think about harm and the amount of
2     harm, and the amount of harm, the amount of loss,
3     I'd like to think that there are things that are
4     small harm, you break your arm, right?  And it's
5     small because it stops me from doing a couple of
6     things but it heals and it's better and after a
7     short time I'm going to be normal.
8          And then there's a group I call the medium
9     harms.  You hurt your back on your job and you're
10     out for a year and troubled, I call that a medium
11     harm, but eventually you get back.
12          Now talk about the harms that are large.  And
13     those are the ones that are permanent, that cause
14     pain and suffering that lasts, and I think you saw
15     the evidence of that on the stand with Martha and
16     with Ken.  This is a large harm.  It's a pain that
17     lasts, and it's life altering.
18          Now, it's very important to note what you write
19     on here really has nothing to do with what the other
20     evidence in the case is.  This is the -- the full
21     amount.  And the judge instructed you, that if you
22     reduce it, the percentages you put on the prior
23     question, they will be applied, but this has to be
24     the full amount.  So when you're looking at this
25     question, really just that question, what is the 3596
1     loss of Betty Owens' value to Ken Ellis and Martha
2     Schofield, what's the -- the full amount?  What's
3     the full amount of that loss?
4          It has two parts.  The first part is the pain
5     and suffering as a result of her injury and death.
6     And that's the pain watching her die.  And in this
7     case, that was pretty powerful.  Very powerful.
8     What is the total compensation for that loss?
9          And then the second part is the loss of his
10     parental companionship and instruction and guidance.
11     It's the same question for Martha and for Ken for
12     those two pieces.
13          And I'm going to let -- I'm not going to give
14     you a number.  I think the number that collectively
15     you believe would be the full amount of that loss,
16     that's good for us.
17          But let me suggest that one way of thinking
18     about it is to ask, because we live in a capitalist
19     society, we're capitalists here.  So what something
20     is worth is often what somebody would pay for it or
21     what you would give it up for.  Just ask yourself
22     what would you have to pay for somebody to say, I'll
23     give up 25 years with my mother, how much would you
24     have to pay somebody for them to raise their hand
25     and say, that's a good deal?  I'll take that deal. 3597
1          Of course, he wasn't given the choice to raise
2     his hand.  It's a large harm.
3          And the last question is punitive damages.  And
4     this is the part where you have to decide do they
5     get punished or do they get a pass.
6          And the stuff we have been talking about, their
7     conduct, their lies, their greed, their selfishness,
8     their profit motive, all of that goes into the
9     decision.  Under the circumstances, whether by clear
10     and convincing evidence, punitive damages are
11     warranted and the judge instructed you about that
12     and when those -- read those instructions, you have
13     to think, R. J. Reynolds.  The conduct causing loss
14     to the plaintiff was so gross and flagrant as to
15     show a reckless disregard for human life -- that's
16     R. J. Reynolds -- or the safety of persons exposed
17     to the effect.
18          Fortunately for us, our cancer-causing
19     cigarettes are a habit they can't break.
20          The conduct showed an entire lack of care that
21     R. J. Reynolds must have been consciously
22     indifferent to the consequences.
23          The conduct showed an entire lack of care that
24     R. J. Reynolds must have wantonly or recklessly
25     disregarded the safety and welfare of the public. 3598
1          Look at the Surgeon General's report.  The
2     conduct showed such reckless indifference of others
3     to be equivalent of an intentional violation of
4     those rights.  That's the evidence that we've built.
5     And you have to decide do they get punished, or do
6     you give them a pass?
7          And the judge will tell you that it's about
8     punishing them but also deterring this kind of
9     conduct, deterring it.
10          In determining whether punitive damages are
11     warranted, you may consider similar harms suffered
12     by other parties -- persons not parties to this
13     lawsuit in assessing the reprehensibility or
14     wrongfulness of R. J. Reynolds' acts as proven in
15     this case.
16          You can consider the amount of harm this
17     caused, 480,000 deaths every year, you can consider
18     that in determining if they should be punished, or
19     they get a pass.
20          So I don't want to talk again about all their
21     deceptions and lies.  I want to focus on two things
22     they did that I think are particularly egregious in
23     addition to what I talked about, and, that is, they
24     marketed this product who they knew would kill our
25     kids, to people whose brains were not developed yet, 3599
1     people's brains they could establish that addiction.
2     You saw those documents, those intentional documents
3     marketing it to 14-year-olds.
4          Manufacturers have studied the 14- to
5     20-year-old market.  Creating a fad in that market
6     is a bonanza.  A bonanza because you can addict
7     those kids and sell them cigarettes for the rest of
8     their lives until they die from your product.  A
9     bonanza.  This conduct has to be punished.
10          They talked about the -- the delicate,
11     sensitive nature of our kids and how to market their
12     product to tie into that.  The expected or
13     derived -- first, for the presmoker, those we
14     haven't got yet, and learn the physical effects of
15     smoking are largely unknown, unneeded or actually
16     quite unpleasant or awkward.
17          The expected or derived psychological effects
18     are largely responsible for influencing the
19     presmoker to try smoking and provide sufficient
20     motivation during the learning period to keep the
21     learner going despite the physical unpleasantness
22     and awkwardness.
23          And they targeted their marketing and their
24     products at our kids.
25          And this one probably is the -- one of the 3600
1     hardest to read.
2          It says that:  Finally, the older establishment
3     is preaching against smoking -- if the older
4     establishment is preaching against smoking, the
5     anti-establishment sentiment discussed above would
6     cause the young to be defiant and smoke, thus a new
7     brand aimed at the young group should not in any way
8     be promoted as a health brand and perhaps should
9     carry some implied risk.  In this sense, the warning
10     labels might actually be a plus for us.
11          They want kids to smoke.  Young kids.  They
12     want young kids to smoke.
13          We also have the Joe Camel, and we talked about
14     the Joe Camel.
15          Michael, if you will bring up P102A-194.
16          The evidence showed -- the evidence showed that
17     this type of advertising, smooth character appealed
18     to children and caused an increase in children's
19     smoking.  The Surgeon General's report talked about
20     it in the 1994 Surgeon General's report.
21          All right.  You can put that down.
22          Bring up 387-05.  The top paragraph.
23          Younger adult smokers are critical to RJR's
24     long-term performance and profitability.  Therefore,
25     RJR should make a substantial long-term commitment 3601
1     of manpower -- it's hard to read, but that says and
2     money -- dedicated to younger adult smokers
3     programs.  An unusually strong commitment from
4     executive management will be necessary, since major
5     volume payoffs may lag several years behind the
6     implementation of a successful younger adult smoker
7     strategy.
8          You'll remember -- I won't go through all the
9     documents that said what they defined as younger
10     adult was 14 to 20-year-olds.  It's document number
11     16, that's where they define the younger adult.
12          And the second thing I want to talk about is
13     manipulation of nicotine.
14          Now, they said they didn't add nicotine to
15     their product.  You remember that testimony?  What
16     the testimony is that they use the tobacco to blend
17     it so that they get the nicotine content they want
18     out of each cigarette.  All right.  They know that
19     the tobacco product is a vehicle for the delivery of
20     nicotine that they have to keep sufficient amounts
21     in there to supplier the smokers with necessary
22     requirements.  And then they did studies about how
23     do we manipulate the nicotine levels in our
24     cigarettes.
25          You saw a document, P681, Lucky 100 blend was 3602
1     treated with Compound W to increase to yield 2.85
2     nicotine, a 21 percent increase.
3          This is document P240:
4          Certainly the nicotine level of B&W, Brown &
5     Williamson, cigarettes given in the above table was
6     not obtained by accident.
7          They manipulate the nicotine level to keep
8     people addicted.
9          These are the additives that they put in their
10     product, including ammonia.  And we talked about
11     ammonia and how it increases the effect of nicotine
12     in the cigarettes.
13          You now today get to decide do they get
14     punished for their lies, for their greed, for their
15     fraud or their marketing of their products to our
16     kids, for manipulating the nicotine to keep people
17     addicted?  And then under clear and convincing
18     evidence, punitive damages have to be awarded in
19     this case.
20          Now, I suspect that the defendants will talk a
21     lot about Betty Owens in their closing, talk a lot
22     about Betty Owens.  They said in their opening that
23     she was street smart.  I think the evidence showed
24     that Betty Owens is our most vulnerable.  She is our
25     most vulnerable.  The ones they aim our products 3603
1     towards the ones with an eighth grade education
2     struggling to make a life for themselves and their
3     kids in America.  She is our most vulnerable, and
4     they want to blame her 100 percent.  That's who they
5     prey on, the eighth grade education, the working
6     people of our country, that's who they prey on.
7          They'll talk a lot about Betty Owens, and I
8     suspect that Mr. Geise will.  And when he does, I
9     want you to think what about RJR, talk about RJR.
10     They want to blame Betty Owens without accepting any
11     responsibility themselves.
12          I know you've listened to me for a long time.
13     Mr. Geise will get an opportunity to talk now, and
14     then I'll have a chance to come back and speak after
15     he does.  I thank you for your attention, and I
16     appreciate the opportunity to be able to present
17     this evidence to you.
18          Thank you.


16                REBUTTAL CLOSING ARGUMENT
17           MS. SHAMP:  Thank you.
18           Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  I know
19      that you are anxious to start deliberating, so I am
20      not going to speak for very long.  I took a lot of
21      notes, responses to some of the things Mr. Geise
22      said, and I'm not going to go through all of them.
23           You've heard all the evidence and you've heard
24      argument from both of us.  And now it's time for
25      you to go back there and make decisions based on 3721
1      what the evidence is that you heard.
2           I do want to touch on a few things that he
3      said just to point out some things that I think
4      were not correct or that there was more to the
5      story.  He mentioned the Flinstones and how we
6      hadn't told the whole story.  I think if you
7      remember what the evidence was with respect to the
8      Flinstones, we told you specifically it was a prime
9      time show, and then we had Dr. Goldberg talk about
10      the number of children who watch prime time shows.
11      And that that, in addition to the fact that
12      children associated cartoon characters with
13      increased smoking and there was testimony about
14      that.
15           But I also wanted to draw your attention to
16      something else, and that is Exhibit 243.
17           You'll remember that both Mr. Ellis and
18      Ms. Schofield said that they watched both Gun Smoke
19      and Wagon Train, and Exhibit 243 is what
20      Dr. Goldberg put up during his testimony, which
21      showed the shows that were sponsored in 1963 by the
22      tobacco industry.  And if you look there, both Gun
23      Smoke and -- Gun Smoke is on Saturday at
24      10:00 o'clock, and they watched Gun Smoke, and
25      Wagon Train on the top part, there is it, Monday, 3722
1      which was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds, and that
2      started at 8:30 at night.
3           And so the evidence is that they were watching
4      shows at night that were sponsored by R.J. Reynolds
5      or R.J. Reynolds' predecessor in interest.
6           Mr. Geise said one thing I caught really
7      quickly.  And he said this, he said, Any addiction
8      she had didn't cause her smoking.  You remember he
9      said that.  I think that sounds like he admits, of
10      course, that she did have an addiction, that she
11      was addicted, and that is of course Question 1 on
12      the verdict form.
13           Yeah, he talked about Dr. Wright and you'll
14      remember that Dr. Wright did give a lot of
15      testimony because Dr. Wright was, in fact, the
16      chief medical examiner in Miami Dade County, and he
17      talked about the amount of testimony he gives
18      because he's the called in as the medical examiner
19      and what his expertise is in determining cause of
20      death.
21           And that's what he came in and told you was
22      the cause of death.  And he told you that the cause
23      of death was lung cancer caused by smoking
24      cigarettes.  I'm not going to go through all of the
25      lung cancer, I don't really think that's an issue 3723
1      in this case.  She had lung cancer, it was caused
2      by cigarette smoking.  You can look at Exhibits 4
3      and 5.  Those are the medical records.  They show
4      over and over again that she had lung cancer, that
5      she had lung cancer diagnosed in several different
6      ways, that she had lung cancer diagnosed at least
7      three times by biopsy or by bronchoscopy.
8           And I want to touch on the thing about what
9      the percentage is of the addiction today that was
10      listed in the new -- the brand new DSM V.  And you
11      heard the testimony about that.  The DSM V it's a
12      50 percent, but in the DSM IV TR before that it was
13      80 to 90 percent, and we talked about that little
14      bit.
15           And then it's very likely that the percentage
16      of addicted smokers now is less than it was in 1993
17      and that's because we really changed --
18      fortunately, the public health community has really
19      changed smoking behavior by limiting the places
20      that people can smoke.
21           It is very difficult for a person to smoke
22      throughout the day anymore if they're employed.  It
23      is very difficult for them to smoke in just about
24      any public place.  So that is forcing smokers to
25      cut back and cut back and cut back, and I just 3724
1      wanted to point that out.
2           I think the evidence is that in 1993, and
3      certainly in 1960, '70, '80 when Ms. Owens was
4      alive and smoking, that the prevalence of nicotine
5      addiction was 80 to 90 percent of regular smokers.
6           I also want to mention this idea about
7      relaxation and remind you about Dr. Werner's
8      testimony, that what happens when addicted smokers
9      goes without nicotine, when the nicotine substance
10      is withdrawn, that it causes the brain to go out of
11      balance, caused them to go out of equilibrium and
12      that feels bad, feels bad.
13           So that when they smoke and they tell people
14      it relaxes them, it's because their body is going
15      back to equilibrium.  And so a report -- and
16      Dr. Werner testified to this -- of feeling relaxed
17      or calm or enjoying smoking is a feeling of going
18      back to equilibrium when an addicted smoker's body
19      has gone out of equilibrium because the nicotine
20      has been withdrawn.
21           It's interesting, Mr. Geise talked a lot about
22      the different choices that Betty Owens made and
23      whether she had tried hard enough to quit smoking.
24      But you will have the verdict form and that's not
25      on the verdict form, whether she tried hard enough. 3725
1      The question is whether she was addicted, that's
2      the question that you have to answer.
3           And again, he mentioned -- and I thought it
4      was a strange argument to make in 2014, but
5      Mr. Geise said that in America that teenagers who
6      have children are mature enough to make that
7      decision.  I think that's a strange argument to
8      make, that a teenager who has to -- a child is
9      mature enough to make those choices.  I think the
10      evidence that you heard is that the 13-year-old, a
11      15-year-old, brains are not fully developed when
12      she became a regular smoker.
13           Another argument that he made -- and he showed
14      you a lot about the information that's publically
15      available, that there was information that the
16      Surgeon General had said and various other people,
17      and he put up some articles from a long time ago
18      that people knew the hazards associated with
19      smoking, everybody knew because these people were
20      making these statements in the Reader's Digest, et
21      cetera.
22           Well, look at your jury instructions.  Because
23      the jury instructions say that the defendant is not
24      entitled to question or challenge the Engle
25      findings.  And what the Engle findings show -- pull 3726
1      up Finding 4 for me, please.
2           The Engle findings show that R.J. Reynolds
3      concealed or omitted material information that was
4      not otherwise known.  What they withheld are things
5      the public didn't know and they're not allowed to
6      challenge that.  That is established in this case
7      once you've established class membership.
8           Mr. Geise talked about the issue of reliance,
9      and it is an important point.  I want to just
10      remind the Court -- remind the jury about the
11      testimony of Dr. Figlar that said it's -- that R.J.
12      Reynolds' customers both can and should rely upon
13      their statements and that they had an obligation to
14      tell the truth.
15           And essentially what the defendant is arguing
16      is, is that it doesn't matter.  Their argument is
17      it just doesn't matter that we didn't tell people
18      what we knew.  That's their argument that it
19      doesn't matter.  Even though they admit that
20      they're the ones that have to know about their
21      product, that they have to disclose what they know
22      about their product.
23           Mr. Geise talked about Jacksonville being the
24      city of -- the River City and the bridges and that
25      there is no bridge.  But Mr. Geise can't get around 3727
1      the bridge that is the National Enquirer.  The
2      evidence shows that the National Enquirer was
3      written by Stanley Frank -- this article was
4      written by Stanley Frank, who was an employee of
5      Hill & Knowlton, and that the activities of Hill &
6      Knowlton were directed by the TIRC and Dr. Figlar
7      testified that anything the TIRC did was approved
8      by R.J. Reynolds.
9           All right.  So this article is approved by
10      R.J. Reynolds, okay?  A statement by them in a
11      paper she read regularly.
12           That is a bridge.  It's a bridge between their
13      conduct and Betty Owens.  It's just one of the
14      bridges, but that is a bridge that they can't
15      ignore.
16           As the Court will instruct you, you have the
17      ability to make inferences from the facts and the
18      facts that are presented when she was a regular
19      reader of the National Enquirer.
20           The evidence is also that during the 1950s and
21      '60s almost everybody switched to filters because
22      the public perceived that they were safer.  And
23      you'll have Exhibit 977, which discusses that
24      specifically, that the defendants were falsely
25      advertising filtered cigarettes and it created a 3728
1      public perception that they were safer.
2           We talked about the coupons.  And the reason
3      we put in the coupons and we showed you the coupons
4      is -- and we also showed you the advertisements,
5      that the coupons were on Belairs.  Those are
6      cigarettes manufactured by the defendant and they
7      promoted the Belair cigarettes.  And we showed you
8      some of the advertisements for Belair where it said
9      cleaner smoking and had the couple in the window
10      with the snow falling behind them, that was a
11      Belair advertisement, and it connects Betty Owens
12      to R.J. Reynolds advertising.  The coupons connect
13      them together.  All right.
14           And I hope I don't want to belabor this again
15      because I was surprised when Mr. Geise said that we
16      had to somehow tape something together with respect
17      to the Charles Golden writing this -- the National
18      Enquirer story.  We had to tape it together because
19      the defendants left you with the impression --
20      until we came in and brought you that FTC report,
21      they left you with the impression that Charles
22      Golden had written something previously and he was
23      a real person.
24           And what Proctor said and what Goldberg said,
25      which was absolutely true, he was not a real 3729
1      person.  It was the employee of Hill & Knowlton,
2      Stanley Frank, who wrote that.
3           Again, I think you know what the evidence is
4      that all of the brands, Lucky, Winston, Belair,
5      Camel, Kool, Salem, all brands manufactured by R.J.
6      Reynolds, there's a stipulation to that effect, and
7      the brands that were manufactured by either Philip
8      Morris or Lorillard did not contribute or cause
9      injury in this case.
10           So finally, I want to touch on punitive
11      damages because Mr. Geise spent some time talking
12      about punitive damages.  And what he said was --
13      and he said it several times, was that Mr. Ellis,
14      if you get to that portion of the verdict form,
15      Mr. Ellis would have already been fully
16      compensated.
17           And that's because that section on the verdict
18      form which talks about the full amount should be
19      written in that section.  All right.  So when you
20      get to this section of punitive damages, Mr. Geise
21      was saying that Mr. Ellis had already been
22      compensated.
23           You'll remember in voir dire, I asked that
24      question.  I said that at the end of the case we
25      will ask for punitive damages and punitive damages 3730
1      go to the plaintiff, but that should play no role,
2      no role in your determination as to whether
3      punitive damages are warranted.  Where they go
4      should play no role.  All right.
5           The question and the only question is whether
6      R.J. Reynolds' conduct merits being punished and
7      whether you feel like -- that they need to be
8      deterred.  That's the only question.  And whether
9      or not he has been fully compensated should play no
10      role in your decision as to whether to award
11      punitive damages and whether plaintiff is entitled
12      to punitive damages.
13           I want to bring up 287 because I think
14      Mr. Geise talked about the new R.J. Reynolds, a
15      different company.  And I started my closing
16      argument with this document, the document which
17      shows that if -- I think -- sorry, "Once it becomes
18      clear that such action is necessary for the
19      successful defense of our present and future suits,
20      we will promptly remove all such documents from our
21      files."
22           Mr. Geise relied upon Dr. Figlar's testimony
23      to say it was a new and improved R.J. Reynolds so
24      that you don't have to punish them.  But is that
25      really what R.J. Reynolds -- what the testimony was 3731
1      from Dr. Figlar?  The evidence is about all those
2      changes is right here.  It's in the 2010 Surgeon
3      General's Report.  All of those changes that they
4      talked about, unfortunately -- unfortunately, we
5      find out that the public health community is always
6      a step behind R.J. Reynolds.
7           They'll say things.  And then we find out a
8      step behind that what they're doing is, in fact,
9      not what they say, that it's not aiding the public
10      health and that's consistent.
11           You remember I asked him about Snus and he got
12      all angry about that because the public health
13      community said that that is actually a --
14      contributing to young people smoking, initiation of
15      tobacco use.  You remember on their website, they
16      say that nicotine is not harmful and yet the
17      Surgeon General says, in fact, that nicotine harms
18      the fetus.  It harms the brain of young people who
19      are smoking.  Nicotine itself.
20           We're always a step behind them, including the
21      2010 Surgeon General's Report where it says, "At
22      the same time tobacco company documents all are so
23      clearly demonstrate that the industry understood
24      that smokers would not achieve the claimed
25      deliveries because of smoker compensation.  In 3732
1      contrast to industry awareness, the various ways
2      that cigarettes were physically modified and the
3      nature and level of compensation in response to
4      design changes were not well understood by the
5      parties outside of the tobacco industry itself.
6           "Public health officials have little basis to
7      anticipate the degree to which manufacturers could
8      design cigarettes to allow the smoker to draw more
9      smoke and nicotine from cigarettes than was
10      represented by the machine-measured yields of tar
11      and nicotine."
12           We're always a step behind.  They have not
13      made changes to make their product safe.
14           The question you have to ask, based on all the
15      evidence you've heard, is whether you punish them
16      or you give them a pass.
17           Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for
18      your service, and I want to thank you on behalf of
19      myself and my team and my client.  But I want to
20      make it very clear that the service you provide is
21      not to us.  It is not to me or my client or even to
22      R.J. Reynolds.  The service you provide, by sitting
23      in this jury, is a service to this country and to
24      this community and to our society.
25           And the decision you make, based upon the 3733
1      evidence you have heard in this case, is important
2      to all of those people.  And how you respond to
3      that evidence, how you respond to the evidence
4      you've heard, is important to our community, to our
5      country, to our society.
6           Ladies and gentlemen, the word "verdict" means
7      to speak the truth.  "Ver," it's from veritas,
8      which means true, and dict from dictaphone or
9      dictate, means speak.  What it means is speak the
10      truth.  And so we ask you when you go back in that
11      jury room to render a verdict that speaks the truth
12      in this case.
13           Thank you so much.
