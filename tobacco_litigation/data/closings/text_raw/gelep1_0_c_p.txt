3                MR. ACOSTA:  Yes, I do, Your Honor.  Thank
4           you very much.
5                Good afternoon.  And I want to thank you,
6           first of all, for your service here and your
7           patience with us for this lengthy Phase One.  8                Phase two is going to depend on how you
9           answer the question that is before you to be
10           answered in Phase One.  And Phase Two would be
11           very short.  I can't tell you exactly how long it
12           would be, but I think it would be really short --
13           very short, because a lot of the evidence that you
14           heard is evidence that may not actually apply to
15           the question that you've got to answer here in
16           Phase One.  And it would carry over, and then you
17           would consider that in Phase Two.  For example,
18           the brand of smoke -- the brands that were smoked
19           is not relevant to the question you have to
20           answer.
21                And this is the question that you have to
22           answer in this phase of the trial.  This is the
23           verdict.  And the question is, "Was Alexander
24           Gelep addicted to cigarettes that contained
25           nicotine and, if so, was such addiction a legal  5
1           cause of the primary lung cancer and his death?"
2           Yes or no?
3                So that's what this first phase has actually
4           been about, is to have you answer that question.
5           And I'll show it to you one more time before I sit
6           down.
7                You'll remember back in the opening, I said
8           that there were a number of things that we hoped
9           the evidence would show.  You know, when you make
10           an opening and you tell juries what you think the 11           evidence things will show -- as the judge told
12           you, what we said then wasn't the evidence.  What
13           was the evidence is what you actually saw, and
14           it's -- it's not always exactly the same.  We
15           can't predict with 100 percent accuracy exactly
16           what's going to come into evidence and what's not
17           going to come into evidence and so forth.
18                So -- but there were a lot of things that we
19           did show you in the opening that we showed you in
20           evidence during this part of the trial.
21                One of them was how much Mr. Gelep smoked.
22           And if you recall, I had this board up previously.
23           And he smoked up to 60 cigarettes a day.  That's a
24           tremendous amount of smoking by any measure.  One
25           of the records said that he smoked three packs a  6
1           day for 45 years.  And you probably remember
2           there's a lot of discrepancies, but by anybody's
3           measure, Mr. Gelep was a heavy cigarette smoker.
4           In fact, a couple of the records which are going
5           to be going back with you into the jury room --
6           this big binder is filled with his records, and
7           they document his smoking history together with
8           this board here.
9                And these are photos that were introduced
10           into evidence.  They're in this envelope that will
11           go back with you.  And you can see what we did is
12           we put the dates on those that Mr. Gelep dated or
13           on those where the date was on the back of the
14           photograph.  And, you know, here he is goofing 15           around.
16                What we tried to do is to put these in an
17           order from youngest to oldest.  And you can -- in
18           every single one of these pictures, he's either
19           holding a cigarette or has a pack of cigarettes or
20           smoking a cigarette.  I think one of them might
21           show that he had an ashtray sitting next to him,
22           this one right here with his daughter.
23                And you can see that -- you can see him grow
24           older.  You know, every few years, there's a
25           picture of him smoking a cigarette or with a  7
1           cigarette from the earliest to the latest.
2                This was a man that needed to have a
3           cigarette with him basically all the time.  60
4           cigarettes a day is a cigarette every 10 or
5           15 minutes.  So he was always with a cigarette.
6           And this chronicles, you know, the years.  So you
7           can see it was pretty much continuous smoking back
8           from the time he had his first cigarette in his
9           mouth.  And if you look closely, you can see this
10           one is lit.  I think Mr. Gelep testified he didn't
11           see that, but if you look closely, you can see
12           there's about a half, a quarter-inch of ash on
13           that one.
14                We must prove our case by the greater weight
15           of the evidence.  And you'll be getting a short
16           instruction on that.  And, you know, lawyers, 17           they -- oftentimes they stand up and they -- they
18           weigh the scales and they say, you know, just a
19           grain of sand is enough to tip the scales.  Well,
20           that's true.  All we have to do is win by the
21           greater weight, which doesn't have to be a big
22           weight.  It can be a very small weight.  But
23           you're the ones who decide what that is.  So it's
24           not beyond a reasonable doubt.  That's what you do
25           in a criminal case where somebody goes to jail.  8
1           This is different.  This is different.  If we win
2           by 51 to 49, we win.
3                So when you're looking at this evidence,
4           perhaps you should be thinking in terms of, well,
5           what's more probable?  Is the evidence that was
6           presented by the plaintiff in the case more
7           probably true or not?  If you don't think it's
8           probable that Mr. Gelep was addicted to smoking as
9           much as he did, if you don't think that's
10           probable, then we would lose.  If you think it's
11           probable that he had an addiction to nicotine,
12           which we think the evidence is pretty much
13           overwhelming that he was -- and I'll explain that
14           a little bit further in a minute, that he had an
15           addiction to nicotine and that it was a cause --
16           if you remember on this verdict form -- I guess I
17           didn't point this out, but it's a cause -- a legal
18           cause of his primary cancer and death.
19                So I'm going to talk a little bit about his 20           addiction, I'm going to talk a little bit about
21           his lung cancer, and then I'm going to talk a
22           little bit about how the two fit together.
23                One of the things that we did when we started
24           out in our opening is we put up this board here.
25           And this board, you know, is to show the different  9
1           reasons why people smoke.  And Dr. Groff talked
2           about that.  And I think Dr. Cummings -- you might
3           remember him -- he talked about some of these
4           things, too.  The one thing that exists, underlies
5           all these other things is addiction.  That's the
6           thing that drives smoking.
7                The defendants in the case have come out and,
8           as I mentioned in the opening, they deny
9           everything.  They deny addiction.  They deny it
10           was lung cancer.  They deny the addiction was one
11           of the causes of the lung cancer.  And, you know,
12           in their world, the seller goes free and the
13           person that uses the drug gets addicted and dies,
14           pays the price.  And that's the way these
15           defendants have done business.  They --
16                MS. PARKER:  Objection, Your Honor.
17                THE COURT:  Do you need to approach the
18           bench?
19                (The following proceedings took place at
20           sidebar:)
21                MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I don't see how
22           the way the defendants approach business is 23           relevant to the question that we're talking about
24           here.  If he wants to talk about Mr. Gelep's
25           addiction or addiction in general, that's one 10
1           thing.  But I think this is out of balance given
2           the issue in the case.
3                MR. ACOSTA:  There was certainly evidence of
4           it through Dr. Farone as to how they approach
5           business and what they do and how they do it, and
6           I think it is relevant.  It goes to the choice
7           issue.
8                And, you know, I'm just arguing from the
9           evidence that's in the record.  I don't see
10           anything wrong with that, Judge.  There certainly
11           wasn't anything wrong with that question.
12                MS. PARKER:  Company conduct should not be an
13           issue in Phase One.  We object under that basis.
14                THE COURT:  Well, it is involved in Phase One
15           to the extent that the company knows and admits
16           and is involved in the use of an addictive
17           substance in their product.  So to the limited
18           extent that he touches on it in that way, it
19           doesn't appear to be fault-based argument.  So
20           I'll permit a very limited discussion.
21                MS. PARKER:  And we can respond in our
22           closing?
23                THE COURT:  Okay.
24                (Sidebar conference concluded.)
25                THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you, Counsel.
EXCERPT - CLOSING STATEMENTS 3-24-09 11
1                MR. ACOSTA:  May I proceed, Your Honor?
2                THE COURT:  Yes.
3                MR. ACOSTA:  So these cigarette company
4           defendants, they're the seller.  They're the
5           seller and Mr. Gelep was the buyer.  And they did
6           things to their product.  They did things to
7           cigarettes on purpose, deliberate.  It wasn't an
8           accident.  It isn't just a natural product, you
9           know, some leaf that contains nicotine, there's a
10           lot more to it.  And we showed that through
11           Dr. Farone and through some of the documents that
12           I've got.
13                But the proof of addiction not only comes
14           from some common sense because of the amount of
15           cigarettes that he smoked and what he tried to do
16           to stop, but you heard Dr. Groff.  He was our
17           first witness.  He was the man with the white
18           hair.  He was the psychiatrist who met with the
19           family and interviewed them, reviewed materials,
20           and came to the conclusion that Mr. Gelep was
21           addicted.
22                Dr. Goldman, who is the chairman of the
23           Department of Internal Medicine at the USF Medical
24           School, who has treated thousands of smokers, you
25           know, has been in the Tampa Bay area since the 12 early 1970s, works at the VA hospital where there
2           have been thousands of smokers on ailments, knows
3           that Mr. Gelep was addicted to nicotine and
4           cigarettes.  He reviewed all the medical records.
5           He knows what smokers goes through.  He knows how
6           hard it is to get smokers to refrain from
7           continuing to smoke.
8                Then we had Dr. Cummings who came down from
9           the Roswell Park Cancer Institute up in Buffalo
10           who runs clinics -- tobacco control clinics.  He's
11           a public health doctor, a Ph.D., who said that
12           Mr. Gelep was highly addicted.
13                These are people that deal with this issue
14           every day.  Dr. Groff doesn't do it anymore
15           because he's retired now, but Dr. Goldman and
16           Dr. Cummings deal with it every single day.  So
17           they felt that he was addicted.  And even
18           Dr. Hansen, who was his family treating
19           physician -- he came in.  You might remember him.
20           He was kind of quiet.  He also felt that Mr. Gelep
21           was addicted.
22                And, you know, you might remember that
23           Mr. Gelep, toward the end of his smoking, told
24           Dr. Hansen that, you know, he didn't want to cut
25           back.  He had -- he had cut back and actually quit 13
1           a few years earlier in 1987 and then had gained
2           weight and then started smoking again.  That's in
3           the medical records that you were shown.  4                And then he -- he was smoking some.  There's
5           a record that says, I guess, in 1992 that he was
6           smoking some.  But then by 1994, he is up to two
7           and a half packs a day.  This is a resigned
8           smoker, somebody that had smoked and smoked and
9           tried and tried and was unable to stop.
10                You might remember that, you know, there were
11           questions asked about some of the witnesses from
12           this book, the DSM-IV.  There were questions asked
13           from the 1988 surgeon general's report, which for
14           some reason isn't in there, but that -- those
15           reports -- the surgeon general's report was all
16           about addiction.  And the witness that the defense
17           put on was asked some questions about addiction
18           and how it influences the choices that smokers
19           make.  It impairs their choice.  You know, that's
20           what an addiction is.
21                The -- you know, the statistics about
22           addicted smokers are pretty incredible.  We're
23           talking about 15 million people every year that
24           try to stop, and only 3 to 5 percent are
25           successful in that year to stay off cigarettes for 14
1           a year.  That's a pretty -- pretty rough
2           statistic.  And you might remember in this book,
3           the DSM-IV, you know, indicated that 45 percent
4           were able to quit, implying that 55 percent are
5           unable to quit -- 55 percent are unable to quit.
6                I think you saw this record briefly on the  7           screen.  It's an R.J. Reynolds record dated 1982.
8           And in this particular record, it indicates that
9           most of the people that smoke would like to stop.
10           You know, most of those who have for any
11           significant time smoked would like to stop.
12           That's what it says right here.  But many -- but
13           not most of those who would like to stop smoking
14           are able to do so.  So R.J. Reynolds recognized
15           that most smokers were unable to stop.
16                There are other records that you'll get to
17           take back with you.  Here's one in 1959 from
18           Philip Morris.  It's called "Psychological
19           Research."  Even back then, the number three
20           reason that they thought people smoked was
21           addiction.
22                You were shown this record from Philip Morris
23           in 1990.  And, again, this is going back with you.
24           This is one of those that says, All forms of
25           nicotine are not behaviorally or psychologically 15
1           equal.
2                Remember we talked about free basing the
3           nicotine and what the cigarette companies do to do
4           that?  Well, we have another record in here which
5           you could look at.  It's an R.J. Reynolds record.
6           And this supports exactly what Dr. Farone told
7           you.  As the pH goes up, as they change the pH,
8           you get more free-based nicotine.  See, they don't
9           do that for nothing. 10                Here's another Reynolds record.  The title of
11           it, "The Nature of the Tobacco Business and the
12           Crucial Role of Nicotine."  Here's one that
13           Dr. Farone discussed, "Motives and Incentives in
14           Cigarette Smoking."
15                You can look through these back in the jury
16           room.  They're just something that you can look at
17           to verify what -- verify this other evidence that
18           you've been told.  You know, this is basically
19           like -- it's worse than that.  It's worse than
20           this.  It's worse than the fraternity guy that
21           spikes the punch bowl with grain.  You know, it's
22           worse than that.  This is killing people, and it
23           killed Mr. Gelep.
24                MS. PARKER:  Objection, Your Honor.
25                MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor. 16
1                MS. PARKER:  Same objection.
2                THE COURT:  Same ruling.
3                MR. ACOSTA:  Dr. Farone talked to you about
4           some of the things that the cigarette companies do
5           to make cigarettes more addictive.  They put
6           ammonia in them.  They put acid aldehyde in them,
7           a chemical.  They put the chemical urea in
8           cigarettes.  They put licorice in them.  They put
9           cocoa shells in them.  They all have a purpose,
10           and that purpose is to addict the smoker.
11                These are choices.  We talked about choices.
12           And the defense is, well, Mr. Gelep had a choice, 13           had a choice to, you know, stop smoking whenever
14           he wanted to.  You know, he was finally able to do
15           it when he was sick with a -- what he thought was
16           an upper respiratory infection, it turned out to
17           be a big tumor in his lung.  And he was very sick.
18           And then he goes on chemo, he's losing weight.
19           He -- if you look at those records, you'll see he
20           lost about 40 pounds from somewhere around 168
21           down to somewhere around 130.
22                Eventually he had to go on oxygen.  You'll
23           see in there that sometime in late spring, early
24           summer he's on oxygen.  He had radiation.  He had
25           chemo.  He was sick.  He was sick. 17
1                So we do have some records that suggest that,
2           you know, maybe -- maybe he didn't quit in '95 or
3           early '96.  The family doesn't remember him
4           smoking after that, but there's a couple records
5           that make you wonder whether he was still smoking
6           or not.  One near the very end said he quit just
7           recently.  Now, does that mean nine months ago or
8           does that mean a few weeks ago?  That was -- that
9           was dated in October of '96.
10                And there was one where it said he was --
11           he's a smoker.  And it was done in present tense.
12           And I think that was in February.  In fact, it may
13           have been the one up at Sloan-Kettering.
14                We talked about Dr. Farone a little bit, and
15           so I want to show you some of the things that 16           Dr. Farone -- I just basically paraphrased these
17           things from the information we have.  But
18           Dr. Farone said:
19                "Was one of your understandings at Philip
20           Morris that the addiction to cigarettes altered
21           the ability of the smoker to make choices about
22           whether to continue smoking or not?"
23                "Of course it did."
24                "From your conversations with Philip Morris
25           executives and scientists, did these executives, 18
1           the vice president, and the president, the CEO,
2           and other scientists from principal scientists on
3           up believe that nicotine was a highly addictive
4           drug back then when you were there?"
5                "Certainly."
6                "Did they accept the idea that the addiction
7           would cause Philip Morris to sell more
8           cigarettes?"
9                "Yeah.  In my opinion they did, yes.  That's
10           why they kept it there, otherwise they would take
11           it out a long time ago" -- the nicotine.
12                "Are those additives put into cigarettes by
13           the cigarette companies for that purpose, to
14           enhance the addictive nature of smoking?"
15                "In my opinion, yes."
16                "Was urea added for that purpose, to
17           free-base the nicotine?"
18                "Yeah.  They didn't need it for any other 19           purpose, so yes."
20                "Was it thought at Philip Morris that
21           addiction was the reason people smoked?"
22                "Yes."
23                "And why is that important?"
24                "Because it indicates the rationale behind
25           the use of ammonia and other chemicals that raise 19
1           the pH and accelerate the delivery of free-based
2           nicotine."
3                "And does that pertain to the addictive
4           nature of smoking?"
5                "In my opinion, it does."
6                "Did you have an understanding as to whether
7           or not the addiction affected the free will of the
8           smoker?"
9                "Addiction always affects free will.  I mean,
10           yes.  An addiction is just what it says.  It's
11           something that decreases your ability to stop
12           doing that which you are addicted to."
13                He was the one that was on the video.  I
14           probably should have said that first.  But that's
15           who those quotes were from, was that fellow who
16           was on the video that we had the technical
17           problems with a week ago Monday.
18                Now, one thing to consider is that Mr. Gelep
19           smoked for many years before the warning -- you
20           know, for many years.  No matter when you think --
21           no matter when you think this picture was taken, 22           he smoked for a long time.  And so when the
23           warnings came out -- the first one is the caution
24           label, and then the second one is the warning.
25           And his son Paul is on him, you know.  Paul says, 20
1           you know, "Look, Dad, you've got to quit."  And
2           they would confront over it.
3                And finally in 1974, we know -- and I'm not
4           trying to skip over this.  We know that he had
5           cancer of the kidney in 1970.  The only testimony
6           about that came from Mary Gelep, who you heard
7           about.  And when I confronted the defense witness
8           with the actual language in her deposition, which
9           is what he relied on, it was obvious that she did
10           not remember and was confused and did not know
11           whether he was talking about 1996 or 1970.  And
12           she said that.
13                So aside from 1970, in 1974, Paul is going to
14           Duke.  And they're playing the University of
15           Florida football team for homecoming, and he comes
16           down and meets his mom and dad up there for the
17           game, and dad's not smoking.  I think he said it
18           was a Friday night to Sunday morning or something
19           like that.  But for a full day, his dad wasn't
20           smoking.  They left, Paul goes home at Christmas,
21           and his dad is smoking again.
22                His brother John, he was the one with the
23           mustache.  You might remember he said that his dad
24           told him he couldn't quit.  And that was about 25           that same time frame. 21
1                So somebody tells you they can't quit, what
2           are they telling you?  There's no evidence that he
3           knew it was addictive.  He just said, I can't
4           quit.
5                Then we -- you know, we're left with only the
6           recollections of the family.  And they were
7           different when they lived at home in the later
8           years at different times.  And we don't know if
9           Mr. Gelep tried to quit, who knows when?  There's
10           just no evidence of it because nobody can
11           remember, you know, family history that well.
12                We do know that he certainly was smoking all
13           the time, but we also know that when Paul had a
14           baby in 1987, his first son, who he named Alex
15           after his dad, he writes a letter.  He writes a
16           letter to his dad as if he is his baby.  You know,
17           Dear Dad, you know, I really want to be around you
18           as you -- you know, as I grow older so you can,
19           you know, do things with me and so on and so
20           forth.  It was a letter to get his father to try
21           again to quit smoking.
22                And Mr. Gelep was able to stay off cigarettes
23           for some period of time, maybe up to six months.
24           Nobody knows exactly for sure.  But we do know
25           that it was long enough for him to gain some 22 weight, and some significant weight, because the
2           medical record the next year indicates that he
3           feels better -- feels better now that he's
4           smoking.  So he wasn't feeling good when he didn't
5           smoke.
6                Of course, that's one of the symptoms of
7           addiction.  You know, smoking in the face of known
8           danger is certainly a symptom of addiction.
9                Now, if -- if -- once he tried to stop -- and
10           we know that he knew it was not good for him back
11           in the early '70s because he threw John out of the
12           house because John was smoking.  Now, is that a
13           person who wants to smoke?  You know, as a parent,
14           he's telling his kids don't do it, throws one of
15           them out because he's doing it, yet he does it.
16           You know, how does that make him feel?  I mean,
17           this has happened to lots and lots of people, and
18           it happened to him.
19                I've used this example before.  You know,
20           everybody talks about motivation.  Well, if you're
21           a smoker and you've smoked for ten years or so and
22           you think, well, I'm going to stop smoking, well,
23           how much motivation do you need?  You don't know.
24           Now, what do you need when you're smoke -- now, by
25           1970, if he started even in 1950, let's say, you 23
1           know, you've got 20 years at a pack a day or more.  2           That is a lot of smoking.  So how do you know how
3           much motivation you need?  If you're -- if you're
4           lighting up a cigarette every 20 or 30 minutes,
5           well, you need motivation for the first one, but
6           then the second time -- the second cigarette time
7           comes around, you need some motivation for that
8           one, too.  And you need it for the third one and
9           the fourth one.
10                You need to keep fighting it and keep
11           fighting it until you get through those feelings
12           that you have of not feeling good, of not craving
13           the cigarette.  And finally you get to the point
14           where those receptors which were talked about,
15           those receptors in your brain that when you smoke,
16           it grows these receptors -- and you already have
17           some to start out with, but when you smoke, it
18           grows more.  And those receptors are craving the
19           nicotine.  They have to be satisfied.  And when
20           they're satisfied, you feel okay until you need
21           your next cigarette.  And then the cycle just
22           keeps repeating and repeating.
23                Well, is it like -- for some people, it's
24           like climbing Mount Everest.  Some people can do
25           that.  There's probably people in this room that 24
1           could climb Mount Everest if they really wanted
2           to, but most probably couldn't do that.  No matter
3           how much you want to do it, you have to work your
4           way up.  You have to be motivated all the way up.  5           Well, smoking for some people is like that.  And
6           for Mr. Gelep, he never made it.  He was -- he was
7           one of the 55 percent or, under this DSM book, was
8           unable to do it.  Or under the R.J. Reynolds
9           document, he was one of the ones that was unable
10           to do it.
11                Now, I want to talk just a second about the
12           defense witness the defense put on to say that he
13           wasn't addicted.  That was Dr. Seiden just the
14           other day on Friday.  And Dr. Seiden came from
15           Shreveport, Louisiana, down here to tell you to
16           satisfy their denial, to tell that you that
17           Mr. Gelep wasn't addicted.
18                Now, remember, this is a man who saw
19           thousands of patients and only diagnosed nicotine
20           addiction one time -- one time in his whole
21           career.  Only one -- he only met one addicted
22           smoker in his whole career.  That's crazy.
23                Now, I asked him about some of the things the
24           surgeon general said about how nicotine influences
25           the choice of the smoker, and he admitted it did. 25
1                We talked a little bit about personal
2           responsibility, you know, and I hinted at this
3           during the voir dire.  I'm going to mention it
4           again.  But I wanted first to tell you that, you
5           know, Dr. Seiden said, you know, there's
6           motivation and there's the behavior of the smoker
7           who seeks to quit; and at the same time, there's  8           the nicotine that's influencing that behavior.  He
9           admitted that, you know.  So you have this tension
10           there, and that tension is always there.
11                Now, I just want to mention this personal
12           responsibility aspect for just a second, because,
13           you know, personal responsibility is connected to
14           something.  Who -- who are you responsible to?
15           You're responsible to yourself.  You're
16           responsible to your family.  You're responsible to
17           your community.  You're responsible to the
18           United States of America.  You may be responsible
19           to God.  But should you have the same
20           responsibility toward the company that did the
21           things that these cigarette companies did to put
22           you in the position that you're in?  I think that
23           personal responsibility sort of breaks down right
24           there, because they should be responsible, too.
25           They should be accountable for what they did, too. 26
1                MS. PARKER:  Your Honor, objection.
2                MR. GERAGHTY:  Join, Your Honor.
3                THE COURT:  Sustained.
4                MR. ACOSTA:  Let me talk about lung cancer
5           for a second.
6                You saw this board that was not in black and
7           color when I showed it to you, but it was black
8           and white.
9                Too much weight there.  Well, this one is
10           just not going to behave for me, so maybe I can
11           get somebody to help me. 12                But you can see that the surgeon general had
13           in the 2004 report -- that was the big book.  Let
14           me grab this.  It was in this big book here, the
15           2004 surgeon general's report.  And it's model --
16                MS. PARKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  This was
17           impeachment, not evidence.
18                THE COURT:  It's limited to impeachment.
19                MR. ACOSTA:  I asked Dr. Seiden about this.
20           I asked him about this chart.  It goes from
21           nicotine addiction, carcinogens, to DNA, to
22           mutation and other changes, to lung cancer.
23                So what did the defense do?  Well, Dr. Seiden
24           knows about nicotine addiction, right?  But he
25           says, Well, I don't know about any of that other 27
1           stuff.  Of course, then they bring in Dr. Bennett.
2           He talked about lung cancer.  He doesn't talk
3           about addiction.
4                Well, this is the whole story right here.
5                Now, Dr. Groff, the psychiatrist, he touched
6           on the lung cancer and how addiction leads to
7           that.
8                Dr. Goldman, I mentioned to you, the fellow
9           from USF, talked about smoking being a cause of
10           primary lung cancer.  And that's what you're being
11           asked in this question -- that this was a solitary
12           nodule up in the upper right lobe of the lung.  It
13           had gone in and made at least one lymph node one 14           centimeter in size, which is right at the dividing
15           line of abnormal.
16                We talked about how if cancer came from some
17           other place you would see multiple metastasis in
18           the lung.  You wouldn't see just one primary site
19           like that.  And I think that Dr. Bennett
20           recognized that toward the end of the questions I
21           was asking him that it's very rare for a tumor to
22           come from some other place and just present as one
23           big nodule.  It doesn't happen.  It's very rare.
24                What's the probable thing?  Mr. Gelep smoked
25           a lot.  Cigarettes contain carcinogens.  It's a 28
1           dose response disease, which means the more you
2           smoke, the higher your risk.  Right?  And by the
3           way, he had already smoked enough and a lot by
4           1970.  That was a sufficient amount right there to
5           cause his lung cancer already.
6                He gets a big tumor that's found in his lung.
7           He goes to the doctor.  They have chest X-rays,
8           CT scan.  They do the broncho- -- bronchoscope,
9           putting that tube down his nose and into his lung
10           and looking around.  You know, we know the lung is
11           a target organ for these carcinogens.
12                So what's the most probable thing?  It's
13           probable that he has a primary lung cancer.  All
14           the doctors that saw him, according to
15           Dr. Bennett, were wrong.  He took little -- little
16           pieces of little statements in there and then 17           construed them a different way and showed you what
18           he thought was a different picture.
19                You know, you've got to remember, he said
20           he's a forensic doctor.  Well, that's a lawsuit
21           doctor.  He's testified a thousand times before
22           1994.  And then he said that he's testified about
23           500 times -- I think he said three times a month
24           times, what, 15 years?  That's another 500 -- it's
25           1,500 times he's testified. 29
1                The doctors that saw Mr. Gelep were convinced
2           of lung cancer.  Dr. Dunn, who you saw, was a
3           treating doctor.  He's a treating doctor.  He
4           treats patients every day, you know.  He came down
5           and he told you that he looked and had that little
6           brush and pushed the scope in as far as it would
7           go and got to the point where he couldn't look any
8           further.  He says that the bronchus was thickened
9           and that he found cancer cells inside.  And he was
10           convinced that it was a bronchiogenic carcinoma.
11                Well, even Dr. Bennett admitted "broncho"
12           means airway and "genic" means that's where it
13           starts.  It's bronchogenic.  It started in his
14           airway.  It's a primary lung cancer.
15                Mr. Gelep wanted to live.  They went up to
16           Sloan-Kettering in New York, one of 15 cancer --
17           NCI, National Cancer Institute, certified cancer
18           treatment centers in the country to get a second
19           opinion.  He takes his stuff up there with him. 20                The pathologist up there in New York looks at
21           the same slides.  What does he say?  Morphology is
22           bronchiogenic carcinoma of the lung.  Morphology
23           means, looks to me by just looking at the slide --
24           just looking at these cells tells me that this is
25           cancer of the lung.  That's a primary cancer of 30
1           the lung.  Dr. Goldman said that it was a primary
2           cancer of the lung as well.  That's what this man
3           had, was a primary cancer of the lung.
4                So think of it this way.  In this case, based
5           on all this evidence and all this stuff in the
6           medical records, which is the more probable?  Is
7           it more probable he had a primary cancer of the
8           lung, or is it more probable that he had a colon
9           cancer which no one ever saw?
10                He had an MRI of the abdomen.  In that MRI --
11           it's one of the records in there -- they didn't
12           see any colon cancer.
13                I'm just about done.
14                You know, it's cigarettes that caused the
15           epidemic of lung cancer.  It doesn't come from
16           other things, and we know why.  We know why.
17           Because people that start smoking them -- at least
18           a lot of them -- can't stop.  A lot of them can't,
19           you know, depending on what study you look at,
20           what statistic you look at.  But, you know, when
21           somebody in a family finds out that they've got
22           cancer, you know, there's a -- there's a fear. 23           The whole family is afraid.  The smoker's afraid.
24                Mr. Gelep, you know, had -- he knew where he
25           was headed, and he couldn't do anything about it. 31
1           You know, that's the tragedy of this is somebody
2           that smokes all the time, tried to quit a couple
3           times or more and is confronted with this
4           addiction -- he was chained to a giant; basically
5           chained to a giant.  And he couldn't break from
6           the chains from these cigarette companies.
7                So what does he think?  Am I weak?  Am I a
8           weakling?  What am I supposed -- what do you do?
9           What do you do when you can't stop doing something
10           that you want to do?  You know, it's a tragedy.
11                And now it's your turn.  I'm going to ask,
12           what are you going to do about it?  And what you
13           should do about it is check "yes" on this verdict
14           form.
15                We'll come back, and I can just guarantee
16           that this second phase will be very short -- very,
17           very, very short.
18                Thank you very much.


23                MR. ACOSTA:  May it please the Court.  This
24           will just take a few minutes. 25                One of the first things that Ms. Parker 105
1           talked about is the fact that cigarettes are
2           legal.  Everybody knows that they're legal.  You
3           know, they -- there's a lot of legal products that
4           don't work well or a lot of legal products that
5           you might find are unreasonably dangerous or
6           defective or whatever, but they're still legal.
7           You know, if you think about some of the things
8           that have been -- pharmaceuticals, asbestos,
9           there's lots of things like that.  They're all
10           legal.
11                You know, the government doesn't regulate
12           cigarettes.  That's why there was some testimony
13           from Dr. Farone.  There's nobody to tell Philip
14           Morris or Reynolds or American Tobacco how they
15           should make cigarettes, what they should put in
16           them, what they can put in them, what they can't
17           put in them; they're just not regulated.  They're
18           not regulated.  So they make the choice of what
19           they put in it.
20                Now, if they put a lot of bad things in it
21           and they do it on purpose to addict people, then
22           they can be held responsible for it.  That's why
23           we're here.  That's why we're here.  We came to
24           court to ask you to ultimately hold them at least
25           partially responsible for this. 106      MS. PARKER:  Objection.  Same objection as
2           before.
3                THE COURT:  Same ruling.
4                MR. ACOSTA:  Now, one of the things that they
5           talked about was, you know, Mr. Gelep, you know,
6           this is about him.  Well, if you think about it,
7           Mr. Gelep smoked about a million cigarettes.  If
8           he smoked, you know, 60 a day for 45 years, we're
9           getting pretty close to a million cigarettes.  And
10           then you multiply that by what, eight to 12 puffs
11           per cigarette?  What do you have then, eight
12           million doses -- eight million doses of
13           carcinogenic chemicals, up to 40 in every
14           cigarette smoke?  Eight million times.  That's
15           plenty to cause lung cancer.
16                This was the board that was used by
17           Ms. Parker.  And I want to tell you that the top
18           one, the location of the lung tumor, well, it was
19           central.  The doctors said -- I think even
20           Dr. Bennett said, you know, that's where you find
21           cigarette tumors -- the centrally located tumors.
22           Bronchiogenic is also where this was found, and
23           that makes lung cancer.
24                The cell type and the tumor.  The death
25           certificate -- and you'll see in the records there 107
1           are quite a few places where it's identified as an  2           adenocarcinoma -- adenocarcinoma of the lung.
3           Well, that happens to be the most common kind of
4           lung cancer.  So that's lung cancer.  Lung cancer.
5                Pattern and spread.  Well, remember it was in
6           the upper right lobe, and it was spreading into
7           the mediastinum through the central part and they
8           thought that they needed to give him radiation
9           because of the possibility of what's called vena
10           cava syndrome.  And that's where the tumor pushes
11           up against the -- it's a vein that comes back down
12           from the head so that your head doesn't fill up
13           with blood.  So they radiated that area.  But that
14           tumor was invading into the mediastinum, it
15           invaded into a rib, and you'll see that -- the
16           fifth rib -- in the records, and then there was
17           the one centimeter node.  That's the kind of
18           spread you see with lung cancer.  That's what you
19           see with lung cancer.
20                Presenting symptoms.  Presenting symptoms.
21           He had a cough.  It didn't go away.  He had what
22           he thought was a cold.  Dr.  Hansen  said that he
23           thought he had walking pneumonia.  Well, those are
24           the kind of symptoms you expect to have and
25           present with when you have lung cancer. 108
1                Pathology staining.  I showed you the report
2           about CEA.  CEA is CEA, whether it's staining onto
3           a slide or it's in a lab report.  And it said it's
4           nonspecific, it's high in smokers -- which his  5           was -- found in smokers, it's not specific, and
6           you don't use it to screen.  The -- you know,
7           Dr. Bennett said that he sent his own cases up to
8           Sloan-Kettering.  This was the defense expert, the
9           guy that testified 1500 times as a forensic
10           pathologist -- he sent his cases to
11           Sloan-Kettering.  Sloan-Kettering looked at these
12           pathology.  If there was something wrong with this
13           staining, if it wasn't enough, they would have
14           said something.  But you've got a second opinion
15           from one of the best hospitals in the country.
16           There was no necessity for DNA testing.  There was
17           no necessity for an autopsy.  Why would you get an
18           autopsy when everybody agrees it's lung cancer,
19           and you find out later the cigarette company comes
20           in and says it's something else?
21                Just a couple more points, and then I'm going
22           to be done.
23                You know, I don't know if you caught this,
24           but a Freudian slip is something that somebody
25           makes -- 109
1                THE COURT:  Counsel, I think you need to
2           approach the bench.
3                (The following proceedings took place at
4           sidebar:)
5                THE COURT:  Let me guess, you're going to say
6           that Ms. Parker has said that it caused his
7           cancer.
8                MR. ACOSTA:  She did.  9                THE COURT:  Well, you're not going to be
10           attributing a Freudian slip to her comments in
11           closing argument as some indication that somehow
12           she believed that that's what the case is.  She
13           was in her counter alternative argument about
14           addiction, which is only applicable if they reject
15           her first argument about lung cancer.  So I'm not
16           going to permit this argument.
17                MR. ACOSTA:  Okay.
18                (Sidebar concluded.)
19                MR. ACOSTA:  All right.  We're going to
20           forget about the Freudian slip.
21                And what we're going to talk about is
22           Mr. Geraghty's discussion about the brands.
23                One of the things that Mr. Geraghty didn't
24           talk about is Helen's testimony.  You might recall
25           Helen was up there testifying.  And she's the one 110
1           that said back in her deposition a long time ago
2           that her dad switched to Marlboro around 1975 --
3           that's because she stole cigarettes from him
4           before she graduated from high school.  You saw
5           her.  And if you remember, John testified about
6           True in '79 and '80.  There isn't anything
7           sinister going on about these brands.  What
8           happened is these folks got together before the
9           trial and looked at a bunch of -- all these photos
10           to refresh their recollection so that when they 11           came in here they would be giving the best
12           evidence that they could.
13                When they signed -- the mom signed
14           interrogatories a long time ago, they thought that
15           was true then.  But, you know, like most people,
16           you think about it, you get in a lawsuit.  And,
17           you know, it's ten years later in the same
18           lawsuit, so now you finally get to go to trial,
19           and you look at the photos to see if you can put
20           the whole thing together.
21                Helen also testified about Merit cigarettes,
22           which is, you know, another brand.  So from '75 to
23           '95, there was some Philip Morris -- and you can
24           look at these photos and see what you think of the
25           packages on the originals.  And a lot of them 111
1           look -- the '79/'80 one looks like a True, and
2           that fits with John's testimony.  But some of
3           these others don't, they look like Marlboro.  So,
4           you know, that's what they said, and you just have
5           to take it for what it's worth, but it certainly
6           wasn't something that was said or done to be
7           something sinister in the case.
8                Those are the only comments I have on this
9           part of the trial, and so I hope to see you again.
10           Thank you.
