MR. CORR:
Thank you, Your Honor.
May it please the Court, Counsel.
Good morning.
FROM THE FLOOR:
Good morning.
CLOSING ARGUMENT
BY MR. CORR:
Sometimes it takes us a long time
to get to these points, right?
started, as Judge Cox said, this is our opportunity
to present our final argument based on the evidence
that you've heard during the trial here.
So before I get
Okay?
And I do want to say, on behalf of Bob Gore and
the attorneys on our side -- I'm sure I speak for 2674
the attorneys on the other side as well -- how much
we appreciate the time and the sacrifice that you've
You know when we started this trial we said
made.
that we were going to be three weeks.
Fortunately
we were able to cut some things down and get it to
you today on -- on Monday of the third week.
we're a little quicker than we had anticipated, but
I think that's a good thing for everybody.
And you
found, you know, like we said, I think during
Dr. Burns's testimony I had asked him a question:
This isn't like TV, right?
So
I mean everything happens on TV in an hour.
You know, you get the murder, the trial, the
conviction within the -- an hour.
And here, in real
life, it takes a little time for us to get things to
There's arguments that happen outside of your
you.
hearing, things that are going on all the time.
The
Judge has some requirements for us, we have to do
those things and you sit and wait.
appreciate that.
sometimes, but we really do appreciate that.
We know it's frustrating
And we really do
And it's very important to our system, as we
discussed in the beginning, you know, that we have
juries who can come in here and help the two sides
settle a dispute like this. So as Judge Cox just instructed you, the first

Right?
We talked about,
thing that you're going to have to decide in this
case is class membership.
in opening statements, this Engle class and is
Mrs. Gore a member of this particular class.
you're going to see on the verdict form, this is the
first question that you're going to get on the
verdict form.
addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine and, if
so, was her addiction a legal cause of her carotid
artery stenosis?
The question is:
Was Gloria Gore
And
Okay.
So that's what class membership is.
That's the first question and that's what you're
going to have to answer on class membership.
What is class membership not?
Class membership
All
It's not about awareness.
You've heard a lot of evidence, and we're
is not about fault.
right.
going to talk about those -- that evidence in
this -- but that's not what class membership is
about.
Those are things for consideration when
you're determining the percent of liability and
things of that nature but not with respect to class
membership.
Because class membership really is just
two questions:
cigarettes containing nicotine?
Was Gloria Gore addicted to
And was her addiction a legal cause of her carotid stenosis?
Those are the two questions for
All right.

So we're just separating out the

about the documents, the internal documents.
And
he's going to show you some of those documents and

We
talked a little bit about it during the trial.
Those documents are in evidence.

Those are things
You're going to be able to
Okay.
He's going to show you those
But the first question is this class
membership, and these are the two components of it.
These are the only two components of that.

present you any evidence on those issues.
They cross-examined our witnesses, but the opinions
and the evidence that you're going to have in front
of you, this all points to Gloria Gore was addicted
to nicotine in cigarettes and that addiction is what
caused her carotid stenosis.
Okay.
Who were the addiction witnesses?
Okay.
You
She said Mrs. Gore
heard from Christina Savage, right?
Mrs. Gore's oldest daughter.
smoked every day, one to two packs per day.
during Christina's entire life.
born in 1960, she said -- 19- -- I think she
recalled, as early as 1963, when she was three years
old, that her mom smoked like this every single day.
That's
She is
Right.
She was 2678
And she smoked even after she was diagnosed with
lung cancer.
And you're going to see that in the records.
In the medical records, you will see that Mrs. Gore
continued to smoke after she had her carotid
stenosis in 1992.

was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Now, as far as the brands that were used, he
couldn't recall brands because they're kids, right?
So they're swapping cigarettes from one to the
other.
So there
was no true brand loyalty at that time, but that
came later.
Who's got this?
Who's got one?
Robert Gore.
Bob Gore talked about two things,
right, with respect to -- two things that kind of
stick out in my mind, anyway, the two video clips.
He was asked questions about these things in his
depositions.
he was on the stand.
He was asked questions about it when

MR. CORR:
You can switch back to the PowerPoint, Josh.

face of danger, just as Dr. Burns testified is the
definition of addiction.
She goes out because she
needed to get the nicotine in those cigarettes.
She

trash can, and smoked those just to get what she
needed.

"Well, she would get up and have her coffee and read
the newspaper."
I mean, he's trying
to argue that she read the newspaper and there were
articles in the newspapers.
She smoked
He would say,

Right?
Well, what was she doing when she read the
newspapers?
Dr. Burns said before she hit the

That's some of

Okay.
That's just
Who goes
Who tries
This is a slide I used with you in opening, and
Dr. Burns testified about it.
Just to round off the
numbers, we used 35 years, which would take her back
to 1965, suppose, pack and a half per day would be 2685
10,950 cigarettes a year.
383,250 cigarettes during that smoking
lifetime.
All right.
3,835,500 lifetime exposures to nicotine.
Okay.
If we talked about any other substance
there would be no question in our minds that that
person is addicted.
We know from their
internal documents they knew all along, all along,
when they were out there saying cigarettes are not
addictive; nicotine is not addictive, you'll see in
their documents, they knew all along it wasn't -- it
was addictive.
And I believe they refer to it as
"highly addictive" in their documents.
And you'll
see, also, in there, documents where they discuss
the Surgeon General's Report.
about the Surgeon General's Report of 1988 where
they compared nicotine to cocaine and heroin, and
it's in their documents.
And where they talked
Right?
You also have medical evidence.
1999,
Mrs. Gore was -- was diagnosed with carotid stenosis
in 1992.
She's back to Dr. Beckett in 1999; and one
of the impressions at that time, Dr. Beckett notes
in that record, you'll -- you'll remember that she

medication; only purpose of Zyban was to help you 2686
That's the only purpose for
Dr. Beckett diagnosed her at the time with

her.
smoking addiction.
Okay?
Now, in the opening statement, I told you that
But Dr. Burns was
Dr. Beckett, I thought, was going to come in and
testify about these things.
actually able to talk about this visit that
Mrs. Gore had with Dr. Beckett.
Also was able to
testify about the 1992 visit and give his opinions
on the smoking addiction and the carotid stenosis.
I guess we could have brought Dr. Beckett in to take
some more time up, but glad we're here on Monday
doing our closings.
So what we did bring you was Dr. Burns, and
He gave you his CV.
He's done nothing but this
Dr. Burns worked his whole life on issues of smoking
It's in evidence.
and health.
It goes through all of the history that he's had
with smoking and health.
ever since he started as a doctor, right?
written or edited or been involved with every
Surgeon General's Report on smoking and health since
He treated patients -- as a practicing
1975.
physician, he treated patients with nicotine
addiction.
patients with carotid stenosis.
As a practicing physician, he treated
As a practicing
He's 2687
physician, he treated patients with lung cancer.
And he's written extensively on addiction, smoking,
and health.
So when you're evaluating witnesses, think
about who we brought to you.
We brought you the
best of the best; the person that the government
relies to help with Surgeon General Reports; the
person who has spent his whole life on these issues.
That's the expert that you've heard in this case.
They
Because they didn't bring you anybody.
They brought nobody in to challenge
brought nobody to come in and challenge his opinions
on addiction.
his opinions on whether the addiction caused the
carotid stenosis; and they brought nobody in to
challenge his opinions on the relationships between
the addiction to nicotine and lung cancer.
What was Dr. Burns's opinion?
His opinion is
that her repetitive inhalation of cigarette smoke,
due to her addiction, directly and as a result of
that exposure, produced the carotid stenosis and
lung cancer that occurred in this lady and that
caused her death.
specifically about the addiction, he said there is
no question in my mind that this lady was powerfully
addicted.
And when he was asked 2688
I think you can tell from all the evidence that
was there all of the conduct that you heard from the
witnesses what Mrs. Gore was doing, how she smoked,
what she smoked, when she smoked.
Dr. Burns is right:
She was addicted.
Clearly,
So it certainly
Right?
We know that.
Choice says nothing about
You're either addicted or you're not.
Now, one of the other things you heard about in
opening, even back in jury selection, right, choice.
The word "choice."
addiction.
The choice was it is a percentage of fault that's --
that's where choice comes in.
doesn't come in on addiction, it has nothing to do
with it.

stop smoking.

classes, which was three days with her friends who
went to the smoking cessation classes; didn't work
Prescription medication, when she was
for her.
diagnosed with carotid stenosis in 1992, at some
point between that time and 1999, she got a
prescription to try to help her stop smoking.
That's the choice she made.
addiction takes your choice away.

But when she got that
The questions they're asking -- and they're
going to try to get you to believe that the choice
is affected by the -- affects the addiction -- the
fact is, the questions they ask, the answers that
you heard prove the addiction.
Okay?
You can look at their own documents.
It is the addiction.
And 2690
I'll tell you right now -- I'm going to start giving
you document numbers that you should put on your
reading list when you get these documents to you --
but one document, TL 02759.
Okay?
In that document, you'll see this quote:
The
habituated user of tobacco -- I can't read my own
handwriting -- is said to derive -- oh -- of tobacco
products is said to derive, quote, 'satisfaction'
from nicotine.
That's in their records the -- you derive
Read the document.
the -- you get the satisfaction from the nicotine.
The document goes on.
It goes
on to discuss the psychological effects of nicotine,
how good it is for the industry that nicotine is
both habituating or addictive and is unique in
providing those physiologic and psychological
effects.
that's what they have to keep going.
keep people addicted to sell their products.
There's no other reason to smoke a cigarette.
There's none.
They can do it.

That's what they do.
He testified about how companies extract the
nicotine; they can take it right out of the tobacco
and spray it back on before they manufacture it and
sell it to you.
And they --
why do they do it?
To keep a consistent level, a
consistent product so that when you smoke your
brand, you get the same level of nicotine, you need
the same number of cigarettes to get that level of
nicotine.
That's why they do it.

All you're getting is carcinogens at that
There's no nicotine.
The other thing you're going to hear and you're
Since 1953
going to see this in their documents:
both of these companies have had a goal of confusing
people like Gloria Gore and the American public.
You see, they brought up Reader's Digest articles --
first of all, they talked about articles -- I think
Mr. Walker asked questions, right -- well, these
scientific things, they were in the New England
Journal of Medicine and they were in the -- you know
the journal of such and such cancer.
how many of you have subscriptions to those
journals, but the only place you could get those
things in the 1950s, '60s, '70s were in the library.
Right?

article, not by a scientist, but by an author, and
you read that article, every one of those articles
has something from the tobacco company shooting down
what's in the article.
Right.
They showed you the thing from the LIFE
In there, the American Tobacco Company
magazine.
saying this isn't really what it, you know, you have
a little sentence in there, it's, "Yeah.
right.
everybody should stop smoking because then everybody
is going to have nervous habits."
That's
That's out there, but this doesn't mean
Reader's Digest, they put out the Reader's
Digest and asked Dr. Burns questions about that.
What they didn't show him, there's a whole section
on the tobacco industry and the tobacco lobby and
how they're paying people to get the senators and
all these other people to do what they want.
Right.
Every one of them has
There's other articles.
something in them from the tobacco company that
gives you just that little bit of confusion, that
Just plant the seed of doubt
little bit of doubt.
and let it grow.
Because the addiction is
going to take over from there.
Okay.
You know, they're going to do the same thing
here.
Right.
They're trying to confuse you by 2694
saying, "Well, it was her choice.
She enjoyed it.
calm."
It made her relax.
She had a choice.
It made her
That's the addiction.
That's the confusion
Okay.
that they're trying to do in this trial.
And
remember, that there's going to be a document -- and
you'll see this again when Mr. Foote speaks --
TL 00055.
depend on choice if she's addicted.
defend on choice if she's addicted.
They say in there, they can't
They can't
Right.
Cigarette brands, okay, I just want to talk
briefly about this, which brands she's smoked.
There's been plenty of evidence she smoked Kool,
Belair, Virginia Slims, Benson & Hedges Lights, and
Benson & Hedges Ultralights is what she was smoking
when she died.
There's been no dispute about these brands.
We did have testimony from Kelly Welton
Nobody has come in and said she wasn't smoking them.
Right.
about all of the brands, right.
brands was used, she remembered them.
she progressed, her mom progressed during her
lifetime.
She went from the filters, right, to the
lights and then to the ultralights, always menthol,
right?
Every one of those
She said that
Always the medicated menthol that you saw 2695
the advertisements, how they would advertise it as
menthol soothes your throat.
selling Kools with menthol as fresh as a breath of
fresh air.
That's how they're selling cigarettes,
fresh air.
Remember how they were
Christina Savage also talked about the
This is what she
And you see in the document that I
So
menthols, the filtered, the slims.
was smoking.
just put in, they were keeping track of this.
you'll see from 1993, Gore 144 that we just put into
evidence in rebuttal, lists they tracked exactly
what brands she was smoking.
What they have in
there is the Benson & Hedges because, it starts, I
think, in 1993, always Benson & Hedges since 1993.
Okay?
But how do you know, then, which brands she was
Well, Dr. Burns testified, from his review
smoking?
of the medical records, from the depositions, that
she smoked Kool and Belair from 1963 to 1970, which

I just want to talk briefly about filters
because there was some testimony in the case about
filters and that, you know, Mrs. -- Mrs. Gore always
smoked filters, right?
menthols -- there were two things:
supposed to soothe; filters were supposed to clean
it out and make it less harmful.
All her life she smoked
Menthol was
And we know that's what she believed because
Mr. Gore testified, when he was on the stand, that
the reason she did is because the advertising told
that they put filters on it.
They put -- they put
menthol on there to help -- she really didn't
believe she was one of the ones that was going to
get cancer because of all those filters.
She 2697

they knew, when they were promoting filters as
safer -- as a safer alternative to the unfiltered,

Judge Cox read this to you, "Addiction to smoking

contributes substantially to producing such disease
or medical condition so that it can reasonably be
said that, but for the addiction to cigarettes
containing nicotine, such disease or medical
condition would not have been suffered."
So Dr. Burns talked to you about, you know,
this repetitive action of bringing in all those
carcinogens into your body, into the lung and
essentially bathing the lung in carcinogens, right?
And -- and when he showed you how cancer forms and
it builds and builds and builds, this is what he's
talking about.
He's talking about it directly and
in a natural and continuance sequence produced or

Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it over
to Mr. Foote.
  
  
          MR. FOOTE:  Thank you, Judge.
          Good afternoon.
          THE JURY:  Good afternoon.
          MR. FOOTE:  As Mr. Corr told you, I'm
     going to talk a lot about what the defendants
     did in this case. Lung cancer is an epidemic in this
     country, one of the worst epidemics of the 20th
     century.  20 million people died prematurely
     because of the products that the defendants
     sold.  20 million people died prematurely
     because of cigarettes.
          Now, they have a perfect right to sell
     cigarettes, but as you heard from the Judge,
     they don't have a right to sell defective
     cigarettes.  They don't have a right to lie
     about their cigarettes.  They don't have a
     right to conceal things about their cigarettes,
     and that's exactly what they did during the
     entire time that Gloria Gore smoked.
          From 1953 I'll tell you about how the
     conspiracy was formed, until 2000.  The entire
     time she smoked they did those things.  They
     sold defective cigarettes and they lied about
     them and they concealed things.
          We all know the public story.  We all know
     the public story.  It's affected many, many
     lives.  People smoke, they get sick, they die
     prematurely.
          What people didn't know was the hidden
     story.  People did not know the hidden story until they were forced to turn over all the
     documents that you've seen some of which and
     the documents that I will talk about today, and
     that hidden story talks about how they picked
     profits over people.  The hidden story talks
     about how they designed a nicotine delivery
     device.
          This isn't a cigarette.  This isn't a
     roll-your-own.  This is nicotine delivery
     device that they spent a lot of money
     designing; a very addictive nicotine delivery
     product.  That's what their own documents say.
          They also showed that as far, farther back
     than Gloria Gore started smoking they targeted
     youth smokers.  The reason they targeted youth
     smokers is because they were killing the older
     smokers and in order to keep their sales up,
     they needed replacements for the people that
     they were killing, and you'll see how they
     targeted the youth in this conspiracy, which
     again, lasted exactly the time period that
     Gloria Gore was smoking.
          Can we go to the first slide, Josh.
          As this is coming up, remember where we
     were in 1953.  In 1953 cigarettes had become part of the popular culture.  Because so many
     people had started smoking in the early part of
     the century, lung cancer was becoming a
     problem, and in 1953 there was a scare, a
     health scare.  They called it "a health scare"
     in their documents.  They don't say "we were
     killing people with lung cancer."  A health
     scare, there was a health scare in 1953.
          So what did the tobacco companies do in
     response to the health scare?  They said, well
     let's take a look at what is really going on in
     the science out there.  This isn't PR.  This
     isn't making things up.  Let's take a look at
     the science.
          So what they did is they had Mr. Claude
     Teague -- and you're going to see a lot of
     documents from Claude Teague.  You know why?
     Because he told the truth in his documents.  He
     told the truth in his documents, but they kept
     them confidential, and they kept them
     confidential until about the time that Gloria
     died.
          So what did he do?  He went out and looked
     around the world, not just the United States,
     about every bit of evidence there was, about whether or not smoking was causing disease,
     whether or not.  He didn't have a decision made
     when he started this process.
          If you remember, I talked to Dr. Burns --
     and you'll see it in this document, the
     three-page bibliography.  Every piece of real
     science there was at that time in the world he
     looked at.  What did he decide?  He decided
     that there was a relationship between smoking
     and cancer of the lung.  1953, their smartest
     guy figured this out.
          So now there's a problem.  There's a
     health scare.  Profits are down.  Sales are
     down.  I'll show you the chart later.  This was
     an opportunity for these companies to make a
     huge choice, one of the most important choices
     of the 20th century.  Accept it, accept what
     their scientist told them, or hide it.  That
     was their choice.
          A good choice would have been accept it,
     go public about it, try to help people with it.
     Instead, as you'll see in the conspiracy, they
     tried to hide it.
          They knew -- you'll see when you read
     these documents, they knew they were going to lose the war eventually.  They knew science
     would eventually prevail and everyone would
     know how dangerous these products were.  But
     they also knew they could win battles.  They
     could win a battle for 10 years, they could win
     a battle for 20 years.
          They won the battle until the time that
     Gloria Gore died.  That's when the government
     came down on them and made them publish all
     this stuff and made them admit, finally, that
     these things were addictive, that they caused
     disease.
          Everything we know true today, the public
     face of these companies today, are things they
     didn't do voluntarily.  The government made
     them do it.  They won battles till the time
     Gloria died.
          Next slide, please.
          So it starts at the Plaza Hotel in New
     York City, which was right by Central Park, and
     for the first time in history every major
     tobacco company had the top guy in their
     company at a meeting, and at that meeting again
     they had to make a choice.  Were they going to
     come clean or were they going to hide what was going on; and in concert with them was the PR
     firm we talked about.  They were part of the
     meeting.  They set up the agenda for them.
          Let's go to the next slide.
          What Hill & Knowlton did before the
     meeting was they came up with a PR plan and
     they understood -- they did a lot of work.
     They understood what the problem was and they
     understood what the plan needed to be, and the
     plan they came up with was something that
     stayed the same until Gloria died.
          Their plan was they wanted to give
     confidence to the public in the -- instead of a
     health scare they wanted confidence.  They
     wanted to find a way to give them confidence
     and they wanted to convince the public that the
     tobacco companies were on their side so the
     tobacco companies would trust them, so that
     when one of the tobacco company executives went
     on TV in the clips you saw, that they would
     trust that person and not trust the Surgeon
     General.
          This was the plan from the very beginning,
     from the very first day they all got together.
          Next slide, please. What they did, what the PR people did is
     they interviewed all kinds of people from the
     tobacco companies so they would understand the
     depth of the problem, and from those interviews
     we know what the tobacco companies really knew
     in 1953 before all this started.
          We know that they knew cigarettes were
     addicting and you'll see they denied it all the
     way till when they swore before Congress.  We
     know that they knew they caused cancer.  Their
     scientists had done all the work.  But you'll
     see they deny it all the way into the '80s and
     the '90s.  They deny there's a scientific
     connection between cigarettes and cancer.
          So let's go to the next slide.
          This is the choice, truth or profits.
     This was drafted by their PR people to send out
     to every single person in the country so that
     every single person in the country would know
     things that based on what you saw on the
     previous slides, they knew were lies back then.
          They knew that cigarettes caused disease.
     Their employees admitted it, their scientists
     found it.  They knew they were not going to put
     health first.  They were going to put profits first, and this was the operative moment that
     affected Gloria's life seriously.
          Had they made the choice then to come
     clean, we probably wouldn't be here today.
     They made that choice and they stuck with it
     till the government made them change it.
          Next page, please.
          They told the people -- why did they tell
     them this?  They wanted them to believe they're
     going to cooperate with all the health
     authorities, with those whose task it is to
     safeguard the public.
          We'll get it to later, but one of the
     things that they did was they hid what they
     knew about filters.  They hid it to the extent
     that they even put away the Surgeon General.
     The Surgeon General told people -- because they
     didn't have the evidence the tobacco companies
     had -- that filters might be safer for you, and
     that's the sort of thing that Gloria relied on
     while she continued to smoke filter after
     filter after filter cigarette.
          If they could trick the Attorney
     General -- the Surgeon General.  I may say that
     a few times, I'm not sure why.  If they can trick the Surgeon General, how hard was it to
     trick Gloria?  Ask yourself that question.
          Next page, please.
          How did their experiment go?  They hired
     Hill & Knowlton and they used -- they created
     the TIRC, which you heard about, and they used
     their PR people and the TIRC for four years to
     fight the health scare that had caused tobacco
     sales to go down, tobacco profits to go down,
     tobacco stock to go down.  And what was the
     result of this conspiratorial effort after four
     years?  They won.
          They communicated back and forth to each
     other, what we did worked.  Our conspiracy
     worked for the last four years.  And so
     therefore, having won, now tobacco sales are
     back up, profits are back up.  They knew this
     would work and they went on a plan to continue
     this for as long as they could get away with
     it.
          Part of the plan was who were they going
     to use as the players in their plan to win as
     many battles as they could?  The players were
     their executives, as you saw.  The players were
     scientists, as you've seen, their own scientists.  They used those people to convince
     the public as best they could that it was okay
     to smoke.
          They had certain weapons they used in PR
     to have this conspiracy continue, and I'm going
     to go through sort of one by one; the
     categories, what these weapons were, and it's
     all in their efforts.
          First, I want to be clear -- go to the
     next slide -- remember, there's no doubt about
     this. From the time Gloria got hooked until she
     died there is no doubt that smoking caused
     cancer.
          Next slide.
          Remember Dr. Farone -- and you have to put
     Dr. Farone in context.  He started as somebody
     working for Philip Morris.  He went in there
     with every good intention.  As you saw, he
     wanted to help, and he gave you on the first
     day of trial one of his four opinions.  We're
     going to go through each of them.
          One of his opinions, having been someone
     who was behind the walls at Philip Morris, was
     it was known for a long time that there was
     this connection.  So we have to start with that factual foundation.  They always knew.  So what
     was one of the weapons that they used?
          Go to the next slide.
          Doubt.  Doubt's a weapon.  Doubt is a way
     to win battles.  Doubt is a way that you can
     keep politicians, you can keep the smokers, you
     can keep people who haven't started smoking
     yet.  Doubt is a way to make sure that you can
     keep people buying cigarettes.  They actually
     say in their own records, "Doubt is the limit
     of our product."
          They say that because they know when the
     doubt is gone there's going to be a big change
     in the world about how things happen to
     smoking.
          Next page.
          So the plan was -- you see that this is a
     Hill & Knowlton document -- the plan was to use
     the media, cast the media out there so that
     they could keep doubt in people's minds.  The
     most important type of story is the one that
     casts doubt on the cause and effect theory of
     disease and smoking.
          Now, they knew this was a lie, that this
     was a way they could win a battle. Another weapon they used was -- go to the
     next one -- psychology, the psychology they
     used to increase profits.  They studied how to
     habituate people.
          I'm not sure how many of you remember
     B.F. Skinner; B.F. Skinner, the psychologist
     who learned how to habituate people and
     mammals, whether it was rats or dogs or people.
     Skinnerian psychology was how to habituate
     people, and that's what they studied.
          Next slide.
          What they learned is you need to put the
     smoker in a situation where he just keeps
     pushing the lever, keeps pushing the lever,
     keeps pushing the lever, and they talk about it
     right here.  Smoking the cigarette is the lever
     pressed.  There are studies about psychology to
     get people to continue to press the lever.
          Next page.
          Now, you remember the Cullmans.  They're
     all related, I assume.  I don't know for a
     fact.  There was generations of Cullmans and
     you remember Mr. Cullman -- one of the Cullmans
     was the one who talked about the fact that
     there was really no problem with smoking and yes, maybe babies might be smaller, but some
     women like to have smaller babies anyway.
     That's what he's saying to the public.
          What is he saying here?  Give smokers a
     psychological crutch and a self rationale to
     continue smoking.
          That's how they used psychology.  They
     knew what Dr. Burns told you, that if someone
     is addicted, it's easy to keep them in the
     cycle with the psychological crutch.  A
     psychological crutch like "menthol is better in
     your throat."  A psychological crutch like
     "filters aren't going to kill you."  A
     psychological crutch like "not only do we have
     light cigarettes, we have ultralight
     cigarettes, and they're not going to kill you."
          Another weapon they used in PR was
     creating controversy where none existed.  Sort
     of related to doubt.
          You can go to the next slide.
          So what their organization did was go
     anywhere they could to find something that they
     could somehow allege showed that a cigarette
     might not cause a disease.
          This is in 1970.  They have known by this point for almost 20 years that it does cause
     the disease, but this is how they kept the
     battle going in the '70s.
          Go to the next slide, please.
          They even had plans as to exactly how they
     should do it, and you know what one of the
     plans was you heard in this trial?  One of the
     plans -- this is 1961, something showing that
     "many lung cancers may be metastatic from some
     other organs."
          What did you hear in the cross examination
     of Dr. Burns?  Could this be from some other
     organ?  They've had this same theory, a way to
     move the public away from the basic idea that
     this was lung cancer caused by cigarettes.
     They've been doing this since 1961, and I'm
     sure you're going to hear about this from
     Mr. McCarter this afternoon.
          Next slide.
          They actually went to the point of
     publishing papers that had little articles in
     them, even though they knew this was untrue,
     about things would give consumers some
     confidence, some reason to keep smoking.
          "Nearly half of a thousand lung cancer cases found to be nonsmokers."  Well, if people
     who aren't smoking get cancer, maybe it doesn't
     matter if they smoke or not.
          "Lung specialists say 28 reasons for
     doubting cigarette cancer."  Well, if there's
     28 reasons, maybe I won't get cancer.  So maybe
     I shouldn't fight that addiction.  Maybe I
     should just keep smoking.
          "March birth lung cancer limit."  If you
     weren't born in March, you might not get lung
     cancer.  Has nothing to do with cigarettes.
          That's the sort of creating a controversy
     they put out there and that continued even
     after 1982.
          Go to the next slide.
          This is 1982.  Actually, it's 1984 now.
     Remember the Tobacco Institute?  They are still
     publishing things meant for the public to
     consume, an entire summary of the controversy
     about smoking.  Because if they can make it a
     controversy, then people may have doubt and
     they may decide it's okay to smoke, but in
     reality there was no controversy in 1982.
          Next page.
          I'm not going to go through each of them, but they continued making statements after 1982
     to the general public about why there's a
     controversy.
          Next page, same.
          Now, another way they can win battles --
     you can go to the next slide -- if something
     turns up internally that they might have to
     show publicly would show that they were lying,
     one of the weapons they had was -- because it
     was secret, just hide all that stuff.
          So if you remember, this T.S. Osdene was
     one of their internal scientists, one of the
     people that they told the public was there to
     find out things and to tell the public the
     truth, and this Mr. Osdene is concerned they
     might have come up with something that would
     help smokers.  He's concerned that they're
     digging -- this is the scientist -- "We are
     digging our own grave."
          What does that mean?  We can't have this
     happen because our profits will go down.  We
     need to pick profits over people.  That's what
     this is saying.  We need to pick profits over
     people.
          Next page. We don't know that the study that Carolyn
     did, we don't know what happened to it.  We do
     know that there's evidence that nicotine is as
     addictive as morphine and caffeine -- morphine.
          Next slide.
          Here's Dr. Farone again.  Remember, he was
     there.  He was working for Philip Morris and he
     knew that if something came up that actually --
     an internal thing, an internal study that was
     actually going to help smokers, they would
     never let it see the day of light and maybe
     never even let them see their research if it
     started to turn against them.
          The next weapon they had -- next page --
     attack the Surgeon General.  You have to
     remember the power that they had in the media.
     It sounds silly to attack the Surgeon General.
     You have to remember the time.  You have to
     remember the power they had in the media.  You
     have to remember the fact that they spent a
     long time making their executives look like
     they were helping the public, making their
     executives make sure that there was a
     controversy and they tried to make the Surgeon
     General look like a nut.  This is some crazy health nut out there.
          The Surgeon General was trying to protect
     people and when he would do something that was
     trying to protect people, they would come out
     with a statement like -- "claims that
     cigarettes are addictive are irresponsible
     scare tactics."
          This is in 1988.  Now, they've known this
     fact since the '50s and yet to keep winning
     another battle they say things like this about
     the Attorney General. (sic)
          Next page.
          They went so far in '72 as to accuse the
     Attorney General (sic) of lying when he came
     out with a reason why people should not smoke.
          Next, please.
          Dr. Burns, if you remember, he was there
     starting in 1975.  He started working for the
     Surgeon General and his goal was health and
     every time, in his observation, starting in
     1975, that the Surgeon General tried to do
     something about health, they were roadblocked.
     They were roadblocked by the defendants.
          Next.
          Nicotine is obviously an important part of this case and what they really knew about
     nicotine, what they said internally about
     nicotine, how they even figured out the exact
     dosage of nicotine that would keep people
     addicted the right way -- you know, you can
     have too much nicotine and you won't like it
     and you can have too little nicotine and it's
     not addictive.  So you have to find that middle
     ground, which is what a lot of their time and
     effort went into.
          What's the middle ground where nicotine is
     addictive, but it's not going to make people
     sick?  Remember, it's a poison, so we have to
     follow that middle ground.  So we spent a lot
     of time in engineering a complex device to
     deliver nicotine the right way, in the right
     amount, so that they could keep people
     addicted.
          Next slide.
          Manufacture cigarettes to ensure that
     smokers obtain enough nicotine to sustain their
     addiction.  Find the right level and you'll
     sell more cigarettes.
          Next slide.
          They knew that a cigarette without nicotine would fail, because they knew what
     they were selling was nicotine.  That's what
     they were selling.  They were selling nicotine
     and they knew how to get people addicted to
     nicotine.  If it doesn't lead to habituation,
     they're out of business.
          This, again, is the honest Mr. Teague.
     Mr. Teague shows up again and again.  He said
     behind the scenes that was true, but they
     didn't let anybody see what he was saying,
     because it would cause a public stir.
          Can you imagine what would have happened
     in 1966 if this document would have been made
     public?
          Next.
          It is the entire basis of the industry,
     nicotine.  Again, they know this in 1972.  That
     is the basis of their industry.
          Next page.
          You heard Mr. Corr talk about this.
     Again, Mr. Teague is being honest.  It's good
     for the tobacco industry that nicotine is
     habituating.  They're happy about it.  They're
     happy about that, because that's what's driving
     the sales.  That's what's driving the profits, nicotine delivery system.
          Next.
          Now, what's interesting is -- again, this
     is Mr. Teague, the internal honest man.  What's
     interesting is it's hard to get people
     sometimes to start smoking, and Mr. Teague knew
     this.  "We somehow must convince him with
     wholly irrational reasons why he should try
     smoking."  Because they knew internally that
     this was a two-stage process.
          First someone has to learn about smoking.
     For some reason it doesn't make sense.  You
     cough, it doesn't taste good, you get a
     headache.  But if you can keep them at it long
     enough, they get the real satisfaction.  The
     real satisfaction is the addiction.
          Would you rather not have an addiction or
     would you rather enjoy when you take a puff
     because you're satisfying your addiction?  Ask
     yourself that question.  Which would people
     rather have?
          Next.
          Basically they're admitting here that
     they're a drug company.  They sell a drug,
     nicotine.  That's what they do. Next one.
          This is another document that brings us
     back to today, 1980.  They knew in 1980 that
     they can't defend free choice if a person was
     addicted, but you're going to hear about it
     today even though they have admitted that and
     they knew that.  They've known that for over
     30 years.
          Next page.
          They also knew with respect to nicotine
     that most of those -- they knew this in '82.
     Most of those who would like to stop are unable
     to do so.  Most people cannot quit.  They knew
     this.  So what they want to do is keep the
     maximum number of customers that they can have
     at any one time.
          So how do you maximize the number of
     customers you have?  Well, you've got two
     target audiences.  One is you have to do things
     so that the confirmed or addicted smokers keep
     smoking, the campaigns of doubt and all these
     things.
          Also you heard Mr. Corr talk about the
     coupon program.  That's aimed right at somebody
     they know is an addicted smoker.  Coupons, coupons, coupons, coupons, smoke, smoke, smoke,
     smoke.
          The other customers are the ones that
     haven't started yet.  So they have two target
     audiences, two key pieces of the puzzle for
     their profits.  One is the already addicted
     smokers and how you keep them smoking and the
     other is bringing new people -- which we're
     going to talk a lot about in a few minutes --
     into the fold.
          Next.
          Filters, a lie that caught the Surgeon
     General in 1966.  They know it's an illusion in
     1966, the illusion of filtration.  It doesn't
     mean anything, but it gives people a feeling of
     safety.  It doesn't mean anything, but it got
     to the point where even the Surgeon General,
     because he didn't have all their internal
     reports, even the Surgeon General thought it
     might be better for you.
          They pulled the illusion of filtration
     over the eyes not only of Gloria, but of the
     Surgeon General.
          Next page.
          This is again is the man that was inside walls of Philip Morris and I think
     you understand what he's talking about here.
     You can -- once you know the basic fact, which
     is an addicted person is going to get his dose
     of nicotine that he needs every day, a filter
     does not help if the person can still get the
     nicotine and tar they want out of it by smoking
     harder, smoking longer.
          They studied that and they knew that at
     the same time that they were telling the public
     it's okay, these are safe.
          Next.
          Here's an example of their internal
     investigation back as far as '61, their
     internal investigation that said in short, "I
     don't believe the smoking pattern has changed
     much, even with cancer scares and filter
     cigarettes."
          Next.
          They go beyond even the illusion of
     filtration, because in their documents they
     talk about -- you know, what are the new
     cigarettes going to look like.  "This a
     radically different method of filtration, but
     need not be any more effective." You know, this is a time, you know, when
     science was important.  Science was believed.
     They sort of preyed on the belief of science,
     because if you came out with something that was
     new, it's supposed to be better.
          This is in the '60s.  If it's new, it's
     better.  So we can come out with something new,
     people rely on it, but it doesn't matter if it
     actually works.  What we care about is selling
     cigarettes, not protecting its people.
          Next page.
          Now, this is 1975, another one of these
     internal studies where they basically came up
     with the same conclusion.
           You can go to the next page.
          There was no difference whether you smoked
     lights or smoked regular Marlboros.  People
     adjusted their intake to get the nicotine that
     they needed.
          Finally -- next slide -- to keep the
     battle going they needed more smokers.
     Starting in 1953 they had -- at least as early
     as that they had campaigns to get new smokers.
     Now, they called them sometimes "the youth
     market" or "youth adult market", but they know who the market is, because by their own records
     they know less than one-third of smokers start
     after age 18.
          Two-thirds of their replacement smokers
     are under age 18 and if they lose those
     replacement smokers, if they can't addict those
     replacement smokers, they are out of business,
     because there's nobody new coming in to buy
     their cigarettes and the people who are buying
     their cigarettes are dying.
          So -- and this is an RJR document.  So
     what do they do?  Let's talk a little about
     culture first.
          Go to the next.
          Remember that in the time period when
     Gloria was growing up there were a lot of ads
     glorifying cigarette smoking.  Remember, she
     was a cheerleader.  She went to the prom and
     she went to the beach.  She's their target.
          Next one.
          And for even littler kids you can get them
     thinking smoking is good, there's Santa Claus.
          Next one.
          So what does RJR -- this is 1984.  What do
     they say internally?  "Young adult smokers are shown to be critical to long term brand
     loyalty."  Now, we know what they mean because
     if they don't start smoking by 18, they lose
     two-thirds of their audience.
          Recommendations:  "Establish a separate
     young adult smoking program.  Attention to
     females."
          Attention to females, that's exactly what
     they did.  They payed attention to people like
     Gloria back in the '50s.
          Next page.
          They know by 1984 that cigarettes are
     killing people and yet they have a program to
     get more people hooked for long term
     profitability and they know those people --
     some of those people are going to die.  They
     know it.
          "Young adult smokers are the only source
     of replacement smokers."  Because if you can
     get past age 25 or so, you beat it.  You're
     probably -- your brain is mature enough to
     understand what health is really about.  You're
     not so worried about what you might look like
     in the parking lot behind school.  A lot of
     things happen in brain development, as we all know.  It's common sense.  By the time you're
     25 or 30 you're not as good a target as some
     girl who's a cheerleader who's 16 years old,
     who wants to be cool and go out back and have a
     cigarette.
          Next.
          They know they're going to kill people,
     but they commit manpower and money to that,
     commit a lot of manpower and money to do that.
     This is in 1984.
          What's interesting about this document --
     it's going to be on the suggested reading list,
     as you might guess -- what's interesting about
     this document is it's a retrospect.  They go
     back and talk about how these youth programs
     have worked in the past and they go all the way
     back --
          Next page.
          "Rising tide health concern peeked with
     the lung cancer scare of 1954."  Remember,
     that's when they started with the conspiracy.
          What was one of the ways they got around
     the cancer scare?  Modern filter cigarettes;
     even though they knew they were an illusion,
     even though they knew it didn't make anything safer.
          Next page.
          Again, Winston benefited from the health
     scare because it created the filter.  So
     whoever got to be first in the illusion of
     filters actually made money because of the
     cancer scare.
          Next.
          They even talk about how addressing social
     acceptability could revolutionize the youth
     market in '84, the same way filters did in the
     '50s.
          Next document.
          They aren't -- it's not enough for them
     that they're doing this planned marketing.
     They're mad that they're constrained from
     directly promoting cigarettes to the youth
     market, those 21 and under.  They want to be
     able to go directly to them.
          Why is this important to them?  Because
     without these people they're out of business.
     You have to have 15-year-olds, you have to have
     16-year-olds.  They've known this for 60 years.
          Next.
          What was the truth?  Some documents show truth.  They never came to light.
          1969, "We cannot take a position directly
     opposing cigarette forces and say that
     cigarettes are a contributor to good health.
     No information we have supports such a claim."
          But they didn't tell the public that
     and -- the next document -- they knew in 1968
     that they were lying.
          "Our basic position in the cigarette
     controversy" -- a controversy they created --
     "is subject to the charge and may be subject to
     a finding that we are making false or
     misleading statements to control the sale of
     cigarettes."
          Well, they finally got caught.  That's one
     of the reasons we're here today.
          So using all these weapons of PR, what
     happened to smoking?
          Next slide.
          During the time -- this is Gloria --
     smoking goes up, up, up, up, up, and right
     behind it what happens?  Remember, there's a
     lag time right behind it.  What happens?
     Cancer up, up, up, up, up.  Their campaign was
     successful.  The battles were successful.  In face of really no scientific opposition
     there were no real scientists saying this
     wasn't harmful.  They managed with this
     conspiracy to keep people smoking for 40 or 50
     more years and during that time they caused a
     lot more damage to people in this country,
     20 million deaths; and by selling a defective
     cigarette, by hiding the addiction, by lying
     about the filters, Gloria died.  She was one of
     those people.
          They didn't even do it voluntarily.  They
     had to be forced to do it.
          Those were the types of things, especially
     the filters that Gloria relied on -- when you
     get to that question about reliance, and I'll
     go through the verdict form -- if the Surgeon
     General relied on it, how could we expect
     Gloria not to have relied on it?
          Percentage of fault is something that you
     folks are going to get to decide.  I want you
     to look at all the evidence when you decide
     percentages of fault.  I'm not going to tell
     you what they should be.  This is your
     decision.  You get to decide what the
     percentage of fault should be. But look at all the evidence and remember
     how do you land a 14-year-old?  If you believe
     she was addicted, she lost her choice, how do
     you blame a 14-year-old?
          That takes us now to an entirely different
     part of this case and that is, what did all
     this do to Mr. Gore -- hang on one second.
          Bob?  Say hi.
          MR. GORE:  Hi.
          MR. FOOTE:  What did this do to Mr. Gore?
     This is again for you to figure out, what it
     did to him.
          In this country, you know, we don't kill
     somebody else -- and I know it's a hard thing
     to do, but you turn what happened to them into
     dollars, that's how our system works, and
     that's a decision you're going to have to make.
          What dollars are fair for what he went
     through?  I want to talk about three things,
     three separate areas that he went through.
          First is when she got sick -- let me take
     a step back.  You have to start with what was
     the relationship like.  That's what's
     important.
          What was he going to lose when the relationship ended either because she was sick
     or she died?
          I was struck by his comment of their bond,
     and I think that some people have that in their
     life and some people haven't.  But it's a very
     powerful thing.  If you have that bond with
     someone, that's your partner in life.  That's
     something you can't replace.  You can't replace
     a person if you have that kind of bond.  So I
     think we start with that.
          I think, you know, he's honest to a fault,
     as you guys saw.  You're not going to get any
     untruths out of Bob Gore.  He's honest to a
     fault, and one of the things I think you know
     for sure is there was an incredible bond
     between them.  They were sort of yin and yang.
          They loved going places together, loved
     doing a lot of things.  They raised a family.
     He adopted the child that she had with someone
     else and he became her father.  That's the sort
     of man he is, and she thinks that's her dad.
          So given that background, when he had to
     shave his head, I think that's a great image of
     a bond.  "If you're losing your hair, I'm
     losing my hair.  If you need me to carry you to bathroom, I'll carry you.  If you need me
     to clean you out, I will do it because we are
     bonded.  You know that if the situation was
     reversed, you would do the same for me."
          So what he went through in that time
     period before she passed is part of what you
     have to figure out.  How do you value that?
          The second part is his total collapse, his
     total pain collapse after she was gone.  Here's
     a man who was in the service, worked for Piper,
     was a postman delivering on a route in Vero for
     many years, never in any trouble with the law,
     never any trouble with drugs or any never
     trouble with alcohol, and when she passed, as
     you heard from the whole family, he fell apart.
          A measure of the bond is how he fell
     apart.  He drank too much.  He almost lost his
     job.  He became withdrawn, he became depressed,
     and finally his youngest daughter had to say,
     "Dad, it's time.  We need you to go and get
     yourself better."  And to his credit, he did.
     He had to get locked up because his wife died.
          Now, that's a bond.  He still -- he was
     never on any medication before.  He's still on
     medication, years later, 14 years later. The life tables are in evidence and you
     can figure out how much time they should have
     had together.  That's the purpose of them.  How
     much time should they have had together, it's
     just arithmetic.  It's not hard to figure out.
     They've lost about 23 or 24 years that they
     should have had together where they didn't get
     that bond.
          That's why the life tables are in
     evidence, because without -- what the life
     tables tell you is that without cigarettes
     killing her, she would be here today.
          So in my view it's about 25 years for all
     the stuff they went through.  For those 25
     years for what he lost, what he went through,
     shaving his head, going, as he called it, into
     the booby hatch.  You should award him
     $7.5 million for going through that and for
     what he's still going through going forward.
          You're also going to be asked to look at
     the punitive claim.  You're not deciding
     anything about a number, just deciding whether
     or not there should be punitive damages.
          Why should there be punitive damages?
     Number one reason, they knew what they were doing and these documents show that they knew
     what they were doing.  This didn't happen --
     this wasn't happenstance.  They knew what they
     were doing and especially with respect to the
     "replacement smokers", they knew that those
     replacement smokers, many of them were going to
     die.
          Gloria was right in the middle of this
     conspiracy.  From 1953 till 2000 it affected
     her as much as it affected any American,
     because she had the conspiracy from the
     beginning to the end and she never knew what we
     know today.  She never knew any of this because
     it was all hidden, and that's why you should
     tell us that we should proceed to the punitive
     damages phase.
          Finally, as you know, there's going to be
     a verdict form when you do your deliberations.
     I'm going to put them on the Elmo and I'm going
     to make my suggestion to you in order to fully
     find for the plaintiff, this is how you should
     fill out the verdict form.
          First question you should answer yes, as
     Mr. Corr talked to you about.
          Second question you should answer yes for both defendants.
          Next question -- and we talked about all
     these things.
          Third question, reliance.  Think about
     filters and the Surgeon General and you should
     answer yes.
          I don't think they can see that exactly,
     Josh.  You can't see the numbers.  Can we go
     down a little bit more and then more --
     whatever that way is -- there we go.
          Third question, think about the Surgeon
     General.  He lied.  So both three and four, you
     should answer yes to those questions.
          Next question, Josh.
          That's for you.  Take all the evidence
     into account.  We've admitted it's partly her
     fault, somewhat her fault.  They haven't.  It's
     shared responsibility for what happened and you
     tell them how the responsibility should be
     shared.
          The damages, as I said, $7.5 million.
          And the final question on punitive
     damages, Number 7.  Again, you should tell us
     that punitive damages are warranted here
     because of the fact that their cigarettes were defective.  They lied about the filters and
     Gloria was caught right in the middle of this
     conspiracy.
          Thank you for your time.


          MR. CORR:  Can I just have two minutes?  I
     don't need a break.  I just need to get some
     slides set up.
          THE COURT:  Is everyone okay?
          He's not going to be more than 30 minutes,
     just in case you're wondering.
          MR. CORR:  That came from you, not from
     me.
          THE COURT:  Maybe 31. JUROR BUSH:  We're hoping for 28.
          MR. CORR:  I'll try to get it done shorter
     than that.
          So ladies and gentlemen, you've seen this
     document before.  Josh, if I could pull that
     up.
          Doubt is their product, right?  That's
     what you just heard them do --
          MR. MCCARTER:  Objection.
          THE COURT:  Can you approach?
          (Whereupon counsel for the respective
     parties approached the bench and the following
     proceedings were had outside the presence of
     the jury:)
          THE COURT:  There was nothing on my
     screen.  What is your objection?
          MR. MCCARTER:  That he can't compare us or
     the defense in the case to what he's claiming
     is fraud in the past.  It's improper.  He's
     saying that's what they did in this courtroom.
          MR. CORR:  There's just passing down --
          THE COURT:  You can't do that.  You've
     already called them on the report and you
     pointed out the doubt, but you can't cast
     aspersions on them. MR. CORR:  I wasn't casting aspersions on
     them.
          THE COURT:  Sustained.
          (Whereupon the following proceedings were
     had within the presence of the jury:)
          MR. CORR:  So first of all, Josh, can you
     pull up the list.
          Mr. Foote forgot to give you his reading
     list, but it happens to be a lot of the
     documents that they talked about in their
     closing.  So I'm going to put up on the board
     here a reading list for you.  It's going to
     have -- well, you can't see it very well.
          There you go.  So these are some of the
     documents that you're going to have back there.
     It's a reading list for you.  It's going to
     give you the road map of what happened here,
     okay.
          You're going to see the forwarding memo.
     TL07705 is a forwarding memo that talks about
     the plan.  Read the whole document.  We're
     happy you're going to read their documents.
     It's in their words.
          TL1818 talks about the psychology of us
     and what they were trying to do with people's psychology.  Read it.  We're happy to have you
     read it.
          TL1822, digging their own grave.  They say
     that they're digging their own grave in this,
     okay.  If good science gets out through the
     TIRC, they're digging their own grave.  That's
     what they're saying.  Read the document.
          2759, Teague, the role of nicotine.  Very
     important document.  We're happy to have you
     read the whole thing.  Read through it.  It's
     great reading, okay.
          2928, RJR on smoking.  Again, another
     Teague document.  It's great reading.
          I'm going to start with some of the
     comments that Mr. Walker made in his closing.
     You know, he started talking about well, you
     know, plaintiffs, they just put some documents
     on and then they cull things out.  You're going
     to have all those documents.  You have every
     single one of the documents.  We're happy to
     have you read all of the documents.  We're just
     pointing sought some things.
          It's not like taking two clips from a day
     of a deposition in front of nine people in a
     hotel room with a camera in your face and you take a couple of questions and answers and you
     never put one up where the man said she was
     addicted and she could not beat it and she
     fought her whole life.  They didn't show you
     that.  They took in these little clips from two
     days in a hotel room.
          As he said, you know, it's pretty scary.
     There's nine guys sitting there asking you
     questions, they got a camera in your face and
     you're trying to do the best you can.
          That's what they did.  We're giving you
     all the documents.  We put them in evidence.
     We did that.  It's for you to read, okay.
     We're happy for you to read everything.
          You know, it's funny, because Mr. Walker
     said that and then he pulled out a couple of
     little things.  He says they give you this and
     then they pull out a couple of little things
     right under the sentences you're reading,
     underneath what he was highlighting, because it
     said "we must get our share of the youth
     market."  That's what it says.  Go read it.
     It's right in the document.
          He highlighted one line.  Just go a couple
     of lines right below it.  "We must get our share of the youth market."
          There was another thing in there, "We must
     make brands designed to be particularly
     attractive to young smokers."  It's right in
     there, okay.
          That same document.  He showed some
     things, right.  Josh, pull up 52.
          Now, this is 2771, okay.  Happy to have
     you read the whole document.  It's right in
     there.
          We're never going to get 30 minutes if
     these don't start coming up.  Looks like we're
     having computer trouble.
          So right in here he started pointing out
     little different pieces.  He says we're
     pointing out little pieces, but he didn't show
     you the beginning of it.  "At the outset, it
     should be said that we are presently and I
     believe unfairly constrained from directly
     promoting cigarettes to the youth market".
          Which is what they do.  They're saying
     it's unfair we're no longer allowed to do that.
          Read the document.  It says it right in
     there.  They said they thought it was unfair
     that they weren't allowed to sell it to youth for years.  But it's a retrospective.  It talks
     about in the 1950s, when Mrs. Gore started
     smoking.  It's exactly what they were doing.
          You know why?  She's exactly the person
     they targeted.  She was the one, okay.  They
     want to say well, they have to prove to you it
     was all about her.  You know how we know it,
     because they only showed you two things that
     were mailed back.
          They showed you one little thing from
     Gloria Gore, then they showed one from Robert
     Gore after his wife was dead, and what did he
     say?  Free is good.  I don't care when you get
     it, free is good.  I agree with him, free is
     good, except this document right here.
          Here, this is Gore 144.  It's a 16-page
     spreadsheet showing all the time that they
     directly mailed things to her.  They mailed it
     to customer 11006902.  They didn't care about
     Gloria Gore.  They didn't care one hoot about
     her.  But what they did do is they tracked it.
          They said we didn't show you anything
     about brand usage.  Dr. Burns told you, they
     told you.  We can't do cumulative evidence.  We
     can't keep showing the same things.  He told you from 1963 to 1970 she smoked RJR
     cigarettes.  From 1970 to 2000, those 30 years,
     Philip Morris cigarettes.
          Philip Morris tracked it.  They tracked
     everything she was doing.  This starts in 1993.
     Benson & Hedges, Benson & Hedges, Benson &
     Hedges.  You'll see it in here.  Take a look at
     it.  The whole document is right there, okay.
     They asked her questions.
          They didn't show you these, right, but
     they asked her questions to get stuff free if
     she would just respond.  What other brands did
     you smoke?  It's in here.  Kools, Belair is
     mentioned, okay.  They're in their records.
          And what were they doing?  Well, let's
     see.  On March 26 of 1998 they sent her the
     Benson & Hedges April direct mailing, right?
     She responded December 17th of 1998.  Before
     that she got $2 off a carton, okay.  They did
     it.  They started that when she was youth.  You
     can see it in the documents.  In the 50s they
     targeted her.  In the '90s they were still
     doing it.
          As a matter of fact, they did it after she
     was dead, because they were mailing stuff to her after she was dead from their product.
     You'll see it right in this document.  Gore
     144, 16 pages of it.
          They talk about addiction.  I mean, we
     have a woman who is smoking their product.
     It's got nicotine it in.  They know that
     nicotine is highly addictive.  Look at their
     documents.  It's right in there.  It's in some
     of the reading list you have.
          Don't limit yourself to that reading list.
     I'm telling you there's a lot of documents
     here.  Read them.  It's great stuff, because it
     shows the testing that they were doing.  It
     shows they weren't going to tell her.
          They had an agreement in 1953, all these
     cigarette companies are going to work together,
     every one of them.  Their documents are stamped
     confidential.  It's not from each other.  It's
     from Mrs. Gore, it's from you, it's from
     everybody in America.  It's from the Surgeon
     General.  They didn't have the information.
     They didn't give it to them.
          They said well, we gave them this list of
     carcinogens and we published it.  They didn't
     show you where they published it.  They didn't publish anything.
          They showed you Readers Digest and Life
     Magazine and whenever they showed an article
     that was out in the public, they put it down.
          They came out up a statement other than
     that.  When the Surgeon General gave a press
     conference in 1964 to announce this big thing,
     they preempted it.  They had a press
     conference.  Before it went on the news they
     took half the time in the news show to say how
     good they were and how good smoking was and
     that it wasn't going to help you.
          And they promised over and over -- 1954,
     January 1954 in the Frank Statement, it's in
     evidence, you'll see it -- they promised there.
     "We do everything that's good for you.  It
     doesn't hurt you.  We say it's not injurious to
     your health."
          They publicly said if, if -- and you saw
     this Cullman, Cullman the elder in '64 and
     Cullman the younger in '71 -- they went on TV
     and said "if we ever find anything that's
     injurious to your health, we'll remove it."
     That's what they said.
          That's the promise they made to Mrs. Gore. That's the lie they made to her throughout the
     time she was smoking.
          Mr. Cullman, it's interesting, they talk
     about she didn't stop smoking when she was
     pregnant right in the 60s and then in the 70s.
     She didn't stop smoking.  She smoked when she
     was pregnant.  She didn't even try.
          Well, guess what, they didn't even -- they
     weren't even forced to put the warning on the
     cigarette packs until 1985 that it affected
     pregnancy --
          MR. MCCARTER:  Objection, Your Honor,
     preemption.
          THE COURT:  Sustained.
          MR. CORR:  Their evidence, not mine.
     Their suggestion, their argument.  In 1985 is
     when these warnings started to go on.  That's
     from them, okay.
          In '66, didn't mention pregnancy.  Earlier
     than that, didn't mention pregnancy.  They
     could have put it on.  If they were so
     concerned about Gloria Gore and her pregnancy,
     they could have put it on at any time, because
     they had the information.  They didn't give it
     to her. But what they did do?  What they did do,
     they went on national television with their CEO
     who said what?  He said, "Well, I read that
     report about women and pregnancy and babies and
     I agree that babies might be smaller, but
     they're just as healthy -- they're just as
     healthy as other babies and guess what, some
     women just like to have smaller babies."
          That's what they said.  They didn't care
     about Mrs. Gore.  She was a customer number.
          They spent a lot of time talking about
     what she knew, what Mrs. Gore knew, and they
     said oh, you know, plaintiff's counsel told you
     that she didn't know.  That's not what we said
     at all.
          As a matter of fact, in the beginning of
     this trial in opening statement we said we
     accept responsibility on behalf of Mrs. Gore.
     We accept that responsibility.  They don't.
          We're asking you to assign a percentage of
     their share of responsibility.  She knew,
     there's no doubt about it.  The evidence is she
     knew a lot of things.  There was all kind of
     discussion going on.  But what they were doing
     is hiding that knowledge to keep her addicted, not that they were adding things.
          We say they added nicotine.  We never said
     they added nicotine or spiked their cigarettes
     or anything like that.  What we do know is they
     had the technology.  In fact, we used the
     technology.  We removed the nicotine.  They
     removed it during the process.
          I mean, that comes from Dr. Farone and
     Dr. Cook.  Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds
     remove the nicotine and then they spray it back
     on before they sell it to you.
          They could have kept it out.  They could
     have chosen to keep that out, but they didn't,
     and when they did put something out on the
     market that had no nicotine in it or very,
     very, very low nicotine, when they did put
     something like that out in the market they
     chose to pull it from the market because it
     wasn't making them enough money and they chose
     to keep selling people the addicted substance,
     right?
          When people are addicted -- I mean,
     addiction is a terrible thing.  It's a terrible
     thing, no matter what the substance is you're
     addicted to.  It's a terrible thing and when people that are giving you the addictive
     substance keep telling you how good it is --
     you know, it relaxes you, you're relaxed by the
     cigarette -- no, you're relaxed by the drug
     we're giving you.
          It calms you.  No, it doesn't.  The drug
     that we're giving you calms you.  It's exactly
     what they wanted.  They targeted her.  She was
     the one.
          A lot of talk about she didn't want to
     quit.  I mean, who goes to hypnosis if you
     don't want to quit?  Who goes and gets needles
     stuck throughout your body in acupuncture if
     you don't want to quit?  Who goes on a
     prescription medication if you don't want to
     quit.
          They pulled up the board where Dr. Beckett
     said, I clearly remember, "She wasn't
     motivated."  In 1992 that's what he says.
          When he sees her in 1999, she's on Zyban.
     How can he not think she's motivated in 1999?
     She's on a prescription drug to stop.
          I'm just going to read through some of my
     notes here.
          Mr. Gore filed this lawsuit, not Mrs. Gore.  You know why?  Mrs. Gore was dead
     two months after she was diagnosed with lung
     cancer.  She didn't bring the lawsuit, I agree.
     I don't think it was the main focus of her time
     left with her family.
          They spent an awful lot of time saying
     there's no evidence that Mrs. Gore saw this, no
     evidence that Mrs. Gore saw that.  She didn't
     hear or see anything, right?  Then they talk
     about there were these articles out there.
     Everybody saw this, everybody saw that.
     Everything that was out there that they didn't
     show you, the clips they didn't show you said
     that they were making statements just the
     opposite of what was going out to the public.
          They talked about Dr. Farone.  Dr. Farone
     at one point said something about filters
     reducing the risk of smoking.  Well, what they
     didn't point out was that Dr. Farone also said
     he never saw all the documents.  He wasn't
     allowed to see them.
          They asked for them.  He asked to see the
     documents and he wasn't allowed to see them;
     their own employee, the guy that's supposed to
     be researching for them.  He's not allowed to see the documents.
          On the reading list you should also add
     TL -- I don't know if this was already on
     there, 1683 and 1789.  This has to do with
     filters.  Because they didn't really care about
     the filtration, right?  They knew it wasn't
     working.  They studied it, it didn't work, but
     what was important is the illusion of
     filtration.
          That's what's important.  The illusion of
     filtration is as important as the fact of
     filtration.  Doesn't matter if it actually
     works, as long as people believe that it works.
          And how do we know that Mrs. Gore did?
     Mr. Walker said, you know, there's no evidence
     that she changed her smoking habits because of
     filters.  She smoked filters all the time.  She
     never smoked non-filters.  You know why?
     Because out of the testimony you heard was in
     1994 there was a discussion around her father
     dying because he smoked Lucky Strike
     unfiltered, right.
          They said then Lucky Strikes will kill
     you.  Then Lucky Strikes will kill you.  And
     you know what?  Mrs. Gore's response was, "But I smoke filters.  I smoke filters, not like
     daddy.  I have the safer thing," and Mr. Gore
     said she felt it was her safety net.  They told
     her it was.  That's how they advertised it.
     That's how they promoted it.  That's what they
     kept from her.
          You know what they gave her, they gave her
     the illusion of filtration.  They can't give
     her actual filtration, because that doesn't
     matter as much.
          You know how you know that, because of
     point 11.  This is 1683.  Read the whole
     document.  I agree I'm blowing one part out.
          Number 11 says, "Any entry should be by a
     radically different method."  So we can say
     charcoal is in it, we can say cotton, we can
     say this, paper, whatever it is, any method of
     filtration, but it need not be any more
     effective because the illusion is the important
     part, not the effect.
          We know they had done studies.  We know in
     1799, this was already shown to you, and in
     1799 they talk about -- this is the Marlboro
     light study and it talks about -- I'm not going
     to find it all, but you can read the document. It talks about people puffing harder.
          There are documents in there that will
     talk about smoking compensation, and that's
     what they're talking about.  If we put
     something on that makes it harder to inhale, as
     Mr. Cook said on the stand, if we do that
     people will compensate their smoking to get
     more nicotine, and that's why Dr. Cook said
     they needed consistency across the product.
     You needed to keep them brand loyal, which she
     was.  She was brand loyal and they needed her
     to stay that way.
          There was some talk about cause and "the"
     cause.  Remember, there's no expert for the
     defense.  They didn't bring anybody in to say
     that Mrs. Gore did not have carotid stenosis.
     They didn't bring anybody to say that the
     carotid stenosis was not caused by the
     addiction, and it's important to look at the
     jury instruction.  It has to be a legal cause
     not "the", a legal cause.
          There can be other things, okay, and I
     want to point that out because the document
     that they used, right -- Josh, this is 64212 --
     you'll have the whole document, but Mr. McCarter in his closing, he talked about
     the 11 things, right?
          Unhealthy blood cholesterol, one level of
     it one time in 1988 after her morning routine,
     okay, she has an elevated blood cholesterol of
     258.  No question about it, right.
          Next thing -- he didn't talk about any of
     these.  He didn't go through these list of
     11 things.
          High blood pressure, look at the medical
     records.  She has no hypertension.  Now he's
     pointing to her family.  Oh, her family has
     hypertension.  She didn't.  She didn't.  Look
     at the medical records.
          That's what Dr. Burns said, there's no
     relevant family history here.  That's what
     Dr. Burns said.  He didn't say there's none.
     He said there's no relevant family history.
     Because she has this one -- and he didn't
     consider that even relevant, the one
     cholesterol, because you didn't know if it was
     fasting.  You didn't know what were the
     effects, what happened at the time of the
     testing.  You don't even have all the data.
     You take just a single cholesterol. You'll see here this cholesterol, it talks
     about the HDL and the LDL and how they're
     broken down.  That's what the thing is.
          But what do we know?  No high blood
     pressure.
          We know the next thing is smoking, smoking
     can damage the blood vessels.  It leads to
     unhealthy cholesterol levels.
          So in 1988 she's been smoking for
     something like 30 years at that point every
     day, a pack and a half to two packs a day.  Of
     course she's going to have an elevated
     cholesterol level when she wakes up in the
     morning, has coffee and smokes cigarettes,
     okay.
          Insulin resistance is another risk factor
     for carotid stenosis.  No risk factor for that.
     She doesn't have that.
          Diabetes, she doesn't have diabetes.  It's
     not in the medical records.  Her mother was
     borderline diabetic, that's in the medical
     record, but she doesn't.
          It doesn't say family history of diabetes.
     It says "does the patient have diabetes," no.
          Overweight or obese, you'll see she wasn't overweight or obese.  She was something like
     5'1", 102 pounds.  Look in the medical records.
     It's all in there.
          Metabolic syndrome, she doesn't have
     metabolic syndrome.
          Then it goes down to family history of
     atherosclerosis.  Doesn't talk about the family
     history of atherosclerosis.  Maybe there is one
     mention about something like that, but look at
     the records.  I'm happy to have you look at all
     those medical records.
          The fact is she did have carotid stenosis
     and it was caused by her addiction to
     cigarettes and even if family history was a
     contributing factor, cigarettes contributed to
     her high cholesterol.  It says so in a document
     they showed you.
          The lung cancer -- Josh, can you pull up
     Dr. Scott's record again?
          Again, Mr. McCarter went on and on about
     the pleural and Dr. Burns says this about
     pleural, the right -- the pleura has two sides.
     One covers the inside of the lung, one
     obviously is the casing.  So the other half is
     the outside of the lung.  So he talked about well, he doesn't say it's in the lung.
          Josh, do you have that one?
          MR. GALE:  I don't have that one.
          MR. CORR:  It's my slide.
          So there was this thing about the one and
     a half centimeter.  I don't even know the size
     of the thing that Dr. Burns said was not the
     tumor, right.  He told you it's not the tumor.
     They said it wasn't the tumor.  All the
     treating doctors said it wasn't the tumor.
          But Dr. Scott, who is the oncologist,
     hematologist, the specialist in cancer who
     treated Mrs. Gore, on the initial patient
     evaluation says "the tumor," "the tumor".  They
     didn't think it was that little thing either.
          The tumor in the lung -- in the lung,
     right -- measures 4.5 by 2.5 centimeters, the
     very thing that Mr. McCarter put on the board.
     I think he wrote Dr. Burns with an arrow to it.
     That's it.  That's what Dr. Burns is talking
     about right here, "The tumor in the lung
     measures this size."  Where?  Where does it
     measure that?  In the left lung.  Appears to be
     pleural based, just like Dr. Burns said.
          So we can go over and over this again. You have this whole document there.  You can
     read all the medical records you want.  Every
     single doctor in Vero Beach who treated
     Mrs. Gore, every single one of them says she
     had adenocarcinoma of the lung.  Of the lung,
     in the lung.  It is lung cancer.  It started
     there.  It's adenocarcinoma and it metastasized
     to two places that they talk about or three
     places, actually.
          It metastasized to the bone, which is, you
     know, in the arm, the humerus, in the ilium, in
     the hip area.  It talks about in the hips.  As
     Dr. Burns described it, breaks through the lung
     and out to the rib and eats away.  That's what
     the lytic lesion is.  It's eating away the
     bone.  It can't be started there, because it's
     adenocarcinoma.  It couldn't have started
     there.
          So it either has to have started in the
     lung -- which it did, we know it did, that's
     what they treated -- or on the bone, and it
     couldn't have, because it's adenocarcinoma and
     then it metastasized to the bone, to the
     adrenals and to the brain, okay.
          And then this stuff about the death certificate, I mean, you'll have the death
     certificate.  I'll tell you, it's 4002.  Take a
     look at it.  To say that this was caused by
     cancer in the bone is absurd, okay.  She died
     immediately.  The immediate cause was the
     brain, because the metastasis to the brain
     stopped the brain from functioning.  That's the
     immediate cause.
          It's just like, you know, if somebody dies
     of old age, they don't say they died of old
     age.  They say they died of cardiac arrest,
     because the heart stopped.  That's what
     happens.
          So on this death certificate she died from
     brain metastasis; not from brain cancer, from
     brain metastasis.  Then the second -- this is
     the second thing, is she had primary lung
     cancer, right, bronchogenic lung cancer.  I
     forget the exact wording on it.  Lung cancer.
          Then the third thing that she had at that
     time was metastatic bone cancer.  But that's
     the thing about that comment, is that it says
     bone metastasis.  It doesn't say bone cancer.
     It says bone metastasis.  And she did have
     that, we know she had it. But it does say "carcinoma, left lung
     non-small cell."  Doesn't say metastatic cancer
     in the lung.  It says that it was the carcinoma
     in the lung.
          So ladies and gentlemen, when you go back
     there and you have your verdict form, please
     take a look at all the records, okay.  Look at
     all their records.  Look at what they said.
     Look at what they knew and didn't tell
     Mrs. Gore.  Look at what they withheld from
     her.
          Ask yourselves this.  If they had removed
     the nicotine like they could, they didn't spray
     it back there, if they didn't put it back there
     would anybody smoke cigarettes?  Would anybody
     inhale carcinogens into their lung?  If they
     didn't get you addicted to the nicotine, would
     you do it?
          Right?  If they didn't target her with all
     those mail-ins over and over again, would she
     smoke their brands?  Would she have smoked
     their brands if they didn't give her free
     stuff?
          The only way to get coupons -- the only
     way to get the coupons is if they mailed you them or if you bought their cartons of
     cigarettes.  That's the only way to do that.
     So they want you to have coupons and they
     targeted her.
          In 1953 they all got together, every one
     of these CEOs, right.  They met up there in New
     York City and they decided from that point
     forward they were going to start to target
     people.  They were going to target them by
     groups, and you'll see the groups they
     targeted.
          They targeted youth, they targeted
     females.  They targeted a lot of different
     groups.  She was right in the targeted group.
     She was young as a teenager in high school.
     She started smoking, they kept her addicted.
     They kept manipulating those cigarettes.  They
     kept developing better and better cigarettes.
     They kept advertising new fangled things, new
     filters, different filters.  It didn't matter.
     It was all an illusion.  It was all an illusion
     to keep her addicted, to keep her buying their
     products.
          Even though there was this knowledge out
     there and everybody admits she had some knowledge, she has some responsibility -- she
     definitely does and we've said it from the
     beginning -- so do they.  This is a shared
     responsibility, okay.  All we're doing is
     asking you to tell Philip Morris and tell R.J.
     Reynolds what's their share of the
     responsibility, because Mrs. Gore, she paid an
     awful price for this and so did Mr. Gore.  He
     paid an awful price.
          He said addiction is an awful thing.  It
     has awful consequences for people.  In this
     case Mrs. Gore lost her life.  Mr. Gore lost
     the love of his life.  He didn't have life with
     her for 25 years that he would have otherwise
     had, okay.  They didn't get to share time
     together with their grandchildren and great
     grandchildren and they didn't get the
     opportunity to retire like they planned and go
     travel and do things.
          She was 60 years old when she was dead,
     60 years old.  45 of her 60 years were spent
     smoking, because that's what they --
          MR. MCCARTER:  Excuse me, I just object to
     going over the allotted time.
          MR. CORR:  I'm just finishing up, Your Honor.
          That's what they wanted.  They wanted her
     to continue smoking.  They knew it was going to
     hurt her.  They knew as much as she did, but
     they had more information.  So when they talk
     about her smoking choices, ask yourself this.
     Was she able to make an informed choice?
          They're the good ones, right?  They held
     all the information.  They just couldn't access
     it.  You know why, because it was stamped
     confidential.
          So I would ask that you go back to the
     jury room, you read all the documents.  Take
     your time, review it.  It will be clear to you
     the decision you're going to make.  She was
     definitely addicted to nicotine and cigarettes.
          Mrs. Gore had carotid stenosis, it was
     definitely caused by the addiction to
     cigarettes.  That addiction was a legal cause
     of her carotid stenosis.
          She had lung cancer, there's no question
     from the medical records you'll see.  There was
     no question by any of those doctors, only
     questions by lawyers in this courtroom,
     questions to doctors, no question she had primary lung cancer and it was caused by her
     addiction to cigarettes.
          They say, well, we shouldn't be punished
     for these five things I just put up on the
     board.  We did good things.
          We're not punishing them for those five
     things.  It's for the 47 years of lies that
     they need to be punished --
          THE COURT:  All right, 34 minutes.
          MR. CORR:  Thank you for your attention
     and I'm sorry I went over the time.
