5             MS. PARKER:  May it please the Court?               
02:55:01
6             Mr. Graham, and counsel, and ladies and gentlemen   
02:55:09
7  of the jury, hello again.                                      
02:55:12
8             I'm so appreciative.  And I want to join Mr. Byrd   
02:55:14
9  in thanking you for your service as jurors.  My whole team     
02:55:19
10  wants to thank you.  You-all have been here for over a week    
02:55:23
11  now.  And we know you've been paying attention.                
02:55:25
12             And I hope at the end of all this that you will     
02:55:30
13  believe that you have enjoyed your service.  It was a real     
02:55:33
14  sacrifice, we know, for you to be here, and we appreciate it   
02:55:35
15  very much. 02:55:38
16             Now, when I started last Monday -- and remember     
02:55:42
17  that was the other time that I had a chance to talk directly   
02:55:44
18  with you.  And when we started last Monday, I asked you then,  
02:55:47
19  I said, this case is only about one smoker.  Remember I said   
02:55:51
20  that?  I said throughout the trial, please try to keep your    
02:55:55
21  attention just on this one smoker.                             
02:55:59
22             That is what we are here about.  We are only about  
02:56:02
23  one smoker, and that's Mrs. Graham.                            
02:56:07
24             Now, what did you hear at trial about Mrs. Graham?  
02:56:09
25  What did her family members say?                               
02:56:14 210
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
1             Remember her daughter said, I knew mama was going   
02:56:16
2  to do what mama wanted to do about smoking.                    
02:56:20
3             And remember that when Mr. Graham told her about    
02:56:24
4  quitting, Mrs. Graham, according to him, just looked at him    
02:56:27
5  and laughed.  02:56:31
6             Remember Mr. Graham said, Nobody forced the         
02:56:33
7  cigarettes on her. 02:56:36
8             The testimony was unequivocal that she liked to     
02:56:38
9  smoke.  She enjoyed smoking.  And when people told her --      
02:56:42
10  when her family members told her that smoking had health       
02:56:46
11  risks and that she should quit, she told them to mind their    
02:56:51
12  own business. 02:56:56
13             She called her cigarettes cancer sticks.  And even  
02:56:57
14  after she got sick with cancer, she never blamed, she was      
02:57:00
15  never angry with the tobacco companies.                        
02:57:04
16             Some people like to smoke cigarettes, and they      
02:57:06
17  have that right to do it here in the United States.  Some      
02:57:11
18  people just enjoy smoking.  Some people like to smoke.  They   
02:57:13
19  can quit if they want to, but they don't want to quit because  
02:57:18
20  they enjoy it. 02:57:21
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
21             And Mrs. Graham had the right here in the           
02:57:22
22  United States to make that decision for herself.               
02:57:24
23             Now, most of the testimony that you heard during    
02:57:27
24  the trial -- in fact, they put up one witness, Dr. Cummings,   
02:57:32
25  who didn't talk about Mrs. Graham at all.  Most of the         
02:57:36 211
1  testimony that you heard from them at trial had absolutely     
02:57:40
2  nothing to do with Mrs. Graham.                                
02:57:43
3             It's distraction testimony, to keep you from being  
02:57:45
4  focused on the facts of Mrs. Graham.                           
02:57:50
5             But this case is only about her.  And every         
02:57:53
6  question on the verdict form asks about Mrs. Graham, whether   
02:57:57
7  she was aware of the health risks of smoking, her life, what   
02:58:02
8  she wanted to do with her life.                                
02:58:07
9             And so to decide the questions on the verdict       
02:58:10
10  form, I would like to respectfully suggest that what you need  
02:58:14
11  to do is to focus on Mrs. Graham and the facts of her life.    
02:58:17
12             Ladies and gentlemen, our witnesses in this trial   
02:58:22
13  are the facts.  All those facts that are in the medical        
02:58:28
14  records, that her daughter admitted, that Mr. Graham           
02:58:33
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
15  admitted, the facts are our witnesses.                         
02:58:37
16             If anybody -- Mr. Byrd said something about our     
02:58:39
17  not calling witnesses.  If anybody goes back in the jury room  
02:58:44
18  and anybody has a concern about that, Judge Treadwell himself  
02:58:47
19  is going to tell you -- and this is a jury instruction that    
02:58:50
20  you are going to hear from the Court when the Court gives you  
02:58:53
21  the jury instructions. 02:58:56
22             The number of witnesses testifying concerning any   
02:58:57
23  particular dispute is not controlling.                         
02:59:01
24             Now, throughout this whole trial, what's been       
02:59:03
25  happening is they have been telling this story that doesn't    
02:59:09 212
1  fit the facts of Mrs. Graham's life.                           
02:59:12
2             And you-all have heard a lot since you've been      
02:59:17
3  here last Monday, but what I have tried to do for you this     
02:59:19
4  afternoon is to boil all that down so that you'll have -- I    
02:59:23
5  can go over with you and you'll have with you when you go      
02:59:28
6  back to deliberate the information that you need to be able    
02:59:30
7  to answer those questions on the verdict form.                 
02:59:34
8             After everything you've heard in this trial, I      
02:59:37
9  would like to respectfully submit that it all boils down to    
02:59:41
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
10  five simple truths about Mrs. Graham that I would like to go   
02:59:45
11  over with you. 02:59:50
12             Here is Truth No. 1:  Mrs. Graham knew the risks    
02:59:50
13  of smoking. 02:59:58
14             This is a woman who was intelligent.  She kept up   
02:59:59
15  with current affairs.  There is no doubt whatsoever that she   
03:00:03
16  knew that smoking was dangerous.  But what they have tried to  
03:00:06
17  do in their efforts to get $6 million is to come in here and   
03:00:10
18  repackage her in a way that doesn't fit the facts about her    
03:00:15
19  life. 03:00:20
20             Now, she passed away in 1993.  And, of course,      
03:00:24
21  that was 20 years ago. 03:00:28
22             Mr. Graham testified he had -- when I asked him     
03:00:30
23  here, he said it again in court, that even though warnings     
03:00:34
24  were on every package she smoked, starting in 1966,            
03:00:38
25  Mr. Graham said, right there on the witness stand, that        
03:00:44 213
1  Mrs. Graham did not really know about the health risks of      
03:00:47
2  smoking. 03:00:52
3             Okay.  What are the facts, our witnesses, what are  
03:00:54
4  the facts about that?  03:00:57
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
5             MR. BYRD:  Objection.  Disclosure.  I believe the   
03:00:59
6  rule is clear. 03:01:06
7             THE COURT:  You are talking about the               
03:01:07
8  demonstrative? 03:01:08
9             MR. BYRD:  Right.                                   
03:01:09
10             MS. PARKER:  We have had no requirement about       
03:01:12
11  exchanging any kind of demonstratives.  I've got nothing from  
03:01:15
12  them.  We had no discussion about that at all.                 
03:01:20
13             MR. BYRD:  Exactly.  We haven't seen anything.      
03:01:22
14  We have used exhibits was all -- we were going to use the      
03:01:27
15  verdict form and jury instruction.  We didn't get any          
03:01:29
16  disclosure of this, I don't believe.  There are certainly      
03:01:31
17  local rules about -- I would just like to see them.            
03:01:33
18             MS. PARKER:  I'm happy to give him a copy now.      
03:01:36
19             THE COURT:  Well, give him a copy.                  
03:01:39
20             Proceed. 03:01:54
21             MS. PARKER:  Let's go over the facts that you have  
03:01:56
22  in this case about Mrs. Graham and her awareness of health     
03:01:59
23  risks. 03:02:05
24             Well, she was born into a world where the risks of  
03:02:05
25  smoking were already known.  Remember back in 1899, the State  
03:02:09 214
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
1  of Florida enacted a law.  We showed you that law during       
03:02:14
2  trial, a law that prohibits the sale of cigarettes because of  
03:02:17
3  the dangers of smoking.  03:02:22
4             Now, of course, that was later changed because the  
03:02:23
5  State of Florida decided that adults could have the choice to  
03:02:27
6  smoke. 03:02:29
7             And then we know -- and I showed you this during    
03:02:30
8  trial -- in 1906, remember, there was the official document    
03:02:34
9  from the State of Florida Health Department, and that          
03:02:39
10  official document from the State of Florida referred to        
03:02:42
11  cigarettes as an addiction.  And another one -- there it is.   
03:02:45
12  Another one that we showed you from 1912 referred to it as     
03:02:49
13  coffin nails. 03:02:54
14             And then remember Reader's Digest.  You saw the     
03:02:54
15  Reader's Digest articles at trial.  They started publishing    
03:03:00
16  articles about the health risks of smoking starting in 1924,   
03:03:04
17  and they continued to publish dozens and dozens of articles    
03:03:09
18  about the health risks of smoking.                             
03:03:13
19             And, in fact, 90 percent of all Americans in 1954,  
03:03:15
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
20  90 percent from this poll that you were shown, June 1954,      
03:03:24
21  said that they had heard or read that cigarette smoking may    
03:03:29
22  be a cause of lung cancer.                                     
03:03:34
23             And then remember the 1964 report came out.  That   
03:03:35
24  was front-page news.  Everywhere in the United States,         
03:03:40
25  including here in Jacksonville.  Remember, we showed you       
03:03:43 215
1  these newspaper articles.  And that same year, the American    
03:03:46
2  Medical Association -- 03:03:52
3             MR. BYRD:  Your Honor, this slide I object to       
03:03:53
4  under orders in the motion in limine about actual knowledge.   
03:03:55
5  There is no -- can we discuss this?  I've just never seen      
03:04:00
6  these. 03:04:04
7             THE COURT:  I don't have it either.                 
03:04:05
8             MR. BYRD:  Can you take it down?                    
03:04:08
9             THE COURT:  Yes, take it down.                      
03:04:10
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
9             MS. PARKER:  Let me go back to where we were        
03:13:21
10  before we took the break.                                      
03:13:24
11             We were talking about the 1964 Surgeon General's    
03:13:26
12  Report.  Remember when that came out, it was front-page news.  
03:13:29
13  All across the country.  Including -- remember, you saw these  
03:13:34
14  newspaper articles during trial during the actual -- will you  
03:13:37
15  pull those up.  The newspaper articles.                        
03:13:43
16             During the trial, you saw these newspaper           
03:13:45
17  articles. 03:13:48
18             Back.  There you go.
19             Remember those?  This was front-page news here in   
03:13:52
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
20  Jacksonville, as well as all around the United States.  And    
03:13:56
21  these were the newspapers, of course, that Mrs. Graham         
03:14:00
22  herself read according to her family members.                  
03:14:04
23             That same year, the American Medical Association,   
03:14:07
24  you heard this at trial, as well, said that the hazards of     
03:14:12
25  cigarette smoking were common knowledge.                       
03:14:17 223
1             And we know about the television news reports on    
03:14:19
2  it, and the public service announcements, like the ones you    
03:14:23
3  saw from Larry Hagman.  And then remember you saw this slide   
03:14:28
4  when we cross-examined Dr. Cummings.  This is from Daniel      
03:14:33
5  Horn.  Remember, Daniel Horn was the head of the federal       
03:14:38
6  government's National Clearinghouse on smoking and health.     
03:14:42
7             And he said, back in 1968, You should stand on a    
03:14:45
8  rooftop and shout smoking is dangerous at the top of your      
03:14:51
9  lungs and you would not be telling anyone anything they did    
03:14:55
10  not already know. 03:14:58
11             Now, in addition to this evidence, what have you    
03:14:59
12  heard in this trial about Mrs. Graham?  And, remember, no      
03:15:08
13  amount of money that somebody spends on ads compares to what   
03:15:12
14  you learn in your own life and with your own family members.   
03:15:16
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
15             What did she learn in her own life about the        
03:15:21
16  health risks of smoking?  Well, remember the key testimony of  
03:15:24
17  her daughter, Barbara Beaty, the one who knew her the best.    
03:15:29
18  Remember, Ms. Beaty came in here yesterday and she made it     
03:15:34
19  clear over and over that her mother knew about the health      
03:15:38
20  risks of smoking. 03:15:41
21             And Mrs. Graham called her cigarettes cancer        
03:15:42
22  sticks.  Remember the testimony was she would go over to the   
03:15:45
23  table and she would see her package of cigarettes and she      
03:15:50
24  would say, Let me light one of these cancer sticks.            
03:15:53
25             And remember Mrs. Graham called her smoker's cough  
03:15:58 224
1  a damn smoker's cough.  Remember that evidence?  That is       
03:16:03
2  another warning to her from her own body that smoking was      
03:16:06
3  causing her to have a cough, and she acknowledged that.  She   
03:16:10
4  blamed that on smoking.  03:16:15
5             And remember her mother.  Remember the testimony    
03:16:16
6  about her mother who was diagnosed with emphysema.  As soon    
03:16:19
7  as she was diagnosed with emphysema, she quit smoking, and     
03:16:23
8  she put a sign on her front door that said "no smoking."       
03:16:25
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
9             That's another warning to Mrs. Graham about the     
03:16:29
10  health risks of smoking from her own mother who told her and   
03:16:32
11  her brothers and sisters that they should not smoke.           
03:16:36
12             And then when her brother, Charles Herrin, took     
03:16:40
13  the stand -- he was the very first witness for the plaintiff.  
03:16:43
14  And Mr. Walker examined him.  When Mr. Walker cross-examined   
03:16:46
15  him, he admitted, plain as can be, she knew.  He said that as  
03:16:50
16  clear as day sitting right here on the witness stand.          
03:16:54
17             And then Mr. Graham, yesterday, admitted that when  
03:16:57
18  he quit smoking himself, he felt a whole lot better.  He said  
03:17:00
19  he felt healthier, and he said he told Mrs. Graham that.       
03:17:05
20             Again, more information to Mrs. Graham.             
03:17:08
21             Mr. Graham told her that smoking could cause lung   
03:17:14
22  cancer.  You heard that yesterday.  You heard yesterday that   
03:17:17
23  Mrs. Graham warned her children that they should not smoke     
03:17:20
24  and that smoking was a very bad habit and they shouldn't       
03:17:24
25  start. 03:17:28 225
1             You heard that Mrs. Graham read newspapers          
03:17:29
2  throughout her life, cover to cover.  She read magazines, and  
03:17:32
3  she watched the news on TV almost every night.  You heard      
03:17:35
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
4  Mr. Graham admit that, and her daughter said the same, when    
03:17:38
5  they were living together.                                     
03:17:42
6             And Mrs. Graham was exposed to these warning        
03:17:44
7  labels every time she started smoking.  Remember the three     
03:17:46
8  warning labels that you saw at trial.                          
03:17:51
9             Now, after all of that mountain of information      
03:17:54
10  there, you are going to have to decide if it's credible to     
03:17:59
11  believe that Mrs. Graham did not know about the health risks   
03:18:05
12  of smoking, which is what her husband, Mr. Graham, the one     
03:18:10
13  who's here asking for money, that's what he said yesterday up  
03:18:13
14  on the stand. 03:18:17
15             The real Mrs. Graham, the facts of the real         
03:18:17
16  Mrs. Graham, was well aware of the risks of smoking, and       
03:18:23
17  there was nothing that Reynolds or Philip Morris did that      
03:18:28
18  changed that. 03:18:31
19             Now, the plaintiff has spent a lot of time in this  
03:18:31
20  case trying to convince you that the public did not know       
03:18:36
21  about the health risks of smoking because of something the     
03:18:40
22  tobacco companies did. 03:18:44
23             Well, let's talk about that for a minute.  You      
03:18:45
24  know, you don't need to know the minute details and all the    
03:18:50
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
25  scientific information that are in some of the documents you   
03:18:56 226
1  were seeing to know what's really important, and that is that  
03:19:00
2  smoking causes health problems, smoking can cause you to have  
03:19:03
3  cancer, smoking can result in your death.                      
03:19:08
4             And one of the things that you can do in this case  
03:19:10
5  when you are back in the jury room is to use your common       
03:19:12
6  sense.  So let me give you an example -- again, just use your  
03:19:16
7  common sense when you think about that.                        
03:19:20
8             We all know that if you drink alcoholic beverages,  
03:19:21
9  if you drink beer and go out and drink liquor, you don't know  
03:19:26
10  those scientific minute technical parts of drinking, what's    
03:19:31
11  in alcohol.  You don't know exactly what the chemicals are in  
03:19:34
12  beer or in liquor.  You don't know exactly how beer or liquor  
03:19:38
13  affects your brain.  You know, you don't know all that         
03:19:44
14  information.  03:19:46
15             But if you use your common sense, every one of us   
03:19:49
16  knows what's important, and that is if you drink too much,     
03:19:51
17  you can get drunk, and if you drink too much and you drive,    
03:19:54
18  you can cause a wreck and you can kill somebody.               
03:19:57
19             That's what's important.                            
03:20:00
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
20             And it's the same thing with cigarettes.            
03:20:02
21  Mrs. Graham knew what all the rest of the American public      
03:20:05
22  knew, and that's what's important, and that is that smoking    
03:20:09
23  had health risks. 03:20:11
24             You did not need to know the specific technical     
03:20:13
25  aspects of how that worked to know the risks that were         
03:20:16 227
1  associated with using that product.                            
03:20:21
2             At the end of the day, the simple truth is that     
03:20:24
3  Mrs. Graham was fully aware of the health risks of smoking     
03:20:28
4  and their efforts to repackage her as somebody who did not     
03:20:32
5  know because of the tobacco companies is just not correct.     
03:20:36
6             Now, let's go to the second simple truth in this    
03:20:40
7  case, and that is that Mrs. Graham was able to quit smoking.   
03:20:44
8             Now, Mr. Graham is required to prove that           
03:20:48
9  Mrs. Graham was addicted to cigarettes, and -- and that the    
03:20:54
10  legal cause of her cancer was an addiction to cigarettes.      
03:20:59
11  Those are two different things.  Those are Questions 1 and 2   
03:21:04
12  on the verdict form. 03:21:11
13             Your answer to both of those should be no.          
03:21:13
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
14             What was the evidence?  What evidence did you       
03:21:16
15  hear?  Well, was the evidence that nicotine addiction          
03:21:18
16  controlled Mrs. Graham and left her no choice, no matter how   
03:21:22
17  much she tried, but just to keep on smoking until she passed   
03:21:27
18  away?  Was that the evidence?  Or was the evidence that Faye   
03:21:31
19  Graham liked to smoke?  She enjoyed smoking.  She didn't       
03:21:35
20  seriously try to quit, and she had the ability to quit at any  
03:21:39
21  time. 03:21:42
22             Now, this case is not about the general issue       
03:21:43
23  about whether or not cigarettes can be addictive, because      
03:21:46
24  they can be.  And this case is not about other people or       
03:21:49
25  someone else you may know who is addicted.  That's not what    
03:21:52 228
1  we are here about.  We are only here about Mrs. Graham.        
03:21:55
2             Mrs. Graham did not fit the profile of somebody     
03:21:58
3  who was an addict.  What were the facts of Mrs. Graham?        
03:22:03
4  Well, she was not someone who hated smoking.                   
03:22:07
5             Remember the testimony from both her daughter and   
03:22:11
6  her husband was that she liked to smoke.  She enjoyed          
03:22:14
7  smoking.  Remember her routine was that she had a cigarette    
03:22:17
8  with a cup of coffee.  Her daughter said that cigarettes and   
03:22:20
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
9  coffee went together for her mother.                           
03:22:26
10             She is not someone who sincerely tried everything   
03:22:29
11  she could to quit but she just couldn't.  That's not her.      
03:22:33
12  She was not someone who was unable to quit because she was an  
03:22:39
13  addict, a person who lost free will about smoking.             
03:22:42
14             She is not somebody who was tormented by her        
03:22:46
15  smoking.  As a matter of fact, the evidence was she was never  
03:22:49
16  angry at a tobacco company even after she got sick.            
03:22:53
17             The profile that they are describing does not fit   
03:22:57
18  the facts of this case.  03:23:00
19             And the true picture, the true facts of             
03:23:02
20  Mrs. Graham are just the opposite.  She is a lady who enjoyed  
03:23:05
21  smoking, who knew the risks, and who wanted to smoke.          
03:23:10
22             Now, you heard at trial there are a lot of          
03:23:13
23  different labels for smoking.  Sometimes people call it a      
03:23:16
24  habit.  Sometimes people call it an addiction.  There have     
03:23:20
25  been different definitions of addiction.                       
03:23:23 229
1             Remember our federal government said that there     
03:23:24
2  was a classic definition of addiction, and that definition     
03:23:27
3  required intoxication.  And smoking is not intoxicating.       
03:23:32
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
4             And then that definition has changed by the         
03:23:35
5  federal government at a later time.                            
03:23:39
6             So there have been different labels.  Whatever you  
03:23:41
7  call it, though, the question is and what's important is, can  
03:23:45
8  the smoker quit?  Can smokers quit?  And the answer is yes.    
03:23:47
9  All smokers can quit.  Even addicted smokers.                  
03:23:53
10             Of course, it may be more difficult for some        
03:23:56
11  smokers than for others, but with sufficient motivation and    
03:23:59
12  effort, all smokers can quit.  And that's why there are over   
03:24:03
13  60 million, 60 million former smokers, alive today in the      
03:24:07
14  United States. 03:24:13
15             3,000 people quit smoking every day.                
03:24:13
16             Now, to get around the facts of Mrs. Graham, they   
03:24:17
17  keep talking about this brain disease.  Okay.  That is their   
03:24:22
18  theory of their case, is that Mrs. Graham had a brain disease  
03:24:27
19  and, therefore, she wasn't able to quit.  Let's talk about     
03:24:31
20  that. 03:24:35
21             That story just does not fit the facts of           
03:24:37
22  Mrs. Graham.  Here's what the evidence shows about             
03:24:40
23  Mrs. Graham.  Nicotine does not permanently change your        
03:24:44
24  brain.  Nicotine leaves your body after two to three days.     
03:24:48
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
25  Nicotine does not prevent smokers from understanding the       
03:24:52 230
1  risks of smoking.  Nicotine does not prevent smokers from      
03:24:56
2  quitting. 03:25:00
3             So let's talk for a few minutes about the           
03:25:00
4  witnesses.  What was the evidence about the witnesses that     
03:25:06
5  the plaintiff brought you on the issue of addiction?  Well,    
03:25:10
6  there was Dr. Cummings.  Remember, Dr. Cummings has this       
03:25:13
7  traveling show.  He goes around from courtroom to courtroom    
03:25:17
8  testifying.  This is his 11th trial just this year.            
03:25:21
9             Remember this chart that I showed to Dr. Cummings   
03:25:27
10  when he was here?  This is just the amount of time he spent    
03:25:29
11  the last six weeks testifying.  60 percent of his income       
03:25:33
12  comes from testifying.  He's made over a million dollars.      
03:25:39
13             And I asked him when I cross-examined him, and he   
03:25:44
14  agreed, he is not an independent witness.  He admits he's      
03:25:47
15  biased.  He said he was rooting for Mr. Graham to win.  And    
03:25:50
16  he gave no opinions that are specific to Mrs. Graham.  He      
03:25:55
17  talked for, what, over two days just in general.               
03:25:59
18             He has this one-size-fits-all presentation, and he  
03:26:05
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
19  goes from courtroom to courtroom to courtroom and puts it on.  
03:26:08
20             And outside of the courtroom when he is not being   
03:26:11
21  paid, he has a smoking clinic where he tells people to come    
03:26:16
22  to his clinic, You can quit.  He never tells anybody, Hey,     
03:26:20
23  leave, I don't want you to come.  You can't quit.              
03:26:24
24             Remember, I showed you this brochure when he        
03:26:27
25  cross-examined him.  This is his own brochure that he wrote    
03:26:30 231
1  and it says, If you answer those questions, you can stop       
03:26:33
2  smoking.  So even their witness, Dr. Cummings, admits smokers  
03:26:38
3  can quit. 03:26:44
4             Who was their other witness on addiction?           
03:26:45
5  Dr. Feingold.  Another professional witness.  Almost all he    
03:26:47
6  does is come to court, also.  Remember, he said he made        
03:26:53
7  almost $40 million testifying.  Much of it with                
03:26:56
8  Mr. Lantinberg's law partner, Mr. Wilner.  He and Mr. Wilner   
03:27:02
9  have been working together for over 30 years.                  
03:27:07
10             And Dr. Feingold did not even know anything about   
03:27:10
11  Mrs. Graham's children.  The only deposition he had read in    
03:27:16
12  the entire case was the deposition of the plaintiff, of        
03:27:20
13  Mr. Graham, the person who is here asking for money.           
03:27:23
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
14             Again, the facts are our witnesses.  No medical     
03:27:26
15  record says that Mrs. Graham was addicted.  No treating        
03:27:33
16  doctor of Mrs. Graham said that Mrs. Graham was addicted.      
03:27:39
17             But Dr. Feingold is coming to court, disagreeing    
03:27:44
18  with the medical records.                                      
03:27:48
19             He was hired and he was paid to come into court     
03:27:49
20  for one reason, and that's to take the stand and to say what   
03:27:54
21  he needed to say so they could answer the legal requirements   
03:27:57
22  that they have to make to meet their burden of proof.          
03:28:01
23             But even Dr. Feingold, even he admitted two         
03:28:04
24  things:  Mrs. Graham was not a robot.  And, of course,         
03:28:10
25  Mrs. Graham could have quit smoking at any time.               
03:28:15 232
1             It is still the responsibility of the smoker,       
03:28:20
2  Mrs. Graham, to make that effort to quit.                      
03:28:24
3             So what is the evidence about Mrs. Graham's effort  
03:28:28
4  to quit?  Well, you have to want to quit for yourself.         
03:28:32
5  Mrs. Graham had to want to quit for herself.  It doesn't work  
03:28:37
6  if somebody else wants you to quit but you don't.  You have    
03:28:39
7  to be motivated for yourself.                                  
03:28:42
8             Mrs. Graham is the person who was in charge of her  
03:28:44
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
9  decisions about smoking. 03:28:49
10             She never made a serious effort to quit because     
03:28:50
11  she didn't want to.  She wanted to smoke.  She liked to        
03:28:55
12  smoke.  That's how she decided she wanted to live her life.    
03:28:58
13             Remember, you heard every single witness agree,     
03:29:02
14  she never made an effort to quit that lasted more than 24      
03:29:05
15  hours. 03:29:09
16             Her daughter, Barbara, who testified yesterday,     
03:29:10
17  who knew her better than anyone else, said she only tried to   
03:29:13
18  quit one time in her entire life.  And that happened when she  
03:29:16
19  went to hypnosis, and that was after 1985.                     
03:29:22
20             Just think about that.  From when she first         
03:29:26
21  started smoking all the way until sometime after 1985, her     
03:29:29
22  daughter, who lived with her, most of the time, she only       
03:29:33
23  tried to quit one time, and that's when she went to hypnosis.  
03:29:39
24             What happened?  When she went to hypnosis,          
03:29:42
25  Mr. Graham went with her.  Mr. Graham says when she got back   
03:29:45 233
1  in the car -- as soon as she got back in the car, she started  
03:29:49
2  smoking again.  Now, that's not a serious effort to quit.      
03:29:52
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
3             She never threw out her cigarettes.  That is        
03:29:56
4  absolutely undisputed here.                                    
03:29:59
5             She enjoyed smoking.  And smoking does not take     
03:30:00
6  away personal responsibility.  The smoker has control of her   
03:30:03
7  own behavior. 03:30:10
8             Addiction does not mean that you cannot quit.       
03:30:12
9  Addiction does not relieve a smoker of responsibility for her  
03:30:16
10  own behavior. 03:30:20
11             And you know there is nothing wrong with the        
03:30:20
12  decisions that Mrs. Graham made.  It's legal to smoke.         
03:30:25
13  That's how she wanted to lead her life.  And we are not        
03:30:28
14  second -- we ask that you not second-guess the decisions that  
03:30:31
15  she made for her own life.                                     
03:30:36
16             Now, Question 2 on the verdict form asks            
03:30:38
17  specifically about legal cause.  Well, the answer to that      
03:30:42
18  question on the verdict form should be no, because addiction   
03:30:46
19  did not prevent her from quitting.  She never made a serious   
03:30:49
20  effort to quit. 03:30:53
21             That's going to be undisputed when you go back to   
03:30:54
22  the jury room.  No witness told you otherwise.                 
03:30:57
23             Mrs. Graham knew smoking had health risks, and she  
03:30:59
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
24  never made a serious effort to quit.                           
03:31:03
25             Which brings us to Truth No. 3, which is that       
03:31:06 234
1  Mr. Graham did not prove his medical case.                     
03:31:10
2             The plaintiff has to prove to your satisfaction     
03:31:13
3  that Mrs. Graham had lung cancer, and that it was caused by    
03:31:18
4  smoking.  And that's Question 3 on the verdict form.           
03:31:23
5             Again, it was 1993 when Mrs. Graham passed away.    
03:31:28
6  And you are going to have to decide if they have met their     
03:31:33
7  burden of proof to prove to you that her cancer actually       
03:31:36
8  started in her lung.  Those very first cancer cells started    
03:31:39
9  in her lung, and that her cancer was caused by smoking.  They  
03:31:43
10  had the burden of proof on that.                               
03:31:47
11             Well, ladies and gentlemen, let me just             
03:31:49
12  respectfully suggest to you that that question, answering      
03:31:51
13  that question is going to come down to who do you believe,     
03:31:55
14  her doctors or Dr. Feingold?                                   
03:31:58
15             Now, Dr. Feingold was their witness that they       
03:32:01
16  brought in.  Remember all that evidence on his background?     
03:32:06
17  He is the 40-million-dollar machine.  He did not treat         
03:32:09
18  Mrs. Graham.  He never talked to her doctors.  He is not a     
03:32:13
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
19  pathologist.  03:32:19
20             Compare that to the treaters.  Remember, this is    
03:32:21
21  back in 1992 and 1993 when those medical records were          
03:32:24
22  created.  There was no lawsuit back then.  Nobody was trying   
03:32:28
23  to get money back then.  That's Mrs. Graham going to her       
03:32:31
24  doctor trying to get well, trying to get better, and all her   
03:32:34
25  doctors were doing was trying to treat her as a patient.  She  
03:32:38 235
1  was their patient. 03:32:42
2             And here's what these -- the facts, our witnesses,  
03:32:42
3  the facts, here's what these medical records say.  Well,       
03:32:47
4  there is no medical record that said her cancer was caused by  
03:32:51
5  smoking.  Not a one.  Those are in evidence.  And you can      
03:32:56
6  look through all of them.  There is not a place in there that  
03:32:59
7  says it. 03:33:02
8             Her treating doctors, not a one of them said her    
03:33:03
9  cancer was caused by smoking.                                  
03:33:06
10             And the death certificate, Mr. Byrd showed you the  
03:33:09
11  death certificate when he was talking with you.  Her death     
03:33:12
12  certificate does not say anywhere on there that her cancer     
03:33:15
13  was caused by smoking.  And that's something they have to      
03:33:19
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
14  prove. 03:33:23
15             Remember about the clear chest x-ray?  Remember     
03:33:24
16  this medical record that Mr. Walker cross-examined             
03:33:29
17  Dr. Feingold on?  It says down there, chest x-ray negative.    
03:33:32
18             Dr. Feingold says he disagrees with the treaters.   
03:33:37
19  Remember, he said, Well, this was an error.  He said, It was   
03:33:40
20  late at night -- and this was a neurosurgeon, for gosh sakes.  
03:33:44
21  He says, This is an error.  Her lung was never biopsied.       
03:33:48
22  There was never any tissue taken from her lung.  They only     
03:33:53
23  biopsied her brain.  She had surgery on her brain, not on her  
03:33:56
24  lung. 03:34:00
25             And her doctor said -- remember this medical        
03:34:01 236
1  record that possible primary sites, that means where it could  
03:34:05
2  have started, include the female reproductive tract, the       
03:34:08
3  GI tract, breast, and lung.                                    
03:34:12
4             And then remember about the signet ring cells.      
03:34:14
5  That's really important.  Her doctor, her own pathologist,     
03:34:19
6  again, not involved in any litigation back in 1992, he looked  
03:34:24
7  at her actual tissue and he said in his report that there was  
03:34:28
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
8  areas of signet ring differentiation.                          
03:34:34
9             Dr. Feingold says that's another mistake by her     
03:34:38
10  treaters.  He says he disagrees with that.                     
03:34:41
11             And this is really important, Dr. Feingold          
03:34:44
12  admitted that he may not have seen all the slides that her     
03:34:48
13  doctors saw.  03:34:51
14             There was -- again, there was never a biopsy from   
03:34:52
15  her lung.  Well, why is this important?  Why is this so        
03:34:56
16  important --  03:35:00
17             MR. BYRD:  Objection, your Honor.  The order.       
03:35:00
18             THE COURT:  Overruled.                              
03:35:02
19             MS. PARKER:  Why is this so important about the     
03:35:03
20  signet ring cells?  It's because Dr. Feingold himself          
03:35:07
21  admitted if you have signet ring cells present, it's more      
03:35:10
22  likely that your cancer started in your GI tract.  And they    
03:35:15
23  never did any test of her GI tract.                            
03:35:19
24             And even when signet ring cells arrive in the       
03:35:24
25  lung, Dr. Feingold admitted it has not been shown that those   
03:35:28 237
1  cancers are caused by smoking.  That's why it's so important   
03:35:32
2  for him to come in here and say there were no cigarette ring   
03:35:36
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
3  cells, because if there were, they cannot meet their burden    
03:35:40
4  of proof. 03:35:43
5             So, again, who are you going to believe?            
03:35:43
6             Dr. Feingold, who looked at this tissue, says       
03:35:45
7  he -- can't even say he looked at all of it, 20 years later,   
03:35:49
8  or her treaters who are independent.                           
03:35:53
9             Again, the facts are our witnesses.                 
03:35:56
10             But it's not enough for them just to prove this     
03:36:02
11  issue about the medicine.  There are a lot of other things     
03:36:05
12  they have to prove in the case, and so I need to go over       
03:36:07
13  those issues with you, as well.                                
03:36:09
14             And that brings us to Truth No. 4, which is         
03:36:11
15  Mr. Graham cannot establish something called legal cause.      
03:36:14
16  That's on the verdict form.                                    
03:36:17
17             Their claims require an established link or a tie   
03:36:20
18  between Mrs. Graham and something that Reynolds or Philip      
03:36:25
19  Morris did. 03:36:29
20             It can't be guesswork.  It can't be speculation.    
03:36:30
21  It has to be proof, not doubt.  They have to prove it.  And    
03:36:34
22  without that, there is no legal cause, and that's required on  
03:36:38
23  the verdict form. 03:36:42
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
24             Well, they spent during the trial most of their     
03:36:43
25  time talking about tobacco companies just in general.  But     
03:36:47 238
1  don't let that throw you off the fact of Mrs. Graham.          
03:36:51
2             Dr. Cummings said there were 16 million documents   
03:36:57
3  out there that he had looked at.  Remember that?               
03:37:00
4             Well, they have cherry-picked a few phrases and a   
03:37:02
5  few sentences from some of the documents to come in here and   
03:37:07
6  to make us look bad.  That is all that they are trying to do.  
03:37:10
7  They are trying to get you mad and upset so you will not       
03:37:13
8  think about Mrs. Graham. 03:37:17
9             But in the end, you are going to see none of those  
03:37:18
10  things that they talked about has anything to do with her,     
03:37:23
11  and you are only here to decide issues about her.              
03:37:25
12             For example, they don't -- they have only given     
03:37:29
13  you half of the story, and they don't want you to hear the     
03:37:33
14  rest of it. 03:37:36
15             Even that chart that Mr. Byrd showed you, that big  
03:37:37
16  chart he had here, the timeline, remember all of those pink    
03:37:41
17  notes that I put on there about the rest of it, other things   
03:37:44
18  that happened, he took those off.  He doesn't want you to      
03:37:47
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
19  know that.  He doesn't want you to think about that.           
03:37:50
20             MR. BYRD:  Objection.  I did not take those off.    
03:37:53
21             THE COURT:  I'll sustain that.                      
03:37:55
22             MR. BYRD:  Move to strike that.                     
03:37:58
23             THE COURT:  No.  Just move on.                      
03:37:59
24             MS. PARKER:  For example, you were shown this       
03:38:01
25  document by Dr. Cummings from 1959.  Remember, they showed     
03:38:03 239
1  you this document with Dr. Cummings.  And he said, Oh, this    
03:38:07
2  is proof that we knew something that the public didn't from    
03:38:13
3  November 1959.  And this is about some chemicals that were     
03:38:16
4  known to produce cancer. 03:38:22
5             And when I cross-examined him, I'm the one who had  
03:38:24
6  to bring out that very same year, the very same month in       
03:38:28
7  Reader's Digest is the same information.                       
03:38:32
8             And then remember about the congressional           
03:38:36
9  hearings.  They showed you a tiny, little snippet for about    
03:38:40
10  ten seconds where they went down the line and they asked the   
03:38:44
11  CEOs about addiction.  And remember the CEO of Reynolds was    
03:38:47
12  cut off.  He was trying to answer and he was cut off.  And     
03:38:51
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
13  the congressman who was conducting the hearings said, I'll     
03:38:55
14  take that as a no. 03:38:58
15             And then I had to come back and play the rest of    
03:38:59
16  it, where he explained that when he said cigarettes were not   
03:39:02
17  addicting, that's true under the classic definition, which     
03:39:06
18  requires intoxication. 03:39:12
19             And I asked Dr. Cummings and he admitted that what  
03:39:14
20  Mr. Johnston said on that video that you were shown was true.  
03:39:19
21  Cigarettes are not addictive under that classic definition.    
03:39:24
22  Again, they showed you a tiny, little snippet, not the whole   
03:39:28
23  story, to try to make you mad at us.                           
03:39:32
24             Mr. Lantinberg said in his opening last Monday, he  
03:39:36
25  said, you know, we need to take you back in time.  Remember,   
03:39:41 240
1  he said you need to go back in time, back in time.  Well,      
03:39:44
2  that's true for the defendants as well.                        
03:39:47
3             Reynolds and Philip Morris need to be judged by     
03:39:49
4  what they knew and what was going on back then, not years and  
03:39:53
5  years later when, you know, Monday morning quarterbacking and  
03:39:59
6  when you have hindsight, things might have been done           
03:40:03
7  differently.  03:40:06
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
8             I want to talk about what the evidence was about    
03:40:07
9  this charge that they keep making that we manipulated          
03:40:10
10  cigarettes.  Well, that is not correct.  Dr. Cummings          
03:40:14
11  admitted when I cross-examined him that cigarettes today are   
03:40:18
12  no more addictive than cigarettes in the 1950s.                
03:40:23
13             Think about that.  Everything from the 1950s        
03:40:28
14  forward that they claim we did, which I'm going to address in  
03:40:32
15  a minute, he says notwithstanding all of that, cigarettes      
03:40:36
16  today are no more addictive.  Again, it's just some phrases    
03:40:39
17  that they want to use, like rigging cigarettes and all, to     
03:40:45
18  get you mad at us.  For example, about these light             
03:40:49
19  cigarettes, and Mr. Byrd talked about those.                   
03:40:52
20             All of these people, all of these organizations,    
03:40:55
21  told us that we should research this issue of lowering --      
03:40:59
22  lowering the tar-to-nicotine ratio as a way to try to develop  
03:41:05
23  a safer cigarette.  That's why we were doing this research.    
03:41:09
24  Because the Surgeon General -- three reports said we should    
03:41:16
25  do the research, and advocated this.                           
03:41:17 241
1             The National Cancer Institute -- remember that      
03:41:19
2  Tobacco Working Group, we were a member of it.  The            
03:41:22
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
3  Department of Agriculture folks were a member.  They           
03:41:24
4  investigated this as well -- as well as all these other        
03:41:27
5  people listed up here. 03:41:30
6             Remember the jar I showed you of the reconstituted  
03:41:37
7  tobacco.  And I asked Dr. Cummings, and he finally agreed,     
03:41:40
8  that process that he talked about is a way of manipulating     
03:41:42
9  nicotine.  In that process, the nicotine is taken off, less    
03:41:47
10  nicotine is put back on.  That process actually results in     
03:41:51
11  tobacco that has less nicotine than when it started, and he    
03:41:55
12  agreed with that. 03:41:59
13             Ladies and gentlemen, there is a point about these  
03:42:06
14  light cigarettes and the low-tar issue that I want to spend a  
03:42:09
15  few minutes and talk to you about.  You heard it this          
03:42:14
16  morning, and I want to take some time and explain what it      
03:42:16
17  means. 03:42:19
18             This morning you saw a video of Dr. Jupe.           
03:42:19
19  Remember, he was the Philip Morris witness -- it was the       
03:42:24
20  first one they played this morning.  Dr. Jupe said on the      
03:42:27
21  video that in the E.U., that's the European Union, of course,  
03:42:31
22  in Europe, that these light cigarettes are the only ones that  
03:42:37
23  are allowed to be sold.  Think about that.                     
03:42:41
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
24             If you travel to France or to Europe or any other   
03:42:45
25  country in Europe today, these cigarettes that they claim      
03:42:48 242
1  that we did all these bad things about, that's the only kind   
03:42:51
2  of cigarettes you can buy, because in Europe, they are         
03:42:55
3  officially considered safer.                                   
03:42:59
4             There is a good faith basis for Reynolds and        
03:43:03
5  Philip Morris to have done this research and to make the       
03:43:06
6  claims that they made, which are the same claims that were     
03:43:09
7  being made by the Surgeon General, the National Cancer         
03:43:12
8  Institute, and all these other people.                         
03:43:15
9             And Dr. Cummings never tied any of the claims he    
03:43:17
10  made, any of those allegations he made up on the stand, to     
03:43:21
11  Mrs. Graham.  03:43:26
12             Now, they showed you some cigarette advertising.    
03:43:26
13  Advertising had nothing to do with Mrs. Graham's life.  There  
03:43:30
14  is no evidence at all that she started to smoke because she    
03:43:35
15  saw an ad and ran out to buy a pack of cigarettes.  There is   
03:43:38
16  no evidence that she made any decision about smoking because   
03:43:42
17  of ads.  03:43:45
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
18             I asked her daughter that.  Her daughter said no.   
03:43:46
19  I asked Mr. Graham that, and Mr. Graham said no.  Again, no    
03:43:49
20  legal cause.  03:43:53
21             Anything that she really did see is fair game, but  
03:43:54
22  all of this other stuff that they keep talking about is not    
03:44:00
23  fair game.  There is no legal cause.  There is no tie.  There  
03:44:03
24  is no link to Mrs. Graham.                                     
03:44:06
25             Here's what Mr. Graham and the daughter, Barbara,   
03:44:07 243
1  both agreed to.  They both agreed on the witness stand that    
03:44:12
2  Mrs. Graham never saw and never heard any kind of statement    
03:44:17
3  from a tobacco company, never said anything a tobacco company  
03:44:20
4  did caused her to start smoking or continue smoking.  She      
03:44:24
5  never had any communications with Reynolds or any other        
03:44:28
6  tobacco company.  Again, no legal cause.                       
03:44:31
7             Which brings us to Truth No. 5, which is the last   
03:44:34
8  one, and that is that cigarettes are legal.  Cigarettes are    
03:44:38
9  both dangerous and legal.                                      
03:44:42
10             Now, there is nothing that you have heard in this   
03:44:46
11  case, none of those documents, none of that testimony, there   
03:44:50
12  is nothing that you have heard in this case that isn't         
03:44:54
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
13  already known by the federal government, by the Surgeon        
03:44:56
14  General, by the State of Florida, by the National Cancer       
03:44:59
15  Institute. 03:45:04
16             Those documents are and they have been public.      
03:45:04
17  They are available on a website.  This is not some special     
03:45:07
18  secret something that only you have seen.  That was not        
03:45:12
19  correct. 03:45:15
20             Our government, the State of Florida, and the       
03:45:16
21  federal government knowing about the health risks of           
03:45:19
22  smoking -- you know this number he keeps talking about,        
03:45:25
23  400,000 people die every year from smoking, that is an         
03:45:27
24  official federal government number.  Our federal government    
03:45:31
25  knows that. 03:45:34 244
1             But our government, our society, has said,          
03:45:35
2  notwithstanding that, people know about the health risks of    
03:45:39
3  smoking and cigarettes should be a legal product.              
03:45:43
4             MR. BYRD:  Objection, your Honor.  The order.       
03:45:47
5             THE COURT:  Overruled.                              
03:45:50
6             MS. PARKER:  In fact, in terms of what was known    
03:45:51
7  in 19 -- the Surgeon General said it was known back in 1920    
03:45:55
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
8  that nicotine was in tobacco in cigarettes.  It's no secret.   
03:46:01
9             And this is really important.  Reynolds cannot be   
03:46:08
10  held liable merely for selling cigarettes or advertising       
03:46:11
11  cigarettes.  There has to be more.                             
03:46:17
12             And the Court is going to give you those            
03:46:19
13  instructions at the end of the case.                           
03:46:20
14             MR. BYRD:  Same objection.                          
03:46:22
15             THE COURT:  Overruled.                              
03:46:23
16             MS. PARKER:  I want to take a few minutes and talk  
03:46:25
17  to you about the Engle findings from the other jury that       
03:46:27
18  Mr. Byrd talked about.  Those findings do not decide the       
03:46:30
19  questions that you have here.                                  
03:46:34
20             Just remember that other jury didn't hear anything  
03:46:35
21  about Mrs. Graham.  They didn't hear about her life.  They     
03:46:37
22  didn't hear her name.  They didn't know what kind of           
03:46:41
23  cigarettes she smoked.  They didn't know about the illness.    
03:46:43
24  They did not know anything about her at all.  And that other   
03:46:46
25  jury did not decide the questions about Mrs. Graham.  And      
03:46:49 245
1  those are the questions that are here on the verdict form for  
03:46:53
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
2  you.  03:46:55
3             That brings us back to the law and the verdict      
03:46:56
4  form.  Two important instructions you are going to get from    
03:47:01
5  the Court, one is that the plaintiff has the burden of proof.  
03:47:05
6             There are two parts to that.  Burden and proof.     
03:47:09
7  They have the burden.  I don't have to bring a witness.  I     
03:47:12
8  don't have to do anything.  They have the burden on every one  
03:47:16
9  of their claims, and they have to prove -- that's the other    
03:47:18
10  part.  They have to prove to you every single part of every    
03:47:21
11  one of the claims they are making in this case.                
03:47:24
12             You're also going to see that there is an           
03:47:26
13  instruction that the Court will read to you about sympathy,    
03:47:30
14  that you should not decide this case based on sympathy or      
03:47:36
15  prejudice against any party.  It should be decided based on    
03:47:42
16  the facts. 03:47:46
17             So if you could pull up those five.                 
03:47:46
18             Those five simple truths will answer every one of   
03:47:49
19  the questions on the verdict form.                             
03:47:54
20             When you review the evidence in the case, you will  
03:47:58
21  see that the answer to the first three questions about         
03:48:01
22  addiction and what caused her lung cancer, was it addiction    
03:48:03
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
23  or was it her choice to smoke?  And the medical part of the    
03:48:08
24  case.  Those should all be answered no.                        
03:48:11
25             Now, I want to talk about comparative fault very    
03:48:17 246
1  briefly.  When you get to that -- we say you shouldn't even    
03:48:21
2  get to that part of the verdict form, but if you do, a         
03:48:26
3  hundred percent of the fault should be the person who made     
03:48:30
4  the decisions.  Who made the decisions in her life about       
03:48:33
5  smoking?  Who made all the decisions about whether to smoke,   
03:48:38
6  whether to smoke when there are warnings?  A hundred percent   
03:48:42
7  of that should be on Mrs. Graham.                              
03:48:45
8             Now, I'm not blaming Mrs. Graham by saying that.    
03:48:47
9  We didn't file this lawsuit.  But the person who made those    
03:48:50
10  decisions about smoking is the person who has responsibility   
03:48:54
11  for those. 03:48:58
12             Finally, in addition to damages they are asking     
03:48:59
13  for -- damages here, they are asking for $6 million.  That's   
03:49:07
14  pulled out of thin air.  Totally pulled out of thin air.  And  
03:49:10
15  under the law you should consider their relationship in that   
03:49:13
16  part of the case.  This is a case where no damages should be   
03:49:17
17  awarded. 03:49:21
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
18             But on top of that, on top of the $6 million, they  
03:49:22
19  are asking for punitive damages.  They want to come back here  
03:49:25
20  for another part of the trial.  They want to put on more       
03:49:27
21  evidence, and they want to try to ask for more money than      
03:49:30
22  that. 03:49:32
23             There is no tie to any of these documents to        
03:49:33
24  Mrs. Graham.  Your answer to that should be no as well.        
03:49:37
25             Now, I'm going to conclude now and sit down.  And   
03:49:40 247
1  Mr. Geary has a few comments he's going to make to you as      
03:49:44
2  well. 03:49:47
3             But just in closing, I want to thank you for        
03:49:48
4  listening to me this afternoon.  And I want to just remind     
03:49:50
5  you that Mr. Graham said nobody forced her to smoke.  You      
03:49:54
6  know, the cigarette did not light itself and just jump into    
03:49:58
7  her mouth.  She's the one who made those decisions.            
03:50:01
8             So, again, thank you so much for your attention     
03:50:05
9  this afternoon. 03:50:08
10             Thank you, your Honor.                              


12             MR. GEARY:  Good afternoon.                         
03:50:13
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
13             You're just about finished.  You've worked hard.    
03:50:18
14  You've listened to the evidence, and we all thank you for      
03:50:22
15  that. 03:50:24
16             You've heard the words of Ms. Parker.  I agree      
03:50:26
17  with everything that she said.  I'm just going to talk to you  
03:50:27
18  about some of the evidence and some of the claims.             
03:50:31
19             I want to talk to you about Question 2, first.      
03:50:33
20             We will get that one up there.                      
03:50:36
21             Question 2 involves the question:  Did the          
03:50:38
22  plaintiff prove that Mrs. Graham's addiction legally caused    
03:50:41
23  her death? 03:50:45
24             That's really two questions.  Did addiction cause   
03:50:46
25  her death?  And did smoking cause her death?                   
03:50:48 248
1             I think the answer to that is no for different      
03:50:51
2  reasons.  And you don't have to agree on what the reason is.   
03:50:53
3             Some might say it wasn't proved by reliable         
03:50:57
4  evidence her cancer was caused by smoking.  That would be      
03:50:59
5  like saying Dr. Feingold was not reliable.  Or you could say   
03:51:03
6  it's more likely her cancer was signet ring cancer.  That's    
03:51:07
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
7  what the pathologist said.  Or you could say addiction wasn't  
03:51:12
8  a direct cause of her death.  Not for someone who's as         
03:51:16
9  capable and determined as Mrs. Graham.                         
03:51:20
10             So there are different ways you can decide that,    
03:51:22
11  and the answer is no for any combination of those.             
03:51:25
12             Let's talk a little bit more about Question 2.      
03:51:28
13             We will go to the next one, Matt.                   
03:51:30
14             The question here is:  Did the plaintiff prove      
03:51:34
15  addiction directly caused her death?  Remember what Dr. Koop   
03:51:36
16  said.  He said cigarette smoke is addictive.  But the          
03:51:40
17  individual must decide whether to quit or not.  What he is     
03:51:44
18  saying there is addiction doesn't cause disease because each   
03:51:47
19  person has a choice. 03:51:51
20             Mrs. Graham was intelligent, determined, capable.   
03:51:53
21  She could have quit.  Dr. Feingold said that.  And it's        
03:51:58
22  because of that that addiction doesn't directly cause death.   
03:52:01
23  Not in this case.  And direct -- direct is a part of legal     
03:52:04
24  cause.  To be a legal cause, it must be direct.  So the        
03:52:09
25  answer to that question is no.                                 
03:52:12 249
1             Question No. 3 relates to brands.  And the          
03:52:14
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
2  question there is whether smoking cigarettes made by that      
03:52:19
3  defendant was a legal cause of death.                          
03:52:24
4             Well, here there is no evidence specific to the     
03:52:27
5  companies.  The plaintiff must prove that Philip Morris        
03:52:31
6  brands caused her death.  That's something you can't guess     
03:52:33
7  about. 03:52:36
8             What Dr. Feingold said was that 15 years of         
03:52:37
9  pack-year smoking could cause death.  He talked about smoking  
03:52:40
10  generally over a 20-year period of time, but he didn't talk    
03:52:44
11  about Philip Morris brands.  There is only three in this       
03:52:46
12  case:  Benson & Hedges, Virginia Slims, and Marlboro.          
03:52:49
13             Benson & Hedges, maybe a few years, maybe less,     
03:52:56
14  said Barbara. 03:52:58
15             Virginia Slims, a few cigarettes, said Barbara.     
03:52:59
16  Mr. Graham didn't quantify it.                                 
03:53:03
17             The same with Marlboro.  Mr. Graham didn't say how  
03:53:04
18  much, and Barbara said that she didn't even smoke Marlboro.    
03:53:07
19             So Barbara said, No Virginia Slims, no Marlboro.    
03:53:10
20             On that basis, the answer to Question No. 3 is no,  
03:53:15
21  because there is no evidence about that, and you can't guess   
03:53:19
22  about it. 03:53:21
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
23             Question No. 4, this is the concealment claim.      
03:53:23
24  And you heard at the beginning of this case, this case is      
03:53:27
25  about concealment.  There has got to be reliance.  Did         
03:53:30 250
1  Mrs. Graham rely on the companies for information about        
03:53:34
2  smoking?  Was she waiting on Philip Morris to say something?   
03:53:37
3  No.   03:53:41
4             You heard it from the witnesses.  She didn't rely   
03:53:41
5  on anything they said.  She didn't hear statements.  She       
03:53:43
6  wasn't waiting on them.  There was no reliance.  Nothing       
03:53:46
7  Philip Morris or Reynolds said impacted her.                   
03:53:49
8             The answer to this question is no, and that         
03:53:51
9  applies to Reynolds as well.                                   
03:53:53
10             Question No. 5:  Did reliance legally cause her     
03:53:54
11  death?  Well, the issue there is would more information have   
03:54:00
12  made a difference, because that's the question.  Well, you     
03:54:04
13  heard the evidence.  She knew cigarettes were dangerous.  She  
03:54:07
14  was familiar with the packs.  She heard they were cancer       
03:54:10
15  sticks.  Her family warned her.  More information wouldn't     
03:54:13
16  have made a difference to Mrs. Graham.  That's why the answer  
03:54:16
17  to that is no. 03:54:19
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
18             She said cigarettes were cancer sticks.             
03:54:20
19             What would have made a difference?                  
03:54:23
20             The answer to that is no.  And the same thing for   
03:54:25
21  Reynolds. 03:54:29
22             Question 6 and 7, conspiracy to conceal.  That's    
03:54:29
23  like the concealment claim, we just talked about that.  They   
03:54:32
24  are the same issues.  Reliance, would more information have    
03:54:36
25  made a difference. 03:54:39 251
1             The answer to that question is no, for the same     
03:54:39
2  reasons we just talked about.  No reliance or more             
03:54:42
3  information would have made a difference.                      
03:54:46
4             Again, the same thing for Reynolds.  The answer is  
03:54:48
5  no.   03:54:49
6             No. 8, the percentage of responsibility.  If the    
03:54:50
7  answer to 1 or 2 is no, you don't get to this question.  You   
03:54:53
8  don't start balancing if 1 or 2 is no.                         
03:54:57
9             If you do, ask this question:  Who could have       
03:55:00
10  caused Mrs. Graham to stop smoking?                            
03:55:02
11             There is only one person, and that's Mrs. Graham,   
03:55:05
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
12  and that's why it's 100 percent for her.                       
03:55:07
13             Now, let's go to Question 10.  The punitive         
03:55:09
14  damages claim.  And the question here is:  Did the plaintiff   
03:55:14
15  prove by evidence that is clear and convincing that punitive   
03:55:17
16  damages are warranted against the companies?                   
03:55:22
17             Okay.  Well, the question here is this:  Punitive   
03:55:25
18  damages award money beyond what is necessary to compensate.    
03:55:30
19  The question is, is this a case for that?                      
03:55:33
20             The punitive damage claim under the instructions    
03:55:36
21  is derivative of the concealment claim.  The issues are the    
03:55:38
22  same.  Here the evidence must be by clear and convincing       
03:55:43
23  evidence.  Was there reliance?  No.  Would more information    
03:55:45
24  have made a difference?  No.  It's the same analysis.          
03:55:49
25             So the answer to this question is no.               
03:55:53 252
1             I think that you'll see when you look at the        
03:55:56
2  evidence, this isn't a case for awarding extra damages to the  
03:55:58
3  plaintiff. 03:56:03
4             The same analysis applies to Reynolds.              
03:56:03
5             Just about finished.  I want to talk to you about   
03:56:06
6  cigarette design.  You just heard about this.  Dr. Cummings,   
03:56:10
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
7  their expert, who wanted you to think, and spent a lot of      
03:56:14
8  time on this issue, that the companies design cigarettes to    
03:56:19
9  make them more addictive.  You heard a lot about that, and     
03:56:22
10  this is what he said.  Cigarettes today are not more           
03:56:26
11  addictive than they were in the '50s.  And that's their        
03:56:28
12  witness, Dr. Cummings. 03:56:31
13             And that answers a lot of issues in this case.      
03:56:32
14             Now, I'm just about finished.  I know that's the    
03:56:36
15  case.  All right.  I'm just about finished.                    
03:56:40
16             But the plaintiff is going to get one last chance   
03:56:45
17  to talk to you.  And that's fine, because the plaintiff has    
03:56:47
18  the burden of proof. 03:56:50
19             When the plaintiff gets up here and talks to you,   
03:56:51
20  I want you to think about the evidence we have talked about.   
03:56:53
21  The fact that Mrs. Graham was a very determined, capable,      
03:56:57
22  intelligent person.  The fact that she was not motivated to    
03:57:02
23  quit.  She didn't want to.  Barbara told you that.  And who    
03:57:05
24  knew her better than her?  Nobody.  That's who.                
03:57:09
25             We know that Mrs. Graham was definitely aware of    
03:57:13 253
1  the health risks of smoking.  Her husband warned her.  He      
03:57:16
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
2  asked her to quit.  He quit in 1980, and then he started       
03:57:20
3  asking her to quit, and she wanted no part of it.  She wanted  
03:57:24
4  no part of it. 03:57:28
5             She said, Let's light up some of those cancer       
03:57:29
6  sticks.  03:57:32
7             I want to say this:  I'm not here to criticize her  
03:57:33
8  choices.  That's not what this is about.  But this case is     
03:57:36
9  about whether she knew about the health risks of smoking.      
03:57:39
10  She knew what was on the warnings.  She knew that cigarettes   
03:57:42
11  were cancer sticks, and more information wouldn't have made a  
03:57:45
12  difference, and that's what this case is all about.            
03:57:48
13             The concealment, the conspiracy claim, the          
03:57:50
14  punitive damage claim is about that.  Would more information   
03:57:52
15  have made a difference?  And the answer is no.                 
03:57:55
16             When you hear about design, think about what        
03:57:58
17  Dr. Cummings said.  Because that answers a lot of the          
03:58:01
18  questions in this case.  03:58:04
19             Now, when they talk to you, I want you to think     
03:58:05
20  about this:  Think about that evidence and think about what    
03:58:08
21  Ms. Parker would say, think about Mr. Walker's                 
03:58:11
22  cross-examination of Dr. Feingold and what you learned from    
03:58:14
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
23  that. 03:58:18
24             You might think about what I might say about it as  
03:58:18
25  well, and look at the Court's instructions.                    
03:58:21 254
1             Now, I know it's almost time to finish.  Under the  
03:58:23
2  evidence, the claims are not proof.  These facts don't fit     
03:58:30
3  the claims, and because of that, the answer to all the         
03:58:32
4  questions before you is no.                                    
03:58:35
5             Thank you very much.
