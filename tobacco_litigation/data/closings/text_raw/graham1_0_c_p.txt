19             MR. BYRD:  May it please the Court?                 
02:02:10
20             Members of the jury, thank you so much for your     
02:02:12
21  time this past week or so.  We thank you, my colleague,        
02:02:17
22  Mr. Lantinberg, and myself thank you for your time, and        
02:02:22
23  certainly our client, Mr. Earl Graham, thanks you for the      
02:02:26
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
24  time that you spent in listening to the evidence and hearing   
02:02:29
25  the facts in the case. 02:02:32 171
1             When you go back to the room to deliberate, you     
02:02:34
2  are essentially going to have three jobs we would submit.      
02:02:38
3  You are going to answer questions on a verdict form.  You are  
02:02:41
4  going to talk amongst each other and try to make sure          
02:02:45
5  everybody follows the instructions that the Judge gives you.   
02:02:48
6             And before you answer, before you -- you're going   
02:02:51
7  to get to all talk together and make sure everybody has a      
02:02:54
8  chance to explain why they feel the way they feel, and then    
02:02:57
9  you are going to come to your conclusions.                     
02:03:02
10             So for the next 30 or 40 minutes here, I want to    
02:03:04
11  try to offer you some ways and some suggestions about how we   
02:03:07
12  view the evidence in this case.                                
02:03:11
13             If you remember when you first came here and were   
02:03:12
14  selected by the jury and everybody sat back there, made some   
02:03:17
15  commitments.  In jury selection, you were asked by the Judge   
02:03:20
16  and there were questions asked by myself and Ms. Parker about  
02:03:23
17  biases and any biases you had.                                 
02:03:29
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
18             And you told this Court that you could remove       
02:03:31
19  those.  And you told this Court that things like if it was --  
02:03:34
20  if you thought, well, I just don't believe that plaintiffs     
02:03:38
21  should be able to sue for things like this, for somebody       
02:03:41
22  that's something they chose to do.  I just don't believe in    
02:03:44
23  that.  Or I don't believe giving money to somebody that chose  
02:03:47
24  to smoke tobacco and then sue the companies who did that.      
02:03:50
25  Everybody answered those questions, and said those kind of     
02:03:54 172
1  biases and feelings you did not have and were not going to     
02:03:57
2  come into play in this courtroom.                              
02:03:59
3             So we would ask -- thank you for that commitment    
02:04:02
4  and make sure in the jury deliberation room that everybody     
02:04:04
5  just focuses on the facts and the evidence that came in.  And  
02:04:07
6  if there are any of the outside biases or reasons, that those  
02:04:10
7  aren't reasons.  Because you've explained to the Court that    
02:04:13
8  you didn't have those kind of biases.  Those would not come    
02:04:16
9  into your deliberations. 02:04:19
10             You may wonder from time to time about evidence     
02:04:20
11  you didn't hear about, things that we are not able to tell     
02:04:23
12  you.  And the Court has rules about that.  There are rules of  
02:04:25
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
13  what kind of evidence both Ms. Parker and myself can give you  
02:04:28
14  and tell you about. 02:04:31
15             And you don't need to wonder about things you       
02:04:32
16  didn't hear, because that -- or make up ideas or guess about   
02:04:35
17  why you didn't hear about things like that.  Just consider     
02:04:39
18  the evidence, and then we will appreciate all the service      
02:04:41
19  that you've given us to give us our shake here.                
02:04:45
20             Now, when we started, Mr. Lantinberg explained in   
02:04:48
21  his opening statement about why we are here and why we were    
02:04:51
22  suing the cigarette company, and he mentioned a few reasons    
02:04:55
23  why we are suing the cigarette companies.                      
02:04:58
24             One is that we were suing the cigarette companies   
02:04:59
25  because we submit that they violated basic safety concepts     
02:05:02 173
1  that a company can never lie about a danger it knows about in  
02:05:07
2  a product. 02:05:12
3             Now, you heard some of the men in the video from    
02:05:13
4  the very cigarette companies.  You heard Mr. Colby.  He had    
02:05:17
5  the transcript underneath him.  He was hard to understand.     
02:05:22
6  He said the cigarette company has a duty to be truthful and    
02:05:27
7  not to mislead. 02:05:30
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
8             Mr. Heimann, one of the first videos you saw.       
02:05:32
9  Remember, he was the guy who got up there and said, you know,  
02:05:35
10  he disagreed with every medical public authority, all these    
02:05:38
11  medical groups, American Medical Association, anybody who      
02:05:43
12  said cigarettes were injurious.  He just didn't believe it.    
02:05:45
13  They were all wrong.  They are all dead wrong.  And he said    
02:05:48
14  that our advertising is truthful.  And we expect people to     
02:05:51
15  rely on it. 02:05:56
16             Now, that's one reason we are coming in here.       
02:05:57
17             Another reason is that the cigarette companies      
02:06:01
18  violated another rule that we believe, a safety concept, if    
02:06:04
19  you will, about not lying about the dangers that it knows      
02:06:07
20  about. 02:06:10
21             So the cigarette companies, we submit, lied about   
02:06:12
22  the fact that cigarettes cause cancer.  They lied about that   
02:06:17
23  cigarettes are addictive.  The cigarette companies lied about  
02:06:22
24  the fact that filters, things like filters, were somehow       
02:06:25
25  safer.  The cigarette companies lied about the fact that       
02:06:28 174
1  light cigarettes or low-tar cigarettes were somehow safer.     
02:06:32
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
2  Not only did they mislead the public at large, they misled     
02:06:36
3  the public health authorities about that.                      
02:06:39
4             And the cigarette companies lied about the fact     
02:06:42
5  that, you know, low-nicotine products were somehow any less    
02:06:45
6  addictive than the regular cigarettes that they made.          
02:06:49
7             The proof of this comes in straight from their own  
02:06:53
8  records, their own business records.  And we are going to      
02:06:55
9  talk about the timeline in a minute.                           
02:06:57
10             But about when those business records came out, I   
02:07:00
11  will say this:  When those business records came out -- and    
02:07:02
12  you heard Dr. Gentry from R.J. Reynolds say they came out in   
02:07:06
13  1998, formerly unknown, formerly not obtained.  No one could   
02:07:10
14  get them, because they were internal.  Many of them stamped    
02:07:18
15  confidential you saw.  No one was able to get them.            
02:07:18
16             It changed the landscape of what people knew about  
02:07:20
17  the cigarette industry and understood about what they had      
02:07:23
18  been doing for so long.  And we are going to talk about that.  
02:07:28
19  But that is a pivotal moment in the late '90s when the truth   
02:07:30
20  finally comes out. 02:07:35
21             Now, another reason we sued, we mentioned, is the   
02:07:36
22  cigarette companies violated this concept that a manufacturer  
02:07:40
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
23  should never hide a danger it knows about in its product.      
02:07:42
24  And the cigarette companies, we will show you, as we showed    
02:07:47
25  on the timeline, studies addiction for a long time.  And,      
02:07:50 175
1  remember, they didn't even admit that cigarettes were          
02:07:56
2  addictive until 1999.  And we will talk about what they say    
02:07:58
3  about addiction now.  Dr. Gentry and Jupe.  They won't admit   
02:08:01
4  addiction causes disease now, but they didn't even admit       
02:08:05
5  cigarettes were addictive until 1999.                          
02:08:08
6             Yet, their own documents show back in the 1960s,    
02:08:11
7  they started mastering the concept, the ability to rig and     
02:08:17
8  engineer this product into a nicotine delivery system that     
02:08:21
9  was designed to addict, designed to keep people from being     
02:08:25
10  able to stop.  And they even know -- this whole time they      
02:08:29
11  know most of our customers would rather quit.  Most of         
02:08:33
12  them -- in their own documents, they say that.  Most of them   
02:08:37
13  wish they could quit.  Now, that doesn't sound like free       
02:08:40
14  choice to me. 02:08:45
15             If there is a product that you want to stop buying  
02:08:46
16  and you have to go start getting safety aids and drugs and     
02:08:50
17  things to stop being able to buy -- let's say you want to buy  
02:08:54
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
18  a red car instead a blue car.  That's a choice.  Nothing       
02:08:58
19  stopping you from doing that.                                  
02:09:02
20             Most of their customers wanted to quit, and they    
02:09:03
21  knew it, and they could not.                                   
02:09:05
22             We are going to hear arguments from the cigarette   
02:09:07
23  companies that this is about free choice.                      
02:09:10
24             So I would ask you, as we go forward, to have this  
02:09:11
25  concept of what kind of choice are we talking about as we go   
02:09:15 176
1  forward in this case.  02:09:20
2             Now, the final reason we had to sue was because     
02:09:23
3  the cigarette companies have not provided any full and fair    
02:09:26
4  compensation. 02:09:29
5             MS. PARKER:  Objection, your Honor.                 
02:09:30
6             THE COURT:  Sustained.                              
02:09:31
7             MR. BYRD:  We are here in order to receive full     
02:09:32
8  and fair compensation for Mr. Graham.                          
02:09:34
9             Now, I want to talk a little bit about the jury     
02:09:37
10  instructions. 02:09:42
11             I've asked -- Mr. Lantinberg is going to go over    
02:09:42
12  to the ELMO with these to the extent we need to show a few.    
02:09:45
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
13             I want to show you a little bit about the jury      
02:09:49
14  instructions that the Judge is going to read to you.  You'll   
02:09:51
15  have them back in the jury room.  And I believe everybody      
02:09:54
16  will have their own copy so they can look at the jury          
02:09:56
17  instructions themselves. 02:10:00
18             I want to point out a few things.  The first thing  
02:10:00
19  I want to point out is actually on the first page.  It talks   
02:10:02
20  about what kind of evidence you can consider, at the bottom.   
02:10:05
21             And if you will see down in the bottom, it says,    
02:10:09
22  In your deliberations, you should consider only the evidence.  
02:10:13
23  And that's what we have talked about.                          
02:10:16
24             And it goes on to say, But as you consider the      
02:10:17
25  evidence, both direct and circumstantial, you may make         
02:10:19 177
1  deductions and reach conclusions which reason and common       
02:10:23
2  sense lead you to make.  02:10:28
3             I want to point that out.  Because the Judge will   
02:10:30
4  instruct you about what we have to prove just if you want      
02:10:33
5  to -- just more than 50 percent, more likely right than        
02:10:37
6  wrong.  This is not some beyond a reasonable doubt where we    
02:10:41
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
7  have removed every question.                                   
02:10:43
8             He will explain to you what we have to prove.  And  
02:10:44
9  you can use your common sense.                                 
02:10:46
10             I'm not talking about the kind of common sense      
02:10:48
11  that we heard from the Philip Morris executives at the end of  
02:10:50
12  the case:  Apple sauce can kill you.  I know that sounds       
02:10:53
13  "logical." 02:10:58
14             I'm talking about common sense from the evidence    
02:10:59
15  that you see in the documents that we will submit to you --    
02:11:01
16  you will have back there, and we would submit that you should  
02:11:05
17  read. 02:11:08
18             I will point out some of the ones that we suggest   
02:11:08
19  you really focus on and read.  I'm talking about that kind of  
02:11:11
20  common sense. 02:11:15
21             And then the Judge will go on to tell you about     
02:11:15
22  direct evidence.  Direct evidence is the testimony of one who  
02:11:17
23  asserts actual knowledge of a fact such as an eyewitness.      
02:11:21
24             But there is also circumstantial evidence, which    
02:11:24
25  is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances tending to      
02:11:27 178
1  prove or disprove any fact in dispute.                         
02:11:32
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
2             And the next line is what's extremely important.    
02:11:35
3  The law makes no distinction between the weight you may give   
02:11:38
4  to either direct or circumstantial evidence.  You give them    
02:11:42
5  the same weight.  Circumstantial evidence can be used just     
02:11:45
6  like the direct evidence can be used.                          
02:11:49
7             We would submit as an example the cigarette         
02:11:51
8  companies touting lights and low tars everywhere become one    
02:11:57
9  of the highest selling products.  They are advertising it all  
02:12:00
10  over the place.  Lo and behold around the same time,           
02:12:04
11  Mrs. Graham starts to smoke light and low-tar cigarettes.  Do  
02:12:08
12  we have direct evidence that she saw an advertisement and      
02:12:12
13  relied on it?  I think so.  But it's kind of tough.            
02:12:14
14             Mrs. Graham has died.  She is not here.  She was    
02:12:19
15  not able to be interviewed.  We can't tell you what was in     
02:12:23
16  her mind because this case came about after that.              
02:12:28
17             So you can use circumstantial evidence she started  
02:12:32
18  smoking lights and low tars while they are making all these    
02:12:36
19  health claims while she is wanting to quit and infer that      
02:12:38
20  indeed she did rely on the things that the cigarette           
02:12:43
21  companies did to push that.                                    
02:12:46
22             I would ask you to consider that as you go forward  
02:12:49
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
23  and look at the facts in the case.                             
02:12:50
24             Now, the next instruction talks about --            
02:12:53
25  Instruction No. 5, Page 7, talks about what we have to prove.  
02:13:02 179
1  The preponderance of the evidence.  You've heard this a        
02:13:06
2  little bit.  This is not a criminal case.  This is what you    
02:13:08
3  have to prove in a civil case such as this.                    
02:13:10
4             Preponderance of the evidence simply means an       
02:13:12
5  amount of evidence that is enough to persuade you that         
02:13:17
6  Mr. Graham's claim is more likely true than not true.  More    
02:13:21
7  likely true than not.  02:13:25
8             In deciding whether -- well, that's where we come   
02:13:27
9  up with this concept.  We don't have to go a hundred percent   
02:13:33
10  of the way.  Imagine a football field.  You get to the         
02:13:35
11  50-yard line, you get just an inch over the 50-yard line, we   
02:13:39
12  have proved our claim.  And we don't have to go all the way    
02:13:43
13  to the 100-yard line, the goal line.  We get right over the    
02:13:46
14  50-yard line and we have proved our claim.  We are more        
02:13:51
15  likely true than not, with common sense.                       
02:13:53
16             So if in deliberations someone says, You know, I    
02:13:56
17  have some doubts.  I have some doubts.  I heard about this --  
02:14:02
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
18  well, they mentioned breast cancer.  I have a doubt.           
02:14:05
19             Well, remind them, we have to look at the evidence  
02:14:08
20  and say what was more likely right than not and remind them    
02:14:10
21  that we don't have to prove all doubt.  We don't have to       
02:14:14
22  remove all doubt, because the Judge will instruct you that we  
02:14:17
23  don't have to remove every piece of doubt.  We just have to    
02:14:20
24  prove by a preponderance of the evidence.                      
02:14:24
25             So let's look at the verdict form.  Before we do,   
02:14:26 180
1  if I may, I would submit the -- basically two avenues, two     
02:14:29
2  routes of things to consider in the verdict form.  I want to   
02:14:35
3  draw this right up here. 02:14:38
4             The first question you are going to be asked --     
02:14:40
5  and we will look at it in a second, and I think the Judge      
02:14:43
6  will show you it -- is whether Faye Graham was addicted.       
02:14:46
7  That's the first question you'll be asked.                     
02:14:52
8             The next question will be whether addiction caused  
02:14:55
9  the disease.  02:14:59
10             We submit this is lung cancer.  Addiction caused    
02:15:03
11  lung cancer and her death.                                     
02:15:07
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
12             Okay.  And then the final piece of that whole       
02:15:10
13  puzzle down that avenue, you will be asked to decide what's    
02:15:15
14  called comparative fault.  The fault of all the parties.       
02:15:18
15  Come in with -- you know, imagine everybody has shared         
02:15:22
16  responsibility.  We are going to look at this and we are       
02:15:24
17  going to see who has what amount of fault.  We will call that  
02:15:26
18  comparative fault. 02:15:31
19             So I will talk more about this later, this concept  
02:15:34
20  later. 02:15:39
21             But I'm going to address the addicted and the       
02:15:39
22  addiction causing lung cancer first.                           
02:15:42
23             My next half of what I would like to talk about is  
02:15:45
24  the other avenue that you are going to have to deal with on    
02:15:47
25  the verdict form, which are what we call the intentional tort  
02:15:50 181
1  claims.  Concealment, we will call it for short.               
02:15:53
2             We claim that the defendants concealed and omitted  
02:15:56
3  material facts.  The Engle findings have something to say      
02:15:59
4  about all those.  And I will point to those in a second.       
02:16:03
5             The next claim will be conspiracy, that the         
02:16:06
6  defendants engaged in an agreement together.  We submit        
02:16:11
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
7  starting at the Plaza Hotel in 1953, which continued all the   
02:16:14
8  way until Faye Graham died and beyond.                         
02:16:19
9             And then if you answer yes to those two questions,  
02:16:22
10  we will address punitive damages.                              
02:16:31
11             We suggest that where the rubber really meets the   
02:16:32
12  road in this case is punitive damages.  And this is a case     
02:16:37
13  about punitive damages.  There is no competent evidence        
02:16:39
14  anywhere that came into this courtroom to question this side   
02:16:45
15  right here of the verdict form.                                
02:16:49
16             Let's start with that.                              
02:16:50
17             Show the first question on the verdict form.        
02:16:53
18  Let's do that. 02:17:03
19             The very first question on the verdict form will    
02:17:04
20  say, Was Faye Graham addicted to cigarettes containing         
02:17:07
21  nicotine?  Okay.  02:17:10
22             So, remember, we have to prove this more likely     
02:17:12
23  right than wrong.  I think we would submit there is no         
02:17:14
24  question about this. 02:17:17
25             What did you hear in the case?  Dr. Feingold came   
02:17:18 182
1  in and he concluded, you know, without any doubt at all that   
02:17:21
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
2  Faye Graham was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine.    
02:17:26
3             You heard from Dr. Cummings as well as              
02:17:29
4  Dr. Feingold how nicotine works on the brain.                  
02:17:32
5             They have spent decades studying this and           
02:17:35
6  researching this field.  02:17:38
7             Dr. Cummings has published countless articles in    
02:17:40
8  the Surgeon General -- he's edited Surgeon General Reports.    
02:17:44
9  He has done peer-reviewed articles on this topic.  He          
02:17:48
10  helps -- actually helps addicted smokers try to quit smoking.  
02:17:51
11             By the way, we happen to know Faye Graham was not   
02:17:55
12  unlike other customers of the cigarette companies.  She was    
02:18:01
13  just like most of them.  She wanted to quit and could not.     
02:18:04
14  Smoked until the day she died.  After her lung cancer,         
02:18:07
15  receiving radiation and chemotherapy treatment, continued to   
02:18:14
16  smoke. 02:18:17
17             Now, you've heard evidence about the definition of  
02:18:19
18  addiction.  Addiction, as you heard from the experts in this   
02:18:21
19  case, chronic relapsing brain disease, compulsive use despite  
02:18:26
20  harmful consequences.  That's the rough definition.  This is   
02:18:33
21  a chronic relapsing brain disease, compulsive use despite      
02:18:36
22  harmful consequences.  02:18:41
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
23             Dr. Feingold explained how cigarettes pass through  
02:18:43
24  the blood brain barrier, okay, which we are all born with,     
02:18:46
25  all created with.  Nicotine can get past that and make         
02:18:50 183
1  changes to your actual brain structures and grow these         
02:18:55
2  nicotine receptors, multiple of them in this thing called      
02:18:59
3  up-regulation, as Dr. Cummings talked about.                   
02:19:03
4             Nicotine receptors multiplying in the brain.        
02:19:07
5             Dr. Feingold explained in great deal about how      
02:19:10
6  nicotine gets from the lung within a matter of seconds up to   
02:19:12
7  the brain and how the nicotine receptors start craving this    
02:19:16
8  nicotine and demand more and more.                             
02:19:21
9             And then he told you how he concluded more likely   
02:19:22
10  right than wrong that Faye Graham was addicted.  He read --    
02:19:26
11  he didn't need to read all the depositions in this case.       
02:19:29
12             By the way, we will talk about the witnesses in     
02:19:32
13  this case.  The defendants did not bring one witness into      
02:19:35
14  this courtroom.  These family witnesses that they mentioned    
02:19:38
15  to Dr. Feingold, didn't bring one witness into this courtroom  
02:19:42
16  to deny any fact at all that went to addiction and whether     
02:19:45
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
17  she was addicted.  How much she smoked first thing in the      
02:19:49
18  morning.  Did not bring one witness to contradict that in      
02:19:52
19  this case, now, despite she smoked one to two packs a day for  
02:19:58
20  more than 40 years.  You heard Mr. Herrin talk about she       
02:20:03
21  started smoking, I saw it, when she was in her mid-teenage     
02:20:06
22  years.  He was clear about that.                               
02:20:10
23             Lo and behold, she had also told him, I started     
02:20:11
24  smoking when I was 16. 02:20:15
25             And so she is not here, but we think the evidence   
02:20:17 184
1  shows she started way back in 1951 when she was 16 years old.  
02:20:21
2             Smoked for roughly 40-some-odd years.               
02:20:28
3             Dr. Feingold talked about how that means she's had  
02:20:32
4  5.5 million puffs of nicotine, self-administered doses of      
02:20:36
5  nicotine, to the brain.  And every time she puffed in, every   
02:20:43
6  single time, 5.5 million carcinogens flowing through to the    
02:20:47
7  lungs. 02:20:54
8             You heard this compulsive use despite knowing       
02:20:54
9  harmful consequences.  Faye Graham tried all sorts of ways to  
02:21:01
10  quit.  She tried chewing gum.  She tried hypnosis.  Spent a    
02:21:05
11  lot of money for that family for a few days of actual          
02:21:10
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
12  earnings to go try hypnosis, and it didn't work long at all,   
02:21:14
13  but she tried over and over.  She wanted to quit.  Her         
02:21:18
14  husband asked her to quit.                                     
02:21:21
15             Of course, she knew that there were some harmful    
02:21:23
16  consequences to smoking.  She was desperate to quit.  We are   
02:21:26
17  not here to tell you she had no clue these things were bad     
02:21:31
18  for her at all.  I don't think she understood the full extent  
02:21:35
19  of it.  I don't think she understood the full extent of it     
02:21:38
20  until much later, but, of course, eventually by the '70s or    
02:21:41
21  '80s, she is trying to quit.  She didn't want to be smoking.   
02:21:45
22             Finally, Dr. Feingold said she smoked first thing   
02:21:48
23  in the morning.  That's one of the biggest signs, because      
02:21:53
24  your nicotine receptors are empty and they are screaming       
02:21:56
25  first thing in the morning.                                    
02:21:58 185
1             And you heard Earl Graham testify, who was          
02:22:00
2  actually in the same bedroom with her overnight.  You heard    
02:22:02
3  Earl Graham testify that that would be the first thing when    
02:22:05
4  her feet hit the floor; when her feet hit the floor, she       
02:22:09
5  would start smoking.  Last thing she did when she went to bed  
02:22:11
6  at night.  Every time he saw her, she had a cigarette in her   
02:22:15
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
7  hand from the first time he met her.                           
02:22:18
8             This is the picture of addiction.  This is not      
02:22:20
9  smoking just because you like it.                              
02:22:25
10             And you can read in the 2010 Surgeon General's      
02:22:27
11  Report.  It's Exhibit 237.  We submit this is an exhibit       
02:22:32
12  worth perusing.  You'll actually have your own copy of it      
02:22:36
13  back there. 02:22:39
14             It looks like this.                                 
02:22:40
15             There are a couple of chapters worth perusing.      
02:22:43
16  Exhibit 237.  Talking about the changing design of the         
02:22:46
17  cigarette and what that did and talking about nicotine         
02:22:50
18  addiction.  We have heard it all -- the end of yesterday and   
02:22:52
19  today, nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason.           
02:22:55
20             No, maybe it's A.  I don't know.                    
02:22:58
21             Nicotine is the fundamental reason people smoke     
02:23:00
22  and leads to disease.  And that's what the Surgeon General     
02:23:04
23  Report says.  02:23:07
24             And if this addiction concept is so unbelievable    
02:23:08
25  and so remarkable that Mrs. Graham couldn't be addicted --     
02:23:18 186
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
1  you know, we believe generally that somebody could be          
02:23:23
2  addicted, but it's not Mrs. Graham.  Not Mrs. Graham in this   
02:23:26
3  case. 02:23:30
4             If not that many people are addicted out there,     
02:23:31
5  then why -- why did the cigarette companies have in 1985,      
02:23:33
6  1984 and '85, why were they so concerned about Nicorette gum   
02:23:41
7  coming out?  If it's such a free choice, and if you can just   
02:23:46
8  lay them down, then why do they need to be concerned about     
02:23:50
9  Nicorette gum hitting the market and hitting their customers?  
02:23:55
10             By the way, what about the free choice to use       
02:24:00
11  Nicorette gum?  Is that free choice to stop that from getting  
02:24:04
12  to the market or trying to stop it from getting to the         
02:24:07
13  market?  You can make it, but don't advertise it to our        
02:24:10
14  customers. 02:24:14
15             And you saw those documents.  Those are internal    
02:24:14
16  records that had never come out before.  You are somebody --   
02:24:16
17  the few people who have seen this.  You can go onto a website  
02:24:20
18  now, database, and find all these documents.  You don't do     
02:24:25
19  that while you are deliberating, but down the road anybody     
02:24:29
20  can do that.  02:24:31
21             But nobody knew about this until these documents    
02:24:32
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
22  came out that this is the kind of behavior they were doing.    
02:24:37
23  And they still denied cigarettes were addictive in 1984 when   
02:24:39
24  they were telling Dow Chemicals, No, no, no, we are going to   
02:24:43
25  stop dealing with you if you start doing this Nicorette gum    
02:24:47 187
1  thing. 02:24:50
2             Now, is it more likely right than wrong that Faye   
02:24:51
3  Graham was addicted?  Yes.  You heard no evidence to say       
02:24:56
4  otherwise.  Earl Graham testified.  Charles Herrin testified.  
02:25:00
5  Barbara Beaty testified about seeing her smoke.                
02:25:04
6             We will talk about Barbara in a minute, because     
02:25:06
7  she had a couple of other things to say.                       
02:25:08
8             Let's go on to the next question.  Question 2 will  
02:25:15
9  be:  Was Faye Graham's addiction to cigarettes containing      
02:25:20
10  nicotine a legal cause of her death?                           
02:25:23
11             Now, you are going to have an instruction about     
02:25:25
12  legal cause.  And it is No. 9.  I believe there is an          
02:25:33
13  instruction on addiction being the cause.                      
02:25:55
14             No. 7.  Page 9.  Page 9 at the bottom.  In order    
02:26:04
15  to prove that addiction to smoking cigarettes containing       
02:26:28
16  nicotine was a legal cause of Mrs. Graham's death, Mr. Graham  
02:26:31
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
17  must prove that such addiction directly and in natural and     
02:26:35
18  continuous sequence produced or contributed substantially to   
02:26:39
19  producing such death so it can be reasonably said but for the  
02:26:43
20  addiction, the death would not have occurred.  In order to be  
02:26:47
21  regarded as a legal cause of death, addiction need not be the  
02:26:50
22  only cause.  Addiction may be a legal cause of death even      
02:26:53
23  though it operates in combination with the act of another,     
02:26:57
24  some natural cause, or some other cause if the addiction       
02:27:00
25  contributes substantially to producing such death.             
02:27:04 188
1             So there you have it.  Addiction need not be the    
02:27:09
2  only cause.  It just needs to be a cause that substantially    
02:27:13
3  contributed to causing her death.                              
02:27:16
4             And how did it cause her death?  You heard from     
02:27:17
5  Dr. Feingold.  We are created in an amazing way.  The blood    
02:27:21
6  brain barrier, it's supposed to keep chemicals out.  Except    
02:27:28
7  it doesn't work on nicotine.  Nicotine gets through.           
02:27:30
8             Our lungs -- you heard him explain the lungs --     
02:27:32
9  have these bronchial tubes that come out and they are filled   
02:27:35
10  with all this blood, all these vessels, going everywhere, and  
02:27:38
11  these bronchial trees develop.  And if you were to take the    
02:27:42
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
12  leaves of these trees -- this is where air hits in the lung    
02:27:48
13  and you breathe in -- take the leaves of these trees and       
02:27:51
14  spread them out, it would be as large as a tennis court.  We   
02:27:55
15  have things inside us that are as large as a tennis court for  
02:27:58
16  breathing.  We are made in an amazing way.                     
02:28:02
17             And Dr. Feingold talked about how cigarettes come   
02:28:03
18  in and are designed to defeat the very way we are made to      
02:28:07
19  deflect things like this that happen to us.                    
02:28:13
20             What happens is we have cilia in the lungs that     
02:28:15
21  operate to try to remove chemicals and toxins that come in     
02:28:19
22  and pushes it up and out and gets rid of it.  Until you smoke  
02:28:23
23  cigarettes -- and the cigarettes, what do they do?  They       
02:28:27
24  bring in carcinogens that freeze the cilia.  Your cilia can't  
02:28:31
25  do that action that it normally does, which is designed to     
02:28:36 189
1  do, and is completely defeated.                                
02:28:39
2             And Dr. Feingold explained how repeated exposure    
02:28:41
3  to cigarettes, over and over and over, is what leads to the    
02:28:43
4  cancer and what leads to the cells being in such a way to set  
02:28:49
5  the stage for mutation to occur where cancer develops, and     
02:28:55
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
6  then because of all the blood vessels in there, it breaks up.  
02:28:58
7  It breaks off into the bloodstream and moves on into other     
02:29:04
8  organs of the body, including the brain.  And that's what she  
02:29:09
9  had.  02:29:12
10             Now, the defendants will talk about, oh, this lung  
02:29:14
11  cancer came from somewhere else.  Dr. Feingold came in here.   
02:29:17
12  And they did not bring you one person.  They had a lot to say  
02:29:20
13  about Dr. Feingold.  They don't like him.  He makes money.     
02:29:23
14  Have a lot to criticize him about.  And if there was anybody   
02:29:26
15  on the defense side who had tested these slides like           
02:29:30
16  Dr. Feingold, and who had looked at the slides like            
02:29:34
17  Dr. Feingold, who could come in here and actually show you     
02:29:38
18  with science this wasn't lung cancer, trust me, you would      
02:29:40
19  have heard it.  And you didn't.                                
02:29:43
20             Dr. Feingold came in here and he explained, he      
02:29:46
21  went through the medical records in detail that this is        
02:29:49
22  adenocarcinoma. 02:29:52
23             What happened?  What happened?  They looked at      
02:29:53
24  this.  They took a biopsy.  And, yes, there are different      
02:29:57
25  options of where this could come from.  And what is one of     
02:30:01 190
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
1  the first things they do?  A mammogram, an x-ray of the        
02:30:03
2  breast, and see no cancer whatsoever.                          
02:30:07
3             They even go as far as to do a female -- a doctor   
02:30:09
4  comes in and does an actual physical test of the breasts.  No  
02:30:12
5  cancer.  02:30:16
6             He said if this had been breast cancer, this would  
02:30:16
7  have gone -- this would have gone -- wouldn't have spread to   
02:30:18
8  the brain like that.  He said there is no question this was    
02:30:22
9  lung cancer.  Look at the medical records.                     
02:30:24
10             The medical records will be in evidence.  They are  
02:30:26
11  Exhibit 1362 from plaintiffs.  Look through them.  We showed   
02:30:29
12  you all of them.  02:30:33
13             Defendants, their exhibit, they are going to have   
02:30:35
14  a medical record exhibit, too.  I don't know what number it    
02:30:38
15  is.  It has two pages.  Because they don't want you to see     
02:30:41
16  all the medical records. 02:30:43
17             Look at our medical records.  It has all of them    
02:30:44
18  in there. 02:30:47
19             And then look at Exhibit 1365.  Those are the       
02:30:47
20  photomicrographs that Dr. Feingold showed you.  And he showed  
02:30:51
21  you what he saw.  Lung cancer.  And then he went a step        
02:30:53
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
22  further.  You know, we just have to go to the 50-yard line on  
02:30:56
23  the football field.  He went all the way to the goal line.     
02:30:59
24             He took a TTF-1 test, okay.  And nothing was        
02:31:02
25  stopping defendants from doing these same tests.  Defendants   
02:31:07 191
1  had every opportunity to have -- they had everything           
02:31:11
2  available to them that we did.                                 
02:31:13
3             And he went and did this test.  And after the       
02:31:15
4  TTF-1, he says, it confirms exactly what all the treating      
02:31:19
5  doctors say.  TTF-1, 99 percent sure this is lung cancer, not  
02:31:23
6  from somewhere else, not from GI tract, not from               
02:31:27
7  reproductive, lung cancer.                                     
02:31:30
8             Then he goes a step further.  Crosses the goal      
02:31:32
9  line.  Takes a napsin A test to completely remove any doubt.   
02:31:34
10  Says we are done.  Sat down and said we are done, a hundred    
02:31:38
11  percent conclusive. 02:31:42
12             They have done nothing to bring that back from the  
02:31:43
13  goal line to the 50-yard line, much less the other way.  This  
02:31:45
14  is lung cancer. 02:31:48
15             The death certificate, Exhibit 1351.                
02:31:49
16             Edward, bring that up, please.                      
02:31:52
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
17             The death certificate says, non-small cell lung     
02:31:55
18  cancer with brain metastasis.  Exactly what Dr. Feingold saw.  
02:32:07
19  Exactly what she had.  And after all the tests, the doctors    
02:32:11
20  all agreed. 02:32:14
21             Now, the next question you are going to face on     
02:32:15
22  the jury instruction form is whether smoking cigarettes of     
02:32:17
23  Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds were the legal cause.          
02:32:20
24             Well, okay, that's obvious.                         
02:32:23
25             We read you the stipulations.  All the brands you   
02:32:24 192
1  heard about, from Charles Herrin, from Barbara Beaty, who      
02:32:27
2  listed some brands as well, and from Earl Graham, all of       
02:32:31
3  these brands are Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.              
02:32:37
4             And Dr. Feingold -- you remember it was that        
02:32:39
5  question I asked him.  And I had to ask him three times.       
02:32:41
6  There were about a hundred objections.  And I said, you know,  
02:32:44
7  If she had just smoked the brands from when Earl knew her,     
02:32:46
8  1974 on, would just those brands of cigarettes she smoked      
02:32:50
9  during that time, was that enough to substantially contribute  
02:32:54
10  to the disease? 02:32:57
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
11             He said, Yes, absolutely.                           
02:32:58
12             Why?  Because it's the repeated exposures over      
02:32:59
13  time.
14             But even Barbara Beaty talked about Philip Morris   
02:33:01
15  and R.J. Reynolds cigarettes before then.                      
02:33:04
16             Question 3 is a no-brainer.  We would submit        
02:33:06
17  Question, 1, 2, and 3 are no-brainers.  She was addicted.      
02:33:09
18  The addiction caused the disease.  And smoking their           
02:33:12
19  cigarettes -- it was smoking these defendants' cigarettes      
02:33:16
20  that created the diseases.                                     
02:33:20
21             Now, once that happens, a very important thing      
02:33:22
22  happened. 02:33:24
23             Turn to Page 12 of the jury instructions.  11.      
02:33:24
24  I'm sorry.  Page 11 of the jury instructions.                  
02:33:28
25             Well, I'm sorry, after you answered Question 1 and  
02:33:31 193
1  2, was she addicted and addiction caused the disease, these    
02:33:34
2  findings, the Engle findings, apply.  So before you answer     
02:33:37
3  Question 3, these findings apply.                              
02:33:40
4             Smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer including     
02:33:43
5  adenocarcinoma.  That nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.     
02:33:45
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
6  It goes on. 02:33:49
7             But the next topic I want to talk about is that     
02:33:50
8  the Engle defendants concealed or omitted material             
02:33:52
9  information not otherwise known or available.  I highlight     
02:33:56
10  that.  Not otherwise known or available.  Knowing that the     
02:34:00
11  material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a       
02:34:02
12  material fact concerning the health effects or addictive       
02:34:06
13  nature of smoking cigarettes or both.                          
02:34:08
14             The next finding says that they agreed to conceal.  
02:34:10
15  These are findings that had been made.  The Judge will         
02:34:13
16  instruct you you cannot question them.  You have to accept     
02:34:16
17  them.  And after you've answered the first two questions in    
02:34:18
18  the affirmative, they apply.                                   
02:34:22
19             So any other decision you make, you need to go      
02:34:23
20  back and read these findings and say, we have to accept        
02:34:25
21  these.  These are the law.  This is what it is.                
02:34:28
22             Now, we would submit -- let's go to the timeline.   
02:34:31
23  This is when you go to the timeline.  You're on the next       
02:34:36
24  group now.  Concealment and conspiracy.                        
02:34:39
25             And we built this timeline here for you to see.     
02:34:41 194
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
1  We didn't have all the 60 million pages of documents that      
02:34:44
2  Dr. Cummings talked about.  We couldn't show you all of them.  
02:34:48
3  We had time limits in this case.                               
02:34:51
4             But he said, many times, there is a lot of          
02:34:53
5  examples of this type of document or that type of document.    
02:34:55
6  There are tons of these documents.  We could only show you a   
02:34:57
7  few.  02:35:00
8             But the conspiracy started back here at the Plaza   
02:35:01
9  Hotel where they agreed to create these entities, the Tobacco  
02:35:05
10  Industry Research Committee and the TIRC, to lie about         
02:35:10
11  whether cigarettes cause cancer.  Oh, it's not true.  The      
02:35:11
12  science isn't there.  You heard from the Philip Morris         
02:35:17
13  executive from the last video.  Science isn't there.  It's     
02:35:19
14  not true.  It went on all the way to when Faye Graham died.    
02:35:22
15             And you can see these exhibits, you know,           
02:35:26
16  Exhibit 166.  In 1961, the cigarette scientists -- this is     
02:35:29
17  the document that they say there is these carcinogens and we   
02:35:34
18  can't remove them.  We can't get them out.                     
02:35:38
19             You heard Dr. Gentry and Dr. Jupe say we are        
02:35:41
20  trying -- it's not addiction.  It's the carcinogens in the     
02:35:43
21  cigarette we are trying to get rid of.  But they knew back     
02:35:47
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
22  then they can't remove them.  It's impossible.  Dr. Jupe said  
02:35:50
23  it's impossible.  They knew it in 1961.  But what they won't   
02:35:54
24  work on is addiction.  02:35:58
25             You go on.  They started selling doubt as our       
02:35:59 195
1  product.  They said it in their own internal documents, and    
02:36:03
2  they continue. 02:36:06
3             Now, what did they do about making their product    
02:36:06
4  addictive?  First, they lied about whether it causes disease   
02:36:10
5  and is injurious.  What do they do about making their product  
02:36:13
6  addictive?  All these.  Exhibit -- 1962, Exhibit 77.  We now   
02:36:16
7  possess a knowledge about how to -- about nicotine addiction   
02:36:24
8  and how it works. 02:36:27
9             And by 1982 -- I'm sorry, 1982, they have this      
02:36:29
10  document where they talk about we can improve our share of     
02:36:37
11  the market by targeting our products to the crucial entry and  
02:36:41
12  exit groups.  Exit groups, addicted people trying to quit.     
02:36:45
13  Nicorette gum coming out.  These are the exit groups they are  
02:36:49
14  worried about.  This is Exhibit 72.  We would submit that's a  
02:36:53
15  document worth reading.  02:36:56
16             And then finally, Exhibit 210, in 1984, because     
02:36:58
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
17  you are going to be asked this question in the concealment     
02:37:03
18  conspiracy claims:  Did she rely on things that happened       
02:37:06
19  after 1982?  Of course she did.  The whole conspiracy started  
02:37:09
20  way back here and continued way past 1982.                     
02:37:14
21             In 1984 -- can we bring up that document?           
02:37:17
22             In 1984 -- okay.  If you can bring that up a        
02:37:36
23  little bit bigger. 02:37:40
24             This document is a study that's being done          
02:37:41
25  internally in the cigarette industry, confidential, not out    
02:37:47 196
1  there, where they are discussing all the ways they can         
02:37:52
2  manipulate and control the design of the cigarette.  Control   
02:37:56
3  the nicotine delivery to keep people addicted.                 
02:37:59
4             And by the time you get to '84, they are laughing   
02:38:02
5  at their customers.  They are laughing at their customers.     
02:38:06
6  They are poetic about it.  A cigarette is the perfect type of  
02:38:11
7  perfect pleasure.  It is exquisite and leaves one              
02:38:16
8  unsatisfied.  What more can one want.  They quote.             
02:38:20
9             And then it goes on to say, Let us provide the      
02:38:23
10  exquisiteness and hope that they, our customers, continue to   
02:38:27
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
11  remain unsatisfied. 02:38:30
12             Well, they know they will because many of them are  
02:38:33
13  addicted. 02:38:36
14             All we would want then is a larger bag to carry     
02:38:37
15  the money to the bank. 02:38:41
16             Okay.  At the same time, 400,000 body bags --       
02:38:42
17             MS. PARKER:  Objection.  Argument.                  
02:38:49
18             THE COURT:  Overruled.                              
02:38:52
19             MR. GEARY:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  Additional      
02:38:54
20  objection as to the Williams objection we talked about         
02:38:55
21  before.  02:38:59
22             THE COURT:  Overruled.                              
02:38:59
23             MR. BYRD:  Dr. Gentry admitted 400,000 deaths a     
02:39:02
24  year.  One in two smokers are going to get a disease.  It was  
02:39:06
25  a little bit vague in his mind, and then he remembered         
02:39:09 197
1  400,000 deaths a year. 02:39:12
2             Faye Graham was one of them.                        
02:39:15
3             Now, you are going to get to a question, question   
02:39:16
4  number -- let me go to the comparative fault question.         
02:39:19
5             So we would submit to you, have we proved more      
02:39:24
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
6  likely right than wrong that they agreed -- that they          
02:39:26
7  concealed information?  Of course we did.  Because there was   
02:39:29
8  information that was not otherwise known or available as       
02:39:33
9  given to you by the Engle findings once you find she is a      
02:39:35
10  member of the Engle class.                                     
02:39:40
11             Was it a conspiracy?  You will be instructed on     
02:39:42
12  that.  They did agree.  You will be instructed on what a       
02:39:44
13  conspiracy is. 02:39:47
14             One of the next questions --                        
02:39:48
15             MS. PARKER:  Objection as to the term that's used.  
02:39:48
16  It's an agreement. 02:39:51
17             THE COURT:  Overruled.                              
02:39:52
18             MR. BYRD:  It's a conspiracy claim we have.         
02:39:53
19  Agreement -- the jury will be instructed about what a          
02:39:57
20  conspiracy is. 02:40:00
21             Now, the next question you'll be asked about was    
02:40:00
22  whether -- was the reliance a legal cause of Faye Graham's     
02:40:06
23  death in each of these questions?  Of course it was.           
02:40:11
24             You will go to the jury instruction again where     
02:40:13
25  they tell you what is legal cause.  And legal cause doesn't    
02:40:14 198
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
1  have to be the only reason.  It has to be a reason.  The       
02:40:17
2  concealment and omissions and lies that you see on this        
02:40:21
3  timeline just had to be a reason that contributed to her       
02:40:23
4  disease and death.  And we submit that that's true.            
02:40:28
5             Now, let's get to comparative fault.                
02:40:31
6  Incidentally, Barbara Beaty came in here and she's about the   
02:40:36
7  only -- you know, only person that the defendants wanted to    
02:40:41
8  use for anything, and came in here and she said some pretty    
02:40:45
9  harsh charges about Mr. Earl Graham.  Well, he beat my mom.    
02:40:49
10             Now, let's say a couple of things about that.  She  
02:40:54
11  never said anywhere in her deposition that was all day         
02:40:57
12  long -- she had an all-day deposition.                         
02:41:00
13             MS. PARKER:  Objection, your Honor.  Not in         
02:41:02
14  evidence.  Objection.  02:41:03
15             THE COURT:  Do you mean her testimony?              
02:41:04
16             MR. BYRD:  She was asked whether -- wasn't she --   
02:41:06
17  in a deposition for how long it was, and she was asked         
02:41:10
18  whether she said anything like that.                           
02:41:13
19             MS. PARKER:  No, your Honor.  No evidence.          
02:41:15
20             THE COURT:  Well, that's overruled.  There was a    
02:41:18
21  question about her deposition.  There was not any specific     
02:41:21
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
22  reference to anything in her deposition, but you did ask her   
02:41:24
23  about her deposition testimony.                                
02:41:27
24             The jury will remember what her testimony was       
02:41:28
25  specifically. 02:41:31 199
1             MR. BYRD:  She was -- she came in here and she      
02:41:33
2  said -- Mr. Lantinberg asked her:  You gave a deposition, a    
02:41:37
3  full-day deposition; is that right?  9:00 to 5:00 or           
02:41:42
4  something like that. 02:41:44
5             Yes, I did. 02:41:45
6             And you didn't say anything about this in that      
02:41:46
7  deposition? 02:41:47
8             Well, she said, Well, I don't think I was asked.    
02:41:48
9             Okay.  A full-day deposition, I submit to you       
02:41:52
10  everything would be covered, and she had nothing to say about  
02:41:56
11  that. 02:41:59
12             But what she did do is the day before she came in   
02:41:59
13  to testify, she talked to the cigarette companies' lawyers     
02:42:02
14  and then came in here and testified.                           
02:42:06
15             Now, what did she testify about?  One incident --   
02:42:07
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
16  did she describe any circumstances about what happened?  Did   
02:42:10
17  she describe any specifics about what happened?  Any of the    
02:42:13
18  facts surrounding it?  Exactly when, where, what the           
02:42:16
19  situation was?  No.  You didn't hear that.                     
02:42:19
20             You did hear from Mr. Earl Graham, who came up and  
02:42:21
21  he acknowledged one incident they had when they first met,     
02:42:25
22  and he told the defendants about it in his deposition.  This   
02:42:28
23  is how they knew.  So Mr. Graham said nothing ever like that   
02:42:31
24  ever happened again. 02:42:35
25             And so I would submit, No. 1, it didn't happen.     
02:42:36 200
1  Nothing happened like that.  There is all sorts of reasons     
02:42:41
2  why family members come in and have disputes and --            
02:42:43
3             MS. PARKER:  Objection.  No evidence.               
02:42:48
4             MR. BYRD:  -- you did not hear --                   
02:42:50
5             THE COURT:  I'll sustain that.                      
02:42:52
6             MR. BYRD:  -- you did not hear any evidence.        
02:42:54
7  Certainly not enough evidence to say likely right than wrong   
02:42:56
8  to say what she said was true.                                 
02:42:59
9             You heard evidence from Mr. Graham, too.            
02:43:00
10             Regardless, what does it matter right now to your   
02:43:04
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
11  questions of addiction and to whether addiction caused her     
02:43:07
12  disease?  Is this a distraction?  Does this really matter to   
02:43:09
13  what you have to decide in this case?                          
02:43:12
14             Now, on the comparative fault issue, this is where  
02:43:15
15  you will be asked what percentage of fault should be           
02:43:18
16  attributed to Faye Graham and what comparative fault should    
02:43:21
17  be attributed to Reynolds and Philip Morris.                   
02:43:27
18             Here's what we would submit to the jury here.       
02:43:30
19  This is the place where if you have a problem with whether --  
02:43:33
20  you know, how hard she tried to quit, whether she should have  
02:43:37
21  known to quit earlier, or what she should have done in         
02:43:40
22  quitting, this is the place for you to put that in.            
02:43:43
23             We would submit to you that the first warnings      
02:43:46
24  weren't until 1966.  She started smoking in 1951.  For 15      
02:43:49
25  years there were no warnings on packages.  Okay.  For the      
02:43:54 201
1  rest of the years, there was a warning that said it may be     
02:43:58
2  hazardous.  The Surgeon General says it may be hazardous.      
02:44:01
3             It wasn't until 1985 when the Surgeon General -- I  
02:44:04
4  mean, when the Surgeon General demanded that a warning be on   
02:44:07
5  that said it causes lung cancer.  It was the first time.       
02:44:09
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
6             So for seven or eight years, eight years of her     
02:44:12
7  smoking history, from '85 to 1993 when she died, that warning  
02:44:15
8  was on the package. 02:44:20
9             MR. GEARY:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  Objection,      
02:44:21
10  preemption. 02:44:22
11             THE COURT:  Overruled.                              
02:44:23
12             MR. BYRD:  That's 20 percent of her smoking         
02:44:25
13  history. 02:44:28
14             What we would argue is that, look, they made the    
02:44:28
15  cigarettes.  She smoked them.  We would start at 50/50 for     
02:44:31
16  everybody. 02:44:35
17             But if you take -- you know, take the 20 percent    
02:44:36
18  history that she had that knowledge of between 1958 and 1992   
02:44:39
19  about lung cancer, take that 20 percent and split it 50/50.    
02:44:44
20  Why?  Because of what they were doing.  They didn't even       
02:44:49
21  admit it until 1999 that it caused cancer.                     
02:44:53
22             If you split it two ways, that's 10 percent fault   
02:44:57
23  to Mrs. Graham.  She has paid with her life already.  That's   
02:45:00
24  10 percent fault to Mrs. Graham and 90 percent fault to        
02:45:04
25  R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris.  And we would submit          
02:45:10 202
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
1  equally. 02:45:13
2             Now, I will be back up here when I can, but I need  
02:45:14
3  to talk to you about -- well, as you consider that             
02:45:17
4  comparative fault, I want you to remember, you know, the       
02:45:20
5  cigarette companies had a hundred percent of the knowledge of  
02:45:25
6  what they were doing with their cigarettes in designing the    
02:45:28
7  product, and they worked as hard as they could to push her     
02:45:31
8  knowledge down to zero with what she had.                      
02:45:36
9             They did everything they could with their           
02:45:38
10  advertising.  They spent -- all the pink sheets in the world   
02:45:40
11  that the defendants put on this board, all the pink sheets in  
02:45:44
12  the world, okay -- we read you the FTC report.  The cigarette  
02:45:49
13  companies spent in one day what the public health authorities  
02:45:55
14  spent in a year to warn people.  Now, think about that.        
02:45:58
15             All the pink sheets in the world can't undo that.   
02:46:03
16  And there is a reason why they are sending this advertising    
02:46:07
17  out while these claims are coming out in newspapers.  They     
02:46:10
18  are bombarding a hundred times.  If we had played the          
02:46:13
19  advertisements here comparable to the PSAs that were out       
02:46:16
20  there, we would have been here for weeks.  A hundred times     
02:46:22
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
21  the number of ads for one PSA.                                 
02:46:25
22             So think about that.  They had a hundred percent    
02:46:28
23  of the knowledge and worked so hard through advertising and    
02:46:30
24  other ways to push our knowledge down to zero.                 
02:46:33
25             Now, how do you judge the damages in this case?     
02:46:36 203
1  You will get to the spot in the verdict form where you were    
02:46:40
2  asked to state the total amount of damages you find for Earl   
02:46:48
3  Graham's loss of support.  And the Judge will instruct you     
02:46:51
4  about how you are supposed to determine that.                  
02:46:54
5             You are just supposed to look at the losses to      
02:46:56
6  be -- the full, just, and reasonable compensation.  And we     
02:47:01
7  are not asking you for sympathy.  We are not asking you --     
02:47:05
8  the time for sympathy is gone.  We want you to talk about      
02:47:08
9  just the losses that he suffered.                              
02:47:11
10             Here's a man, okay, who, by the way, should not     
02:47:13
11  be -- no one wants to be judged -- even if it is -- even if    
02:47:17
12  there is any remote truthfulness to anything that Ms. Beaty    
02:47:21
13  said, and there is not.  02:47:24
14             No one wants to be judged by the worst day in       
02:47:26
15  their life.  He had 20-some-odd years -- or about 20 years,    
02:47:28
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
16  from '74 to '93, with Faye Graham.  Love at first sight, and   
02:47:34
17  went on.  And she was independent herself.  She loved Earl     
02:47:38
18  Graham.  They did things together.  They drove an RV.  They    
02:47:44
19  traveled around together.                                      
02:47:49
20             It was one of the last things they were able to     
02:47:50
21  do.  She just wanted to get in the car and drive around with   
02:47:52
22  him.  It was as if they were married since 1974.  He had the   
02:47:55
23  watch that you saw.  He had the rings that she gave him in     
02:47:58
24  1974, and he's never taken them off.  Never remarried and      
02:48:02
25  never taken them off.  She did everything for him.             
02:48:05 204
1             She did one of the things that's probably the most  
02:48:07
2  embarrassing and hardest things to discuss with people you     
02:48:09
3  don't know.  He couldn't read.  She read for him since they    
02:48:12
4  knew each other.  She did all of the stuff to deal around the  
02:48:16
5  house, even as much as reading his entire life.  Now he goes   
02:48:19
6  down the street to a friend with his mail.                     
02:48:23
7             So, you know, if I were here asking you for -- if   
02:48:25
8  I were here asking you to compensate Mr. Graham because he     
02:48:29
9  loss somebody he loved for a week, maybe that would be         
02:48:32
10  something that I would ask in the thousands for.               
02:48:34
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
11             If I were here asking you to -- you know,           
02:48:36
12  Mr. Graham lost somebody for a few months because she is in    
02:48:40
13  the hospital and this is a tough recovery period, you know,    
02:48:43
14  maybe we would get in the tens of thousands.  But you have to  
02:48:45
15  measure the level of harm here that was suffered.              
02:48:49
16             Here we have somebody who lost, as you heard        
02:48:52
17  Mr. Lantinberg read the tables and that's why we did that,     
02:48:55
18  lost somebody who had a life expectancy of 25 years.  She had  
02:48:59
19  another 25 years to live.  She died in 1993.  She would still  
02:49:03
20  be here with us today.  How do you measure that?  You have to  
02:49:09
21  do that.  You have to measure that.                            
02:49:12
22             But that's why we suggest a number of $6 million.   
02:49:15
23  5.5 million puffs, that's about a dollar a puff.  $6 million.  
02:49:20
24             You may choose to do more than that.  You may       
02:49:26
25  choose to do a little bit less than that.  That's in your      
02:49:29 205
1  hands, but we suggest to you that that's the number.           
02:49:32
2             And then the final question that you are going to   
02:49:34
3  be asked is about punitive damages.                            
02:49:38
4             The punitive damage question is whether their       
02:49:40
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
5  conduct -- it's very simple.  The Judge is going to instruct   
02:49:46
6  you.  02:49:49
7             The standard is if you find that Mr. Graham has     
02:49:51
8  proved by clear and convincing evidence -- it's a higher       
02:49:59
9  standard than beyond more likely right than wrong.  It is a    
02:50:02
10  little bit higher standard.  Everything else is on the more    
02:50:05
11  likely right than wrong. 02:50:08
12             We have to show you by clear and convincing         
02:50:10
13  evidence that the defendant had -- the defendants had actual   
02:50:11
14  knowledge of the wrongfulness of their conduct and that there  
02:50:15
15  was a high probability of injury or damage to Mrs. Graham,     
02:50:17
16  and despite that knowledge, intentionally pursued that course  
02:50:20
17  of conduct resulting in Mrs. Graham's death.                   
02:50:23
18             All we ask you to do is see this timeline.  By the  
02:50:26
19  way, this is not evidence.  This is not going to go back in    
02:50:32
20  the jury room with you.  It's here right now for you to see.   
02:50:34
21             All we would submit to you, of course, this was     
02:50:37
22  intentional.  They were designing the products intentionally   
02:50:39
23  for addiction. 02:50:42
24             By the time you get to 1984, they are laughing      
02:50:43
25  about it.  All we need is a bigger bag to go to the bank.      
02:50:46 206
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
1             And today, Dr. Gentry and Dr. Jupe, you know, they  
02:50:50
2  can't even admit addiction causes the disease.  They can't     
02:50:57
3  even admit addiction causes the disease.  Oh, it's addictive,  
02:51:01
4  and we admit smoking causes cancer and that smoking can be     
02:51:05
5  addictive. 02:51:08
6             But you heard the attorney ask him, What about      
02:51:09
7  chain of causation?  Doesn't addiction, then, cause the        
02:51:12
8  disease? 02:51:15
9             No, no, no, we wouldn't say that.  We can't say     
02:51:15
10  that. 02:51:18
11             And that's their current dispute.  That's what      
02:51:19
12  they dispute now, because what they will say is anybody can    
02:51:22
13  quit. 02:51:25
14             Now I'm going to sit down.  I thank you for your    
02:51:25
15  time.  I will only have a few minutes to come back.  I took    
02:51:27
16  more than I expected.  I am only going to have a few minutes   
02:51:30
17  when I get back up here. 02:51:33
18             But you'll hear from the attorneys on the other     
02:51:34
19  side, and they are very good attorneys, and you will hear      
02:51:36
20  from them.  And I will just ask a couple of things when you    
02:51:39
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
21  listen.  02:51:42
22             One, remember this campaign of doubt, okay?         
02:51:42
23  Remember they are going to come up here with arguments and     
02:51:47
24  say, Oh, we don't know if it was lung cancer.  Maybe it was    
02:51:50
25  this. 02:51:52 207
1             MS. PARKER:  Objection, your Honor.  We have a      
02:51:53
2  right to defend ourselves.                                     
02:51:54
3             THE COURT:  I'll overrule that.                     
02:51:56
4             MR. BYRD:  We don't know if this is lung cancer.    
02:51:59
5  We don't really know if she ever -- we don't know if she ever  
02:52:01
6  really saw any of our advertising.                             
02:52:05
7             What is more likely right than wrong is what you    
02:52:07
8  have to look at.  And I want you to think about that as you    
02:52:09
9  hear their arguments.  02:52:12
10             Every time -- she is going -- I believe they will   
02:52:13
11  talk to you about Faye Graham's choices that she made.  And    
02:52:17
12  they are going to use the word "choice" over and over.         
02:52:20
13             Every time they talk about Faye Graham's choices    
02:52:22
14  that she made, I want you to think about the exact same        
02:52:24
15  timeline of when they are talking about what choices they      
02:52:28
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
16  made.  What choices Faye did during that same time.            
02:52:31
17             Finally, as they argue, we would submit that the    
02:52:35
18  argument in this case, really, from the tobacco companies is   
02:52:42
19  this -- and I want you to think about this in a common sense   
02:52:45
20  way.  Back to common sense.  The argument from the tobacco     
02:52:49
21  companies is:  Faye Graham, what were you doing?  You were     
02:52:53
22  just dumb to buy our product and use it.  Why did you do       
02:52:59
23  that? 02:53:05
24             Think about that and where we are in this           
02:53:05
25  courtroom.  What you are going to do is important.  You are    
02:53:08 208
1  the last stop for this -- for Mr. Graham's claims.             
02:53:10
2             The President, he's one branch of government.  The  
02:53:15
3  Congress is another branch --                                  
02:53:17
4             MS. PARKER:  Objection.                             
02:53:19
5             THE COURT:  I'll sustain that.  It's not the last   
02:53:19
6  stop, necessarily. 02:53:22
7             MR. BYRD:  Okay.  Maybe appeal.                     
02:53:24
8             THE COURT:  I'm sorry?                              
02:53:26
9             MR. BYRD:  It may be appealed.                      
02:53:28
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
10             THE COURT:  You understand the objection and you    
02:53:30
11  understand the ruling because we talked about it.              
02:53:32
12             MR. BYRD:  Okay.                                    
02:53:34
13             You are the third branch of government for us.      
02:53:35
14             MS. PARKER:  Objection, your Honor.                 
02:53:40
15             THE COURT:  That's fine.  But, Mr. Byrd, you need   
02:53:42
16  to make your point and move on.                                
02:53:45
17             MR. BYRD:  Okay.                                    
02:53:47
18             And we ask that you consider the evidence           
02:53:48
19  carefully.  Read the evidence and the documents we have put    
02:53:52
20  forward and that you will take back in the jury room with      
02:53:55
21  you.  And return a verdict of -- what we would suggest is $6   
02:53:57
22  million for Mr. Graham's losses and a yes on punitive          
02:54:03
23  damages. 02:54:08
24             Thank you very much.                                


7             MR. BYRD:  So that's the argument.  She             
03:58:55
8  shouldn't -- she should have known better than to smoke the    
03:59:11
9  very products we wanted her to smoke and gave to her to        
03:59:13
10  smoke. 03:59:17
11             Now, you heard some arguments here from them        
03:59:17
12  that -- you know, you heard Ms. Parker say they want you to    
03:59:20
13  come back for more evidence.  You can just check no, no, no,   
03:59:22
14  and then you can go home.  You are better than that.           
03:59:26
15             Mr. Graham has asked for more than that.  We want   
03:59:31
16  you to look at the evidence.  Take the time you need to look   
03:59:33
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
17  at the evidence and make a decision that you want.             
03:59:37
18             They mentioned the word "quit" over and over.  The  
03:59:39
19  word "quit" is not in the verdict form.  If anything, it goes  
03:59:44
20  into the comparative fault section.  The percentage of fault.  
03:59:47
21             If their definition of "addiction" were true,       
03:59:52
22  guess what?  Then there is no addiction.  We all agree that    
03:59:57
23  people can quit.  Any addict of any drug can quit.  It         
04:00:01
24  doesn't mean that you weren't addicted.  And that's the        
04:00:05
25  question that you will face.                                   
04:00:08 255
1             I heard them mention the 60 million people that     
04:00:10
2  have quit smoking.  They didn't tell you about the definition  
04:00:14
3  of how that was determined.  You only had to have smoked a     
04:00:16
4  hundred cigarettes ever to have been a smoker.  Only a         
04:00:19
5  hundred. 04:00:22
6             They didn't talk to you about how many of those     
04:00:23
7  people relapsed.  We didn't hear about all the people that     
04:00:28
8  relapsed of the 60 million, which is what the experts say,     
04:00:30
9  chronic relapsing disease.                                     
04:00:35
10             The medical records -- let's go to the medical      
04:00:39
11  records. 04:00:42
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
12             By the way, you heard the stipulations of fact.     
04:00:44
13  There is no stipulation of fact that R.J. Reynolds is legally  
04:00:49
14  responsible for these companies you heard about, the American  
04:00:52
15  Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson.  Those are the companies  
04:00:56
16  that -- they were the previous names, but they own them now,   
04:00:58
17  and they are legally responsible for them.  There is no        
04:01:01
18  dispute about that whatsoever.  That's the law.                
04:01:04
19             Now, the medical records you talked about, they     
04:01:07
20  wrote -- in the first medical record, they wrote plus          
04:01:13
21  30-year-pack history.  They said there was nothing in the      
04:01:17
22  medical records about addiction.  What do you think they       
04:01:19
23  wrote that for?  Of course, it relates to her lung cancer.     
04:01:22
24             They only talked to you about two medical records.  
04:01:25
25  In their exhibits, there are only two records.                 
04:01:29 256
1             We gave you all the medical records, Exhibit 1365.  
04:01:31
2             Of course, they pick the first ones when they are   
04:01:35
3  first starting to test.  After they test, their doctors, her   
04:01:37
4  treating doctors, said lung cancer.  Adenocarcinoma.  You      
04:01:41
5  have Engle finding caused by smoking.  Adenocarcinoma of the   
04:01:44
6  lung, the treating doctors did say that.                       
04:01:47
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
7             Dr. Feingold is not disagreeing with them.  He      
04:01:50
8  went on to test it and prove it further.  You heard nothing    
04:01:52
9  from the defendants to counter that.                           
04:01:56
10             The last people who can blame Faye Graham for       
04:01:58
11  smoking cigarettes, surely, are the companies that gave them   
04:02:04
12  to her.  04:02:08
13             You heard Mr. Heimann say, I wouldn't blame a       
04:02:09
14  smoker for smoking one pack.  I won't blame them for smoking   
04:02:12
15  two.  But that's what they are doing to Faye Graham right      
04:02:16
16  now.  04:02:19
17             Now, you heard them talk about -- briefly about     
04:02:19
18  medical issues.  Oh, now it came from a different part of the  
04:02:22
19  body, the GI tract.  But the medical records, when you look,   
04:02:26
20  you know that -- you remember Dr. Feingold said if it had

04:02:36
23  the liver was all clear. 04:02:39
24             Read the medical records.  The liver was all        
04:02:41
25  clear.  And that's why they were able to test and the

1  treating doctors said adenocarcinoma of the lung and that's    
04:02:45

04:02:49
3             Seal the deal a hundred percent, TTF-1, napsin A,   
04:02:52
4  no question.  04:02:57
5             Now, you heard the defendants talk about these      
04:02:59
6  documents that we brought up.  Oh, just a few documents.       
04:03:01
7  Well, we didn't have time to bring you all of them.  Of        
04:03:04
8  course not.  And that would be wasting some time if we sat     
04:03:07
9  here forever. 04:03:11
10             No witness from R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris      
04:03:11
11  came in here to tell you any different than what we showed     
04:03:15
12  you in those documents are what they meant.  They brought no   
04:03:17
13  witness.  And if there was a good explanation, they would      
04:03:21
14  have brought it.  04:03:24
15             They read some documents, cherry picked things      
04:03:25
16  from the stuff they wrote and gave to people to mislead them.  
04:03:27
17  There is -- speaking of which, there is no evidence in here    
04:03:31
18  at all about why they talk about the E.U. made this decision   
04:03:33
19  about light and low tars.  We have heard no evidence about     
04:03:37
20  what the circumstances were or what information they had, if   
04:03:40
21  they even made that decision.                                  
04:03:43
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
22             Now, you heard no evidence at all from the          
04:03:44
23  defendants to contradict the videos you heard from their own   
04:03:49
24  executives.  You know, if these pink sheets are so obvious     
04:03:53
25  that they put on there and Mrs. Graham should have known,      
04:03:58 258
1  what were the cigarette executives doing?  Closing their eyes  
04:04:04
2  and ears?  They didn't hear it?                                
04:04:07
3             Mr. Heimann and the Philip Morris executives, what  
04:04:10
4  were they doing?  Did they not read Reader's Digest?  There    
04:04:12
5  was no evidence that Faye Graham ever read Reader's Digest.    
04:04:15
6  If it was so obvious, what were they doing?  Why were they     
04:04:18
7  marketing cigarettes saying that they are so good for you and  
04:04:22
8  that they are okay for you and they won't hurt you if they     
04:04:25
9  knew all these pink sheets were true?                          
04:04:29
10             Now, it's like this, an analogy -- cell phones.     
04:04:31
11  Everybody uses cell phones today.  Okay.  And let's say        
04:04:38
12  reports come out if you use your cell phone all the time, you  
04:04:42
13  might get brain cancer.  You see it in newspapers sometimes.   
04:04:45
14  A few articles here and there.                                 
04:04:50
15             What if 30, 40 years down the road, we find out     
04:04:51
16  that lo and behold, the cell phone companies knew they had     
04:04:57
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
17  these documents that said it causes brain cancer and they hid  
04:05:03
18  them?  They didn't tell us.  They waited while everybody kept  
04:05:06
19  using it, developing this stuff, and they didn't say a word    
04:05:09
20  about it. 04:05:12
21             And then we try to hold them accountable, and they  
04:05:12
22  go back and go, Well, you knew.  You knew.  You heard it in    
04:05:15
23  newspapers it causes brain cancer.                             
04:05:20
24             And you are trying to come back and trying to say,  
04:05:22
25  Well, hold on, but everybody was using cell phones.  Nobody    
04:05:25 259
1  really believed it. 04:05:28
2             Well, it's in the newspaper right here.  Here's an  
04:05:30
3  article.  Here's an article.  Here's an article.  What were    
04:05:32
4  you doing using that cell phone?                               
04:05:34
5             It changes everything.  These documents change      
04:05:36
6  everything because now we know they knew.                      
04:05:39
7             And all these pink sheets -- repackaging.           
04:05:43
8  Repackaging.  Now, Ms. Parker says we are repacking.  Faye

04:05:54
11             THE COURT:  Two minutes, Mr. Byrd.                  
04:05:56
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
12             MR. BYRD:  From the greatest -- this is             
04:05:58
13  Exhibit 1060.  You'll have it back here.  You'll have all      
04:06:07
14  these print ads you can just flip through.                     
04:06:10
15             If they knew that this stuff was hurting people     
04:06:12
16  and killing people, what were these ads doing?  More doctors   
04:06:14
17  smoke Camels. 04:06:18
18             Look through them, please, Ed.  Keep going.         
04:06:20
19             Oh, this will help your throat.  No throat          
04:06:23
20  irritation.  What were they doing advertising this?            
04:06:25
21             Keep flipping through, Ed.  Over and over.  Keep    
04:06:29
22  flipping through, because we don't have the time to go         
04:06:33
23  through all of them. 04:06:35
24             If they knew that this stuff was bad, why were      
04:06:35
25  they doing this?  $250 billion.  They spent more in one day    
04:06:39 260
1  than the public health authorities could spend in a year to    
04:06:43
2  warn people.  04:06:46
3             You think -- I mean, the cell phone companies,      
04:06:47
4  more newspaper reports or more advertisements to buy cell      
04:06:53
5  phones?  Which one blankets?                                   
04:06:57
VOL 07 PM GRAHAM, Earl
6             Now, I appreciate your time.                        
04:06:59
7             The last thing I'll say, the defendants argue that  
04:07:02
8  there is no reliance.  There is no proof of reliance.  There   
04:07:05
9  is no communication here that she relied on.  Reliance?        
04:07:09
10  5.5 million puffs.  The communication from the cigarette       
04:07:16
11  company after 1982?  After they said the exit gates are open.  
04:07:20
12  Oh, no, December 1982, look at Exhibit 72 about this.          
04:07:25
13  Exhibit 72, read it.  It's a great document.                   
04:07:29
14             The connection?  Every time she opened one of       
04:07:34
15  these and puffed them.  Every time.  There is the              
04:07:37
16  communication.  Every time she opened one of these and puffed  
04:07:41
17  on it.  A new reliance on their product.                       
04:07:45
18             Just like when you open a bottle of water and you   
04:07:50
19  assume that what's in it is what they have told you about.     
04:07:52
20  That's the reliance.  The cigarettes that she smoked.          
04:07:55
21             THE COURT:  Time, Mr. Byrd.                         
04:08:00
22             MR. BYRD:  We appreciate your time, and we request  
04:08:01
23  a verdict in our favor for Mr. Graham, as we said.  Thank      
04:08:04
24  you.  Thank you for your time.
