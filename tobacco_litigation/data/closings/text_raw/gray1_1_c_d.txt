4                   MR. KACZYNSKI:  Thank you, Your Honor,
 5             Counsel, Mrs. Gray.
 6                   Ladies and Gentleman of the Jury, we've
 7             come a long way together.  It's been a very
 8             interesting trial, I would imagine.  I see we're
 9             finally winding down and as we do, let me sort of
10             start here where I started the first time around,
11             and that is to thank you for the attention you've
12             paid.  Thank you for your service.
13                   You know, in our country there's a scale or
14             a range of ways you can serve your country or
15             your state or your county.  It could be as simple
16             as paying your taxes, ranging all the way up to
17             the ultimate sacrifice.  You folks are on the
18             upper end of that scale with your jury service
19             because as I said before, we literally could not
20             do this without you and your willingness to 21             serve.  I'm sure I speak for everyone, we're
22             grateful for it.  Thank you.
23                   In my opening I told you that this case was
24             about Charles Gray and the choices he made.
25             Since then we've seen a lot of paper put up on

 1             the screen, a lot of witnesses in the witness
 2             chair.  You've heard from M.D.s, and Ph.D.s, a
 3             psychiatrist, Mr. Gray's family and friends,
 4             either live or by deposition.  But even after all
 5             that, this case is still about Charles Gray and
 6             the choices he made, the choice to smoke, the
 7             choice to continue to smoke, and ultimately the
 8             choice to accept personal responsibility for his
 9             actions.
10                   In this case as you are the finders of
11             fact, it's up to you and only you to look at the
12             testimony, to look at the witnesses; and in this
13             case you've actually had a witness who came out
14             and said he was rooting for the plaintiffs to
15             win.
16                   You can employ your God-given common sense
17             to the testimony of the witnesses that you've
18             heard to decide that first question you were
19             shown a moment ago, and that is whether Mr.
20             Gray's death was caused by an addiction to
21             cigarettes containing nicotine or whether Mr.
22             Gray's death was on account of the choices he
23             made.
24                   You're also going to have to decide whether
25             the plaintiffs built that bridge I talked about

 1             in opening, that bridge between Mr. Gray and R.J.
 2             Reynolds.  You see out here going over the bay,
 3             the bridge over the bay is built with concrete
 4             and steel.  The bridges in this courtroom have to
 5             be built with evidence and proof.  Evidence and
 6             proof that Charles Gray relied upon something
 7             that R.J. Reynolds did.  Evidence and proof, not
 8             guesswork, not to use Dr. Cummings' word of
 9             wallpaper.  Evidence and proof.
10                   Now, what is the evidence and proof?  Well,
11             you can't look at the evidence and proof until
12             you look where it came from.  And on the subject
13             of addiction, the first issue you're going to
14             have to deal with, the plaintiffs called three
15             doctors, Dr. Cummings, Dr. Burns and
16             Dr. Benowitz.
17                   Let me just start out by saying that in
18             their respective fields and what they do when
19             they deal with patients, these men have all made
20             great contributions to society.
21                   Dr. Benowitz, he's a cardiologist, and he's
22             done a lot of nicotine research, particularly in
23             heart-related issues.  Dr. Burns, an author or
24             coauthor or editor of several Surgeon General
25             reports, a pulmonologist or lung doctor.

 1             Dr. Cummings, although he's not a medical doctor
 2             or a psychiatrist or a psychologist or board
 3             certified in anything, to the extent the clinic
 4             he runs helps people quit smoking, he's
 5             performing a valuable service. 6                   But when they step away from their
 7             professions and they step into a courtroom, as
 8             they have many, many, many times, when they
 9             decide to help lawyers rather than people, they
10             become the plaintiff's dream team.
11                   You don't see a team like this very often.
12             Look at the number of trials, smoking and health
13             trials, not trials overall, 20, 20, 40.  70
14             depositions, over 100.  Lectured to lawyers,
15             recruit other witnesses, and there's their
16             billing rate.
17                   This is not the portrait of a dispassionate
18             group of experts who come in here to share their
19             expertise.  You heard from each of them, they
20             help the plaintiffs formulate their case, pick
21             the evidence, rehearse their case before mock
22             jurors and recruit others to the cause.
23                   And Dr. Cummings called it a cause.
24             Dr. Cummings called it the war against
25             cigarettes.  Dr. Cummings compared it to the war

 1             against terrorism, and he accepted the title of
 2             general in that war.  These are the things you
 3             consider when you weigh the testimony they gave
 4             you.
 5                   Now, what did they tell you?  Dr. Benowitz
 6             didn't say anything about Mr. Gray.  Dr. Cummings
 7             called Mr. Gray highly addictive.  Dr. Keefe, who
 8             is the only psychiatrist you heard from, the only
 9             person who is trained specifically in evaluating
10             people for their mental condition, he said
11             there's no such term known to medical science,
12             there's no medical meaning.
13                   Dr. Cummings took it a step further.  He
14             said he could reach that conclusion that Mr. Gray
15             was highly addictive on the basis of one
16             question.  When did he have his first cigarette
17             in the morning?  Does that sound like science to
18             you?
19                   Dr. Burns looked at more factors than that
20             and he came out and called Mr. Gray powerfully
21             addicted.  You also heard from Dr. Keefe that
22             that's another term with no medical significance
23             whatsoever.
24                   And Dr. Burns reviewed only five
25             depositions -- only five of the 15 witnesses who

 1             had been deposed in this case.  He missed some of
 2             Mr. Gray's siblings.  He missed some of Mr.
 3             Gray's children, and he missed some of Mr. Gray's
 4             close friends.
 5                   Even for this team, what was their bottom
 6             line?  Dr. Benowitz said heavy smokers can quit.
 7             Dr. Benowitz said, would you agree there's
 8             nothing about cigarettes that causes a smoker to
 9             lose the ability to be responsible for their own
10             action; that's correct, isn't it?  Answer, yes.
11                   Dr. Benowitz says that the nicotine
12             receptors in the brain are not permanent unlike
13             what Dr. Cummings said.  As far as we know they
14             go back to normal within a few weeks.  So after a
15             smoker quits smoking, the nicotine receptors do
16             come back to normal within two full weeks, right? 17             Yes.
18                   Dr. Burns, he says it's possible to quit
19             smoking, even for someone, as he said, who was
20             powerfully addicted.  He doesn't imply that it's
21             impossible to stop.  And like Dr. Benowitz,
22             Dr. Burns says, just because someone is addicted
23             to nicotine doesn't relieve that person of
24             responsibility for their own behavior.  Even an
25             addicted behavior, they have to decide to try to

 1             quit and then make a decision to quit.  They have
 2             to make an effort to quit.  Smokers are
 3             responsible for their choices.
 4                   Even Dr. Cummings, the anchor of the
 5             plaintiff's case, he says -- even he says that
 6             that's right, it was not impossible for Mr. Gray
 7             to quit at any point in his life.
 8                   Dr. Burns told you about the benefits of
 9             quitting smoking and it's a long quote that
10             basically says, it has immediate benefits for
11             people of all ages and a person who quits smoking
12             before the age of 50 would have half the risk of
13             dying in 15 years as compared to continuing
14             smokers.  The risk goes down and goes down
15             dramatically.
16                   But the best evidence we had of quitting
17             smoking was a gentleman who sat in that chair
18             about a week ago, John Gray, Mr. Gray's older
19             brother.  He told you the story of how he was
20             given a diagnosis that wasn't too favorable and
21             he said he quit to save his life, and he did.  He
22             did quit and he did save his life and he was here
23             to tell you that.
24                   As I said, Dr. Cummings was the key to the
25             plaintiff's case, the anchor of their case, all

 1             aspects of their case.  You got a good look at
 2             him.  He testified here for seven hours on direct
 3             examination.  I cross-examined him for over four.
 4             He admits that testifying has become like a
 5             second job to him that takes him away from his
 6             first job, the job where he helps people rather
 7             than helping lawyers.  This was his third trial
 8             in Pensacola.  He'll be back next month for his
 9             fourth, such that almost like testifying has
10             become his second job, Pensacola has become his
11             second home.
12                   He's the guy that told you in his view a
13             just verdict is a plaintiff's verdict.  In this
14             case you're rooting for Mrs. Gray to win, right?
15             Well I -- yes.
16                   Ladies and Gentlemen, you can sit on a jury
17             every week of your life for the rest of your life
18             and you'll never hear an answer like that.
19                   MR. LOEHR:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's
20             inappropriate.
21                   THE COURT:  Sustained.
22                   MR. KACZYNSKI:  Dr. Cummings, you will
23             learn, received training on how to avoid
24             answering questions.  You saw that on display
25             here.  Sixteen times I asked the Court to strike

 1             part of his answer as nonresponsive.  Sixteen 2             times the Court granted that and struck part of
 3             his answer as nonresponsive.
 4                   Dr. Cummings received training on how to
 5             create controversies.  You saw a little about
 6             that on display here too.  He created a
 7             controversy by using school children to write
 8             letters to the tobacco companies.  My client had
 9             the courtesy to respond, but not to the kids, to
10             the principal and the principal did not -- the
11             principal shared it with the school nurse.  The
12             school nurse shared it with Dr. Cummings and now
13             Dr. Cummings shares it as a trial exhibit all
14             across the country.  He created a controversy.
15             He learned well.
16                   Now, you saw the materials he uses when
17             he's counseling smokers.  When he's dealing with
18             people instead of lawyers, you see the things are
19             motivational, they're positive in nature.  They
20             warn about withdrawal and how to get over it.
21             They warn about relapses and tell you to hang in
22             there and start again.  You heard when he
23             testified in a cigarette trial ten years ago,
24             that he tells his patients, the people who come
25             into his clinic, that the success rate for truly

 1             motivated smokers is 100 percent.
 2                   On that witness stand he called it a joke.
 3             Now that he's here helping lawyers, he said
 4             people called it a joke.
 5                   He also came up with a phrase "constrained
 6             choice."  You want to talk about phrases with no
 7             medical meaning, that is a phrase that not only
 8             has no medical meaning, but has been adopted by
 9             nobody, not the Surgeon General, not the DSM,
10             nobody.  That's Dr. Cummings' own term that he
11             uses in courtrooms like this one.  You won't see
12             that term anywhere in his Smart Move booklet.
13                   Now that he's in a courtroom helping
14             lawyers instead of people, he paints a very bleak
15             picture for anyone who smokes a pack or more a
16             day of cigarettes.  You get the sense from his
17             testimony that smokers of that level almost lose
18             their freewill, that their smoking is almost
19             involuntary, that there's not a person standing
20             between addiction and disease.
21                   Remember what the Surgeon General said.
22             The Surgeon General said cigarette smoking
23             represents a category of health problems that can
24             be called personal choice behavior.  Again,
25             cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior and

 1             the individual must decide whether or not to
 2             continue that behavior.  The individual can
 3             decide whether or not to continue that behavior.
 4                   You saw some instances when Dr. Cummings
 5             tried a little hard to help the lawyers.  For
 6             example here, he talked about how one of Mr.
 7             Gray's grandsons said, well, he got rid of all
 8             the cigarettes in the house.  I showed you the
 9             transcript.  You saw no such thing.
10                   He suggested that the daughter Angela's
11             testimony said that Mr. Gray used a patch about
12             the same time of his bladder cancer diagnosis. 13             That's not just false.  That's impossible.  The
14             patch, we know, didn't come out until 1993.  The
15             bladder cancer and relapses were all in the
16             1980s.  There were other instances where he
17             talked about the patch without indicating exactly
18             when it was used.
19                   He cited one grandson to say he lighted one
20             cigarette after the other.  Well, in so doing, he
21             didn't tell you about the fact that his son
22             Mickey, another grandson, his sister Betty said
23             they never saw that happen.  He ignored the
24             testimony that Mr. Gray didn't smoke while he was
25             hunting.  He ignored the testimony of Gene Allen

 1             Jones who said when Mr. Gray would go hunting, he
 2             would be out there for a period of time, half
 3             day, hours, a half day, depending on how long a
 4             hunt would last, when he wouldn't smoke.
 5                   So what he cobbled together for his chart
 6             didn't seem to include anything to suggest that
 7             Mr. Gray could control his smoking.  But we saw
 8             there was plenty of evidence that Mr. Gray could
 9             control his smoking.
10                   He didn't smoke during short periods like
11             church and the movies.  He didn't smoke when he
12             was out hunting, as we heard, up to a half day.
13             He didn't smoke in the restaurant kitchen, didn't
14             smoke in the kitchen of his home and didn't smoke
15             in the country and western shows he went to with
16             his brother.
17                   Dr. Cummings talked about withdrawal.  More
18             restless, more at night.  He's trying to suggest
19             that Mr. Gray was getting up in the middle of the
20             night to have a cigarette.  It was on
21             cross-examination that we found out that him
22             getting up at night probably had nothing to do
23             with his cigarettes and everything to do with his
24             changing work patterns, changing from the fishing
25             job where he was up before the crack of dawn to

 1             the restaurant job where he went in in the
 2             afternoon and stayed until perhaps as late as one
 3             in the morning.  And then they opened the
 4             restaurant early for lunch and so his sleeping
 5             patterns changed again.
 6                   It was on cross-examination that
 7             Dr. Cummings told us, no, he couldn't say that
 8             the reason Mr. Gray was getting up was to smoke,
 9             but he certainly suggested it there.
10                   Now, there was one monumentally huge fact
11             that you didn't hear.  You didn't hear it from
12             Dr. Burns.  You didn't see it on any of
13             Dr. Cummings' slides.  You didn't even hear it on
14             the direct examination of Mrs. Gray, and that
15             monumentally huge fact is that we know Mr. Gray
16             could quit smoking because Mr. Gray did quit
17             smoking.
18                   We heard in the cross-examination of
19             Mrs. Gray that Mr. Gray quit smoking for around a
20             year.  That is a huge fact that neither
21             Dr. Cummings, nor Dr. Burns saw fit to share with
22             you.  If this case is supposed to be about
23             concealment, that's a huge thing to conceal from 24             the jury.
25                   Here is what Mrs. Gray said.  And at one

 1             point your husband decided he was going to try to
 2             quit smoking?  Yes.  You think he quit for about
 3             a year?  Almost a year?  Um-hum.  And when he
 4             quit, by the way, did you observe any personality
 5             changes?  Well, he chewed the gum.  No, roughly
 6             no.
 7                   So there was no withdrawal.  He quit
 8             smoking for a year with no withdrawal.  You
 9             didn't hear that either.
10                   Ladies and Gentlemen, when you go back to
11             smoking after you've quit for a year, we're not
12             talking about days or weeks here, a year.  It's
13             because you choose to.  You heard a lot of talk
14             about relapse in this courtroom.  This is a year
15             we're talking about.  When you go back to smoking
16             after a year, all the nicotine is out of your
17             blood in 72 hours.
18                   As you saw from Dr. Benowitz, whatever
19             changes there were with nicotine receptors in the
20             brain are back to normal in a couple of weeks.
21             If you have withdrawal, which apparently he
22             didn't, that's long since gone.  If you go back
23             to smoking after a year, it's because you want
24             to.  It's because you choose to.  And it doesn't
25             really matter whether he chose to because he

 1             enjoyed smoking.  It doesn't really matter if he
 2             chose to because the scare of the bladder cancer
 3             had worn off, as Dr. Keefe suggested the kind of
 4             thing he's seen in his patients.
 5                   It doesn't matter the pressure of opening a
 6             new business, opening Mesquite Charlie's.  And it
 7             really doesn't matter if it was a social aspect
 8             of smoking with your employees which was the
 9             situation when Mrs. Gray caught him.  It doesn't
10             matter what the reason is.  It was his reason.
11             It was his choice and that's a choice that you
12             really shouldn't second guess.
13                   When he went back to smoking about 1985,
14             there's been a lot of testimony from a lot of
15             people that he wanted to quit and he was trying
16             to quit.  I don't for a moment doubt the
17             sincerity of any of those people who came into
18             the courtroom or you heard by deposition.  He
19             probably convinced them of that.
20                   From everything we heard, Mr. Gray was a
21             gregarious guy, a sociable guy.  You have to look
22             behind his words to his acts.  Look at what he
23             did and look at what he didn't do.  And then
24             apply your common sense as to whether these were
25             real.

 1                   Between the time he quit in 1985 and the
 2             time he quit in 1993, the second time, what was
 3             going on in there?  Was he really trying to quit?
 4             Were these serious quit efforts?  In this you're
 5             aided by the advice that Dr. Cummings and
 6             Dr. Benowitz give the people they're dealing with
 7             who are trying to quit, when they're dealing with
 8             people rather than coming into courtrooms and 9             helping lawyers.
10                   They say to throw out your cigarettes.  Did
11             Mr. Gray?  No.  They say to throw out your
12             ashtrays.  Did Mr. Gray?  No.  They say to throw
13             out lighters.  No.  Not buy cigarettes.  No.
14             Tell others not to buy cigarettes.  No.  Change
15             your routine.  No.  Go to a smoking cessation
16             clinic.  No.  He did chew nicotine gum, but we
17             heard he was chewing that gum while he was still
18             smoking, and you heard that even Mrs. Gray
19             observed that and remarked to him, I see you
20             chewing gum and I see you smoking, I don't think
21             you're serious.  She was right.  It's common
22             sense.
23                   Now, you heard from Dr. Keefe, this is a
24             man who diagnoses people every day, who is
25             trained to do it, who teaches people to do it.

 1             He's the chief of psychiatry at Tampa General
 2             Hospital, the boss.  He teaches at USF.  He makes
 3             competency determinations.  He's asked by judges
 4             to make those determinations.  This is what he
 5             does.
 6                   Now, he's not as polished or practiced a
 7             witness as Dr. Cummings.  This is his first
 8             cigarette case, not his 20th or his 50th.  He
 9             diagnoses people like Mr. Gray.  He deals with
10             people, not a word processor.  No, he's not
11             published peer-reviewed stuff.  But he's dealt
12             with patients and he does it every day.
13                   And what he told you is something you ought
14             to think hard about.  He said addiction is not
15             like AIDS.  It's not like a germ.  It's not like
16             a virus.  It doesn't cause your death.  It's a
17             label for clusters of behaviors that are
18             determined by consulting the DSM.  But standing
19             between addiction and injury is a person, a you,
20             a me, a Mr. Gray.  A person with freewill, a
21             person with ability to make their own decisions,
22             and even in this age of victimhood, smoking is a
23             voluntary act as the Surgeon General said.
24             Personal choice behavior.  Addiction is a label
25             for that behavior.

 1                   But the responsibility for that behavior
 2             rests with the person who acts, not a little, not
 3             50 percent, not 20 percent, but totally.
 4                   The evidence in this trial more than shows
 5             that Mr. Gray was perfectly capable of exercising
 6             that freewill.  Perfectly capable of changing
 7             that behavior because he did.  And then he chose
 8             not to refrain from smoking anymore.
 9                   This was a man who knew how to accomplish
10             something when he really wanted to.  Not a little
11             bit, but totally.  In every business venture he
12             embarked on, he planned, he organized, he
13             executed and he was successful.  Trucking,
14             fishing, electronics, restaurant, planned,
15             organized, executed successfully.  And on
16             smoking, he did the same thing for a year.  He
17             planned, he organized, he executed successfully.
18                   Do you see a plan here for the time period
19             between 1985 and 1993?  Planning, execution, 20             organization or do you see half-heartedness, lack
21             of commitment and lack of that word we heard
22             bandied about a lot the last couple of weeks,
23             motivation, or is it simply a choice to continue
24             to smoke?
25                   You've got to want to quit for yourself.

 1             You've got to insert yourself between the
 2             addiction and the potential disease.  You've got
 3             to make your own decision.  You've got to make
 4             your own choices, for yourself not for somebody
 5             else.  Mrs. Gray wanted him to quit.  His son
 6             Mickey wanted him to quit.  His brother John
 7             wanted him to quit and Dr. Martin wanted him to
 8             quit.  But can you really look at this chart and
 9             conclude that in the period between '85 and '93
10             Mr. Gray wanted to quit?  That he had the same
11             commitment that he did when he did quit?  That he
12             could have honestly checked yes to the boxes in
13             Dr. Cummings' booklet?  Do I have what it takes
14             to quit smoking?
15                   If you look at the facts rather than the
16             words, common sense dictates the answer.  The
17             answer is no.  He could quit smoking.  He proved
18             it.  He did it.  But then he chose to continue to
19             smoke, not for the nicotine which was gone, not
20             because of brain receptors which were back to
21             normal, not because of withdrawal because he
22             never had anyway, not because of a relapse, but
23             because of choice, an exercise of freewill for
24             whatever reasons that were good and sufficient
25             for him.  Mr. Gray accepted responsibility for

 1             that choice to continue to smoke.
 2                   You didn't hear any evidence in this case,
 3             any testimony in this case that this was the kind
 4             of guy who would seek to blame somebody else for
 5             things that happen to him.  In fact, every word
 6             we heard suggested the opposite.  This was a
 7             stand-up guy.  This was not a person who thought
 8             themselves a victim.  This lawsuit is trying to
 9             turn him into a victim.
10                   He absolutely knew he had lung cancer and
11             he absolutely knew it was caused by his
12             cigarettes, and he absolutely knew who
13             manufactured those cigarettes, but he never sued
14             them.  I asked Mrs. Gray on the stand, he didn't
15             file a suit, he didn't talk about filing a suit.
16             This was not Mr. Gray's idea.
17                   He accepted personal responsibility for his
18             actions.  You're being asked to say he made his
19             choices, his choices were wrong and somebody else
20             should pay money for those choices.  Don't second
21             guess Charles Gray.  He made his choices and
22             those choices resulted in his injuries and death,
23             not his addiction.
24                   Had he chosen to stay off those cigarettes,
25             he would have realized the benefits that

 1             Dr. Burns talked about.  He didn't, and he didn't
 2             relapse either.  He chose to continue to smoke.
 3             He chose to accept personal responsibility.  So
 4             when you get to that first question on the 5             verdict form, I would ask you to check no.
 6                   Now, the second point I talked to you about
 7             in opening statement was the plaintiffs had to
 8             build a bridge between Mr. Gray and R.J.
 9             Reynolds, that something Reynolds did or didn't
10             do caused Mr. Gray to do something.  He had to
11             rely on some action of what Reynolds did.
12                   The question here is, did they build that
13             bridge by proof and by evidence between R.J.
14             Reynolds and Mr. Gray?  And the first point to be
15             made, I guess, is it's R.J. Reynolds that's in
16             this courtroom today.  You saw a lot of
17             documents, you saw a lot of people who work for
18             Philip Morris.  You saw a lot of documents that
19             were internal to Philip Morris.  The judge will
20             instruct you under the circumstances that you can
21             consider those documents and for what purposes.
22                   Dr. Cummings spent a lot of time talking
23             about Philip Morris and the words Philip Morris
24             used.  He used the term psychological crutch.  He
25             showed you the document on psychological crutch,

 1             but that was not a term used by Reynolds.  As we
 2             saw, it was coming from an internal Philip Morris
 3             document, and Dr. Cummings admitted it.  It was
 4             from a Philip Morris employee to a Philip Morris
 5             employee in Philip Morris files.  Those are
 6             Philip Morris words.  Not R.J. Reynolds words.
 7                   He showed you a document, and in fact, you
 8             saw it with Mr. Loehr in his closing, about the
 9             best program for CTR.  Once again, a memo from a
10             Philip Morris employee to a Philip Morris
11             employee with a copy to a Philip Morris employee,
12             a document only found in Philip Morris files.
13             Not Reynolds words.
14                   The mere fact that one of these authors may
15             have also held a job in the Tobacco Institute or
16             the Tobacco Institute Research Committee, that
17             doesn't turn Philip Morris files into Reynolds
18             files or Philip Morris words into Reynolds words.
19                   MR. LOEHR:  Your Honor, I object.  That's
20             contrary to the jury instruction in this case.
21                   THE COURT:  Sustained.
22                   MR. KACZYNSKI:  You saw some TV footage of
23             Mr. Bowling, a Philip Morris executive, on a
24             documentary about Philip Morris business.  You'll
25             be instructed the circumstances in which you can

 1             consider this, but just bear in mind those were
 2             not Reynolds people.
 3                   So focusing on Reynolds.  How do they try
 4             to build that bridge?  Two ways.  Advertising and
 5             what Dr. Cummings called the 50 year cover-up.
 6             We're going to take a look at both and oddly
 7             enough Dr. Cummings is right there in the middle
 8             of both.
 9                   When he switched to advertising, he took
10             off his addiction counselor cap and put on his
11             marketing and advertising cap.  Of course, he did
12             this without ever having a degree in marketing or
13             advertising, without having marketed anything
14             apart from advertising for the New York State
15             quit line.  And what did he do?  Well, he showed 16             you a lot of pictures, some ads.  He said that
17             cigarette ads during World War II had military
18             themes, just like other products.
19                   He showed you they used celebrities, just
20             like other products.  Around Christmas they used
21             Santa Claus, just like other products.  In fact,
22             you saw some in that Life magazine article from
23             the issue in 1953 that came out just before
24             Christmas.  That proves nothing.
25                   They showed you some pictures of ads from

 1             doctors in the 1950s, but what he didn't tell you
 2             about is what the Surgeon General's report in
 3             1994 said about those ads.  "With greater public
 4             concern about cancer, however, these continuing
 5             health claims, although intended to reassure
 6             consumers, were very likely increasing consumer
 7             awareness of the suspected risks of smoking."
 8             They said articles of Fortune was so riddled with
 9             warnings, it appeals to fear that the cigarette
10             industry could think that it was an inside job.
11             Those ads scared people.  Those ads reminded
12             people of the smoking and health issue.
13                   He showed you the Flintstones, but he
14             didn't tell you until cross-examination that it
15             was supposed to be an adult comedy like The
16             Family Guy today.  He didn't tell you it was on
17             at night rather than on a Saturday morning and he
18             didn't tell you it ran in 1960 when Mr. Gray was
19             already 25 years old.
20                   What does that have to do with Mr. Gray?
21             Nothing.
22                   He showed you two R.J. Reynolds memos a
23             research and development scientist wrote to
24             marketing people.  One was from Claude Teague.
25             One was from Frank Colby.  But he had to admit

 1             that in neither case did anything happen.  You
 2             can find no evidence that this was followed up on
 3             in any way?  No.  Unless you buy the idea that
 4             was suggested yesterday that Reynolds sat on this
 5             idea for 30 years when they came out with Camel
 6             Crush, unless you buy that, nothing happened and
 7             it proves nothing.
 8                   He showed you some demographic information
 9             from the National Opinion Organization.  Then he
10             had to admit it was collected for the company,
11             not specifically for the marketing department.
12             He admitted the company couldn't need information
13             like that for all variety of purposes other than
14             marketing, like knowing -- like for forecasting
15             purposes, like to know how much tobacco to buy,
16             what types of tobacco to buy, what types of
17             menthol or other flavorants to buy.  Having that
18             survey information proves nothing.
19                   The fundamental point that he was trying to
20             make was that you've got to get a cigarette
21             smoker young because they're so brand loyal that
22             if you don't get them when they're young, you're
23             not going to get them at all.  But the very
24             document that he was using undermined that
25             proposition.
3088 1                   Now, if you remember, he used only selected
 2             pages from one particular Reynolds document.
 3             When I crossed him, I used the whole thing.  And
 4             in the whole thing, not the portion he had, it
 5             talks about loyalty rates from the 1993 SDS
 6             percentage of smokers who smoke Marlboro at age
 7             18 still do.  It shows that Marlboro loses about
 8             28 percent of its 18 years olds by age 20, and
 9             another 14 percent by age 24.  A total loss of
10             42 percent over that six-year period.  They lose
11             almost half their smokers.  That's not brand
12             loyalty.
13                   So there's plenty of switching going on
14             here.  At the end of the day all this marketing
15             stuff comes back to the question I asked you to
16             ask yourself right in the beginning.  What does
17             any of that stuff have to do with Charles Gray?
18             And the answer is nothing.
19                   To claim he was exposed to an ad, the
20             wallpaper theory you heard from Dr. Cummings, is
21             not to say he relied on it or he chose to smoke
22             or not to smoke based on it.  There were no ads
23             for the roll your owns that he started smoking
24             with his brother and their friends.  If you want
25             to blame somebody for him starting smoking, blame

 1             the Hayes boys.  They're the ones that John Gray
 2             said gave them the roll your own materials back
 3             when they were young.
 4                   And there is no testimony whatsoever, no
 5             testimony whatsoever about why after that he
 6             chose the brands he chose.  None.
 7                   In fact, the only testimony about Mr. Gray
 8             and advertising is that he wasn't likely to be
 9             influenced by it.  This is from his former
10             son-in-law who knew him very well.  He was smart.
11             There were a lot of ads out there and Mr. Gray
12             probably saw some.  So what?  So what?  They
13             needed to prove reliance and they didn't.  They
14             needed proof and they didn't have it.  And
15             Dr. Cummings' wallpaper theory won't make up for
16             that.
17                   So did advertising have anything to do with
18             Charles Gray?  It did not.  It's one of those
19             bridges to nowhere.
20                   Last we come to the so-called 50 year
21             cover-up that Dr. Cummings talked about and, of
22             course, Dr. Cummings was the heart of this
23             testimony too.  The first question we should ask
24             him, exactly what it is that was covered up, and
25             he says it was what was known about the health

 1             risks of smoking and the addictive nature of
 2             cigarettes.  Those are the primary things that
 3             were covered up.
 4                   The question you have to ask yourself is
 5             whether there was something that Reynolds knew
 6             that Mr. Gray didn't or couldn't that would have
 7             made a difference to him.  And common sense is
 8             going to be the simplest answer to this question.
 9                   You heard testimony that every time
10             Mrs. Gray talked to Mr. Gray about his smoking or
11             telling him that he ought to quit, did he ever 12             argue with her?  Did he ever say, no, the Tobacco
13             Industry Research Committee says it's okay; no,
14             the Tobacco Institute says it's okay; no, R.J.
15             Reynolds says it's okay.
16                   Take a look at the first one.  When you
17             told him he should quit smoking, he never argued
18             with you saying smoking was harmless or smoking
19             was safe?  No.  He never told you he heard
20             something from, say, the Tobacco Institute that
21             said smoking was safe, right?  No.
22                   Then there's a question, the next one.
23             Mrs. Gray remembered when the Surgeon General's
24             report came out in 1964 and she remembers when
25             the warning labels came out.  And she pointed out

 1             the warning labels to her husband.  You remember
 2             calling your husband's attention to the warning
 3             labels on cigarette packs?  Yes.  And he didn't
 4             argue and say this is meaningless or anything
 5             like that, did he?  I don't remember any response
 6             he made.
 7                   Now, if he had reacted as his brother John
 8             did that this is a lot of bull, don't you think
 9             you would have heard about it?
10                   Finally, and this is the best one.  While
11             you were on the road, you suspected he was
12             smoking, he was driving all hours of the day and
13             night.  It's boring out on the road, he might
14             have been smoking, right?  Yes.  And at some
15             point you said to him, I don't think you ought to
16             be smoking, right?  I probably did, yes.  And his
17             response was, I know.  I know.  He didn't argue
18             because he knew.
19                   And then when you had the instance with his
20             son Mickey, what about addiction with his son
21             Mickey.  This, again, is the best evidence of
22             all.  His son Mickey was caught with candy
23             cigarettes.  He told Mickey not to smoke.  He
24             told him that if he did smoke, he wouldn't be
25             able to stop, and he must have made a strong

 1             impression because Mickey never became a smoker.
 2                   Now, shouldn't that be the end of the
 3             inquiry?  I mean, doesn't this prove they have
 4             not built that bridge?  The evidence was
 5             undisputed that Mr. Gray was intelligent, that he
 6             read the newspaper, that he watched the evening
 7             news, and he never argued with Mrs. Gray about
 8             his smoking because he was aware of the risks of
 9             smoking.
10                   He took those candy cigarettes away from
11             his son saying if you start, it would be tough to
12             stop.  He may not have understood the term
13             addiction, but he certainly understood the
14             concept way back in 1963.
15                   This is the only proof in the case, not
16             Dr. Cummings' wallpaper.  There is no evidence,
17             and Dr. Cummings admitted he doesn't have any
18             either, that Mr. Gray relied on anything that the
19             cigarette industry did.  There is none.  No
20             direct evidence.
21                   But we have this evidence that when
22             confronted with his behavior, he did not assert 23             as a defense, well, I know, regardless of the
24             source, he did not say, well, I know this isn't
25             harmful, I don't believe this is harmful.  He

 1             said, I know.
 2                   This is the only evidence in the case on
 3             this issue, and I would suggest that this is the
 4             evidence you should rest your verdict on on this
 5             issue.  There is no evidence that Mr. Gray relied
 6             on anything that anybody in the cigarette
 7             industry said.  He told his wife he knew.  They
 8             haven't built that bridge.
 9                   Okay.  So what was covered up?  Let's take
10             a look at the health risks of smoking.  Let's
11             start by seeing what was known and this is going
12             to be kind of a lightning round through the '30s,
13             '40s, '50s and '60s.  Next one, Time magazine
14             coffin nails in 1938.  Smoking associated with
15             longevity.  Reader's Digest articles throughout
16             the '30s and '40s.
17                   Next, chain smoker for years.  Coffin nail.
18             Reader's Digest, 1954.  Reader's Digest on
19             smoking and health throughout the 1950s.  Smoking
20             and cancer in Time magazine from 1952 to 1959.
21             Next, Pensacola Journal coverage of the lung
22             cancer studies in 1954 and 1957.
23                   Next, Reader's Digest kicked off the 1950s
24             with this article.  January 1950, How Harmful are
25             Cigarettes?  Was anybody paying attention to this

 1             stuff?  They reran the article, saying the
 2             subject of this article in January aroused more
 3             discussion and approval than any recent magazine
 4             feature.
 5                   Next, smoking and cancer in Time in 1953,
 6             epidemiological studies.  Beyond any doubt, skin
 7             painting in 1953 in Time magazine.  In Life
 8             magazine.  You saw the actual magazine.  Of
 9             course, broadcast into people's living rooms on
10             See It Now.
11                   Next, Hammond and Horn, the 1954 studies in
12             magazines.  In the Columbus Ledger, Columbus
13             being the area where Mr. Gray grew up and the
14             paper they took.  Were people paying attention?
15             George Gallup says yes.
16                   George Gallup, as you heard from the
17             polling expert, Dr. Geer, they wouldn't be
18             polling on an issue.  They had limited resources.
19             Polling was in its infancy in these days.  They
20             only had the resources to poll on issues of major
21             public interest.  This was one.
22                   Have you heard or read anything recently to
23             the effect that cigarette smoking may be a cause
24             of cancer of the lung?  90 percent said yes.  Now
25             there was some suggestion to say, oh, they're

 1             reacting to the Frank Statement because that was
 2             out in January.  June 1954 is when the first
 3             American Cancer Society results came out.  Don't
 4             think it's a coincidence.
 5                   Next, 1955 See It Now.  You saw clips from
 6             two half-hour shows consecutive weeks.  The
 7             experts began to get together and compare notes 8             in 1957 and those results were published all over
 9             the country.  1957 Hammond and Horn report came
10             out in this Time magazine coverage of it.  Were
11             people paying attention to that?  We know they
12             were.  77 percent had heard about that very
13             specific study.  Not something by the Tobacco
14             Institute, but that very specific study.
15                   Next, smoking and cancer continue.  This is
16             the first government study.  They studied what
17             was referred to as the veteran study.  They
18             studied the insurance records of World War I
19             veterans and they found as the others did that
20             smokers got lung cancer more often than
21             nonsmokers.
22                   Next, the question then becomes were people
23             paying attention?  Was the information out there?
24             Was it widespread or was it some special need to
25             go above and beyond the publicity to get the

 1             message out?  Dr. Hammond said, no.  In my
 2             opinion, people should be warned of the danger
 3             and they are being warned of the danger.
 4                   Next, the Surgeon General of the United
 5             States 1957.  "Our position is that we have
 6             informed the public through the excellent
 7             coverage of the press, radio and TV."  And the
 8             director of the National Cancer Institute,
 9             "Newspapers, radio, TV and the other media have
10             done an excellent job covering this problem and a
11             very objective job.  This is an exceedingly
12             valuable way of informing the public."
13                   And the American Medical Association, "The
14             health hazards of excessive smoking have been
15             well-publicized for more than ten years and are
16             common knowledge.  Labeling will not alert even
17             the young cigarette smoker to any risks of which
18             he is not already aware."
19                   Okay.  Back to the coverage.  The 1960s,
20             Reader's Digest.  Lung cancer and cigarettes,
21             what are the latest findings.  Royal College of
22             Physicians in Britain is covered in Reader's
23             Digest and is covered in the Pensacola Journal,
24             which also covered it for the appointment, as you
25             see in the title, on the Surgeon General's

 1             committee on smoking and health.  That was 1962
 2             and then a year and a half later in 1964 the
 3             Surgeon General's report came out.
 4                   When it did, it was front page news in
 5             Pensacola.  It was reported in magazines across
 6             the nation.  A special report was broadcast on
 7             NBC, ABC and CBS.  That was watched by Mrs. Gray.
 8             And then we had warning labels.  The 1966 label,
 9             the 1970 label and the rotating warnings in 1985.
10                   Warnings that Dr. Burns called clear --
11             clear warnings, concise message and a frequent
12             message.  It's a message that -- this is the
13             message that Mrs. Gray pointed out to her
14             husband.  Warnings that were covered in the
15             Pensacola paper.  Warnings that were on every
16             single pack of cigarettes he smoked from 1966
17             forward.
18                   Cover-up?  Consider what Dr. Daniel Horn 19             said.  Dr. Horn along with Dr. Hammond were in
20             charge of those studies that were released by the
21             Cancer Society in 1954 and 1957.  He became the
22             head of the federal government's national
23             clearinghouse on smoking and health.  He said in
24             1968, "You could stand on a rooftop and shout
25             smoking is dangerous at the top of your lungs,

 1             and you would not be telling anyone anything they
 2             did not already know."
 3                   So what was covered up?  Well, let's go
 4             back to Claude Teague's memo.  Of course, this
 5             has been pointed out.  This is not original
 6             research.  This was stuff in the library.  The
 7             majority of these or a large part of these being
 8             by Dr. Raffo from Argentina written just before
 9             or during World War II.  This stuff was on
10             library shelves, but nowhere in this memo does he
11             conclude that smoking causes cancer.
12                   What else?  Well, Dr. Cummings said the
13             meetings with Hill & Knowlton in 1953 and the
14             formation of TIRC, later TCR, were part of the
15             cover-up because they were done in secret, that
16             the companies really believed smoking caused lung
17             cancer and this was a humongous fraud, the Frank
18             Statement was a lie, the Frank Statement
19             reassured smokers.
20                   Let's take those one at a time.  Secret:
21             He didn't tell you on direct examination, but on
22             cross-examination, it turned out that the
23             government was informed of the formation of TIRC.
24             The government was informed that Hill & Knowlton
25             had been employed as a public relations agency

 1             and the government was informed that legal
 2             counsel were involved in guiding the TIRC.  The
 3             formation of it was no secret.
 4                   Did they really believe that smoking caused
 5             lung cancer?  Here is a document that
 6             Dr. Cummings concealed from you.  This is another
 7             Hill & Knowlton document I showed him on
 8             cross-examination.  The Hill & Knowlton person
 9             said, they point out that the National Cancer
10             Institute of the U.S. Public Health
11             Administration, which is a government agency and
12             supported by congressional appropriations, has
13             officially refuted the tie-up between cigarette
14             smoking and cancer.  That's the report they were
15             referring to.
16                   What did they conclude?  "The association
17             between cigarette smoking and lung cancer seems
18             real.  The significance remains unestablished."
19             The other conclusions, "The etiological
20             significance of these associations remains
21             unestablished."  He didn't tell you about that
22             until cross-examination.
23                   Was the Frank Statement a lie?  First
24             paragraph talks about the reports on the mouse
25             skin painting with wide publicity.  He said,

 1             well, that's true.  Next, "Although conducted by
 2             doctors of professional standing, these
 3             experiments are not regarded as conclusive in the 4             field of cancer research."  At that point
 5             Dr. Hammond agreed with that, Dr. Mayo of the
 6             Mayo Clinic agreed with that, and Dr. Heller, the
 7             director of the National Cancer Institute agreed
 8             with that, that they weren't conclusive.
 9                   Next, "However, we do not believe that any
10             serious medical research, even though its results
11             are inconclusive, should be disregarded or
12             lightly dismissed."  He called that a responsible
13             statement.  That's the Frank Statement.
14                   Now, he says that TIRC and CTR was a fraud,
15             a gimmick.  Well, let's look at some facts.  TIRC
16             funded the green monster, the key research source
17             for the 1964 Surgeon General's report.  They have
18             funded seven Nobel Prize winners.  They have
19             funded thousands of research grants, including
20             many grants to universities right here in the
21             state of Florida, resulting in thousands of
22             articles published in peer-reviewed journals.
23             They resulted in studies that were cited like 600
24             times in Surgeon General's reports.
25                   Not related to smoking and health?  Let's

 1             take a look.  This is an article in the Journal
 2             of Psychiatry from 1963 on addiction and nicotine
 3             that was cited in the 1988 Surgeon General's
 4             report on nicotine addiction.  It seems pretty
 5             related to smoking and health.  Dr. Cummings
 6             didn't show you that either.
 7                   Another thing that you heard was a secret
 8             that Reynolds kept, benzopyrene was in cigarette
 9             smoke or there were carcinogens in cigarette
10             smoke.  Was it a cover-up?  It was in Reader's
11             Digest in 1950 that benzopyrene was in cigarette
12             smoke.
13                   Did Reynolds know something the public
14             didn't about constituents?  November 1959,
15             Reynolds internal, eight of the polycyclic
16             hydrocarbons isolated from the smoke are known to
17             produce cancer in mice.  This is private.
18                   Public, the coming chemistry discusses,
19             last sentence, eight carcinogenic polycyclics in
20             tobacco smoke and they're on the trail of others.
21                   Same thing.  He showed you an incomplete
22             draft of a memo by Dr. Rodgman.  The version he
23             showed you actually ended in midsentence.  It was
24             six pages long and ended in midsentence.  What he
25             didn't show you but I did on cross-examination

 1             was the complete version that was 24 pages, and
 2             he distorted it a bit by what was in the memo.
 3                   In his version, there's one sentence in the
 4             paragraph.  That's it.  In this version, look at
 5             the size of the paragraph that follows it.  He
 6             left a lot out that qualifies what he read to
 7             you.
 8                   You know, there's more than this.  I think
 9             this kind of makes the point.  You saw and you
10             can read in the jury room all the newspaper
11             articles, all the magazine articles.  You can
12             watch See It Now.  You can watch like Mrs. Gray
13             did on the reports of the '64 Surgeon General's
14             report. 15                   The notion that these isolated appearances
16             by Tobacco Institute personnel on some random
17             news shows or in front of Congress, which might
18             not have even been covered, somehow negated this
19             barrage of publicity we just ran through, that's
20             just against common sense.
21                   Again, remember when Mrs. Gray confronted
22             Mr. Gray about his smoking, he did not argue.  He
23             said I know.  Now we can see how he knew.  He got
24             the message.
25                   Did Mr. Gray rely on anything that R.J.

 1             Reynolds said?  No.  That's another bridge to
 2             nowhere.
 3                   Addiction:  Dr. Cummings says the addictive
 4             nature of smoking was covered up.  You saw quite
 5             a different story.
 6                   Dr. Benowitz, nicotine occurs naturally in
 7             the tobacco plant.  It's been known for over 100
 8             years that nicotine is in tobacco.  It's been
 9             known for 100 years that nicotine has a
10             pharmacological effect on the human body.  People
11             have known for hundreds of years that using
12             tobacco could be difficult to quit.
13                   You saw that even before cigarettes were
14             popular the notion that tobacco was addictive was
15             well known.  John Quincy Adams knew it in 1845,
16             even uses the word addicted.
17                   The State of Florida knew it and publicized
18             it in 1906.  You see the term addiction referring
19             to cigarettes.  This is even before R.J. Reynolds
20             was even formed.
21                   Surgeon General reports reported the
22             scientists were comparing nicotine to hard drugs
23             as long ago as the 1920s and 1930s.  And then we
24             run through Reader's Digest 1935 -- back up,
25             1935.  You say you were a slave to this drug.

 1                   Next, wrestling with an addiction, 1938.
 2             Next, 1941, comparing the lift you get from a
 3             cigarette to the reaction you get from cocaine,
 4             heroin or marijuana.
 5                   Next, 1950, nicotine is the essential
 6             ingredient of tobacco.  It's what makes tobacco
 7             tobacco and not just another weed.
 8                   Next, it talks about the original urge is
 9             purely psychological.  Soon the psychological
10             urge is reinforced by a pharmacological urge, the
11             true physical craving for tobacco.  1952, long
12             before the Surgeon General's report on nicotine.
13                   Newsweek, smoking is a serious sort of drug
14             addiction with a real psychological basis.  1964,
15             the Surgeon General's report summed it up.  "It
16             has psychological and social drives, reinforced,
17             perpetuated by the pharmacological acts of
18             nicotine on the central nervous system."
19                   You saw the newspaper coverage on the Great
20             America Smoke-Out.  Pensacola, you saw ads for
21             noncharlatan smoking cessation clinics in
22             hospitals.  All this was known.  Dr. Benowitz
23             says it's been known for over 100 years.
24                   What exactly was concealed that Mr. Gray
25             couldn't know about in the concept of addiction? 3105
 1             Well, they showed you over and over again that
 2             1994 clip of the CEOs in front of Congress when
 3             they refused to use the word addiction.  In
 4             particular you saw the Reynolds CEO was cut off
 5             when he started talking about the 1964
 6             definition.  Even Dr. Cummings conceded that
 7             that's what happened.
 8                   Mr. Johnston, using the '64 definition,
 9             cigarette smoking is not addiction, it's a habit,
10             right?  They called it a habit.  The last word
11             out of Mr. Johnston's mouth was intoxication.  He
12             was talking about the '64 Surgeon General's
13             definition of addiction.  A difference of opinion
14             over a definition is hardly a cover-up.
15                   But the heart of this cover-up, the most
16             cynical part of this case is the argument that
17             Reynolds was trying to figure out how much
18             nicotine a smoker wants in order to keep them
19             addicted.  Cynical and it's false.
20                   Let me bring you back to the war against
21             tar I talked about in opening.  Tar was the
22             culprit.  Something in tar causes cancer.  Tar
23             was the target.  Tar had to be lowered.  And it
24             was lowered by something like 60 percent.  But
25             those low tar cigarettes didn't have much of a

 1             market.  Smokers wouldn't smoke them.
 2                   So scientists from both sides of the
 3             Atlantic, Dr. Michael Russell, Dr. Richard Sir
 4             Doll, Dr. Gio Gori of the National Cancer
 5             Institute, they advocated lowering tar as much as
 6             possible while maintaining an acceptable level of
 7             nicotine.
 8                   You heard about that from Dr. Figlar and
 9             even Dr. Cummings admitted that that happened and
10             that was the theory for why that happened.
11                   The challenge for the companies was to
12             figure out what was that level of nicotine.  It
13             was discussed in Surgeon General's reports.
14                   A threshold value for acceptability of the
15             consumer, 1981 Surgeon General's report.  Next,
16             it is important to determine the lowest ratios
17             that still produce a satisfying cigarette.
18             That's not coming from Claude Teague.  That's not
19             coming from a R.J. Reynolds internal document.
20             That's coming from the Surgeon General of the
21             United States.  And that's what Dr. Teague was
22             doing in the 1970s with those memos.
23                   Next, please.  I'm sorry, go back.  Find a
24             level of nicotine where they would not smoke
25             more, not switch to a higher tar cigarette in the

 1             same year that Dr. Russell and others, including
 2             the Surgeon General we saw here, were advocating
 3             such a thing.
 4                   The challenge was to find that level of
 5             nicotine, not to hook people, but to follow these
 6             recommendations, to determine the lowest ratios
 7             that still produced the satisfying cigarette as
 8             the Surgeon General said.  His words, not
 9             Reynolds.  A less harmful cigarette that smokers
10             would actually smoke. 11                   You heard from Dr. Figlar that whole effort
12             didn't work.  In the end the war against tar
13             became the war against nicotine and documents
14             like Claude Teague's became trial exhibits all
15             over the country.  And I will concede that
16             Dr. Teague used some stupid language on occasion.
17             And it's the stupidity of that language that
18             makes the document so attractive as trial
19             exhibits.
20                   But the bottom line is all that effort was
21             trying to do with the Surgeon General and
22             prominent scientists were suggesting, lower the
23             exposure of smokers to harmful substances not to
24             keep them addicted.  Even Dr. Benowitz agrees
25             that he wouldn't criticize a company for pursuing

 1             research like that.
 2                   In the end all of this is a side show.
 3             What Reynolds was doing or not doing had nothing
 4             to do with Charles Gray.  There's no evidence he
 5             heard any of it.  Even if you buy Dr. Cummings'
 6             wallpaper theory that somehow, somewhere at some
 7             time and some place Mr. Gray somehow heard
 8             something that someone from the Tobacco Institute
 9             or any other industry organization said, there is
10             no evidence that he relied on it.  None, zero.
11             And nothing that came out of Dr. Cummings' mouth
12             filled that gap.  He can't create reliance where
13             it doesn't exist.
14                   To the contrary the evidence here is that
15             when he was confronted with his smoking behavior
16             by the person closest to him, he never, ever,
17             ever defended his smoking behavior by saying,
18             well, it's really not that bad; it's not going to
19             hurt me; it hasn't been proven it causes cancer;
20             any such thing.  Never, not once.
21                   What did he say?  He said, I know.  And he
22             did know.  He knew and he didn't rely.  There's
23             no proof, no evidence, no building materials for
24             a bridge in this courtroom.  No proof that he had
25             relied on it and you have to check no on question

 1             four on the verdict form.
 2                   There are five questions on the verdict
 3             form and I'm arguing here you should never get to
 4             question five because question five deals with
 5             punitive damages.  If you get to question five,
 6             you will have already on the form fully
 7             compensated Mrs. Gray for her loss.
 8                   Question five is not about compensation for
 9             loss.  Question five is about more money.  If you
10             check question five, you'll come back on Monday
11             to see how much more money you'll be giving
12             Mrs. Gray.
13                   Punitive damages, damages designed to
14             punish, damages for conduct that's tantamount to
15             reckless disregard for human life, and you have
16             to meet a higher standard of proof, the judge
17             will tell you about it, clear and convincing
18             evidence.  Obviously we're here arguing they have
19             proven no such thing.
20                   Punish Reynolds?  Well, you heard that
21             Reynolds engaged in a 50 year effort to make 22             safer cigarettes through all those various forms.
23             And they did reduce tar and nicotine in
24             Mr. Gray's Winston.
25                   Yesterday Mr. Loehr asked Dr. Figlar

 1             several times, do you have an addiction reduction
 2             program?  Have you ever had a nicotine reduction
 3             program?  Well, here it is.  The bottom line.
 4             When tar comes down, nicotine comes down.
 5             There's some isolated years, and you heard about
 6             it from Dr. Cummings where nicotine might have
 7             went up, but the overall picture for Mr. Gray's
 8             smoking history is it's gone down.  It's gone
 9             down and when tar goes down, nicotine goes down.
10             There is your nicotine reduction program.
11                   Reynolds cooperated with the federal
12             government in the tobacco working group.  They
13             worked to develop a less hazardous cigarette, and
14             the important part is it wasn't just they
15             cooperated.  The cooperation was directed by the
16             president of the company.
17                   Take a look.  If there is a safer
18             cigarette -- they never wrote anything about
19             health, they never wrote anything about people's
20             health -- if there is a safer cigarette, this is
21             the president, let's continue and increase our
22             efforts in the program.  Please prepare a plan to
23             carry it out.
24                   And the interesting thing is this memo went
25             to Dr. Murray Senkus.  Yesterday you heard a lot

 1             of quotes from a speech of Dr. Senkus saying, we
 2             weren't interested in helping people's health.
 3             We did it for health reasons.  We did it because
 4             of market share.  Well, the president of the
 5             company told him to do it and he told him to do
 6             it to get a safer cigarette.
 7                   This isn't the kind of document that is not
 8             written, intended to be a trial exhibit.  The
 9             president of the company didn't write this in
10             1968 thinking it would be a trial exhibit in the
11             year 2010.
12                   This is what he directed his subordinates
13             to do, to cooperate to try to do a safer
14             cigarette.  About a safer cigarette, not about
15             market share.
16                   Reynolds scientists published articles.
17             They attended conferences.  They gave talks about
18             Reynolds product development efforts.  You heard
19             that from Dr. Figlar yesterday.
20                   They made a revolutionary break-through in
21             the '80s with Premier.  Incredible reductions.
22             We've been hearing about benzo(a)pyrene for weeks
23             now, 99 percent reduction.  Tobacco specific
24             nitrosamines, 90 percent and above reduction.
25             Benzene, 92 percent of reduction.  This was not

 1             done -- this was done specifically to try to get
 2             down the harmful constituents in cigarette smoke.
 3                   It was heated instead of burned tobacco.
 4             It was endorsed, as you saw yesterday, by
 5             Dr. Michael Russell of Great Britain.  He had a
 6             long-standing interest in Premier.  He thought it 7             had tremendous potential for low risk long-term
 8             nicotine use.  The response to it in this country
 9             was political and irrational.  He writes because
10             it would be very sad if Reynolds were to abandon
11             further development of such a valuable product.
12                   Well, Reynolds didn't let Dr. Russell down
13             because next came Eclipse.  It's on the market
14             today.  Again, tremendous reductions, not as deep
15             as Premier, but tremendous reductions in
16             nitrosamines, benzene and any number of the
17             suspect compounds that are in cigarette smoke.
18             On the market today.
19                   Is this reckless disregard for human life?
20             Well, Dr. Benowitz doesn't think so.  He's
21             testified here there was some research conference
22             at Duke to look at Eclipse as a harm reduction
23             strategy with smoking, right?  Sponsored by
24             Reynolds and Duke?  I guess so.  And following
25             the conference, am I correct that it was your

 1             opinion that most participants at the conference
 2             agreed that a Eclipse is less likely to be
 3             harmful than smoking regular cigarettes with
 4             respect to cancer and lung disease, although
 5             there may be no impact on risk of heart disease?
 6             Yes, less harmful than smoking regular cigarettes
 7             with respect to cancer and lung disease.
 8             Dr. Benowitz having good things to say about
 9             Eclipse.  This is not a reckless disregard for
10             human life.
11                   And finally something you also heard from
12             Dr. Benowitz.  Targacept.  Reynolds developed and
13             refreshed and spun off a company that did work
14             and is doing work on pharmaceuticals using
15             nicotine in treating Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
16             disease.
17                   This is not a reckless disregard for human
18             life.  Dr. Benowitz agrees.  Would you agree with
19             the bottom line point, Dr. Benowitz, that using
20             the nicotine related research that Reynolds did
21             to try to develop therapeutic products that are
22             interactive nicotine receptors, is that good
23             research to be done?  I think it could be
24             valuable, yes.
25                   Ladies and Gentlemen, this is not a record

 1             that indicates indifference to human life.  It's
 2             not a record that warrants an award of punitive
 3             damages.  So when you get to question five on the
 4             verdict form, I'm asking you to check no.
 5                   Wrapping up.  By all accounts, Ladies and
 6             Gentlemen, Mr. Gray was a smart and decent and
 7             honorable man.  He made choices throughout his
 8             life.  He accepted the consequences for them.
 9             Some of those choices related to smoking.  He
10             chose to smoke with his brother with roll your
11             own that he got from the Hayes boys.  We should
12             respect that choice.
13                   He chose to continue to smoke.  He made
14             that choice every day, every time he opened a
15             package of cigarettes, a choice he made for the
16             last 28 years of his life staring at a warning
17             label in his face, a warning label that Dr. Burns 18             called clear, concise and frequent.
19                   He made that choice to continue to smoke
20             after quitting for a year.  And we know that that
21             choice was not made because of nicotine, because
22             the nicotine was out of his system, because of
23             brain receptors, because they were back to
24             normal, and because of withdrawal, because he
25             actually had no withdrawal; and if he had had it,

 1             the symptoms would long since be gone.
 2                   This was a choice that Dr. Keefe says was
 3             the cause of his death, his choice.  We should
 4             also respect his choice to accept personal
 5             responsibility.  He did not file a lawsuit.  We
 6             should respect that choice as well.
 7                   Charles Gray was not a victim during his
 8             life.  You should not make him a victim in his
 9             death.
10                   This is the only chance I get to speak to
11             you.  Mr. Loehr, representing the plaintiff, with
12             the burden of proof, will get an opportunity for
13             rebuttal.  I would ask, however, since I can't
14             respond to what he's going to say, that one of
15             you serve as my advocate in the jury room and
16             perhaps for discussion sake answer him as you
17             think I would.
18                   Again, I thank you for your service.  I
19             thank you for your attention.  And once again we
20             just couldn't do it without you.  Thank you very
21             much.
