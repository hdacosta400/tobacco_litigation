 7                   MR. LOEHR:  May it please the Court,
 8             Counsel, and Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury.
 9             We've been together for several weeks now and
10             it's been a real pleasure, and I hope you've
11             appreciated the way this case has been tried by
12             both sides.  It's quite obvious here that the
13             stakes are very high.
14                   Closing argument is a time when we get a
15             little bit more adversarial than we have been in
16             the past.  I'm sure I speak for Mr. Kaczynski
17             when I say nothing I say here this morning is
18             meant as any sort of a slight to the defense
19             counsel in this case.  They have all been
20             extremely -- they are extremely talented,
21             competent, and they have done an excellent job of
22             presenting their case.
23                   That being said, it's now your job as
24             jurors to decide right from wrong in this case,
25             to take a look at all the evidence that you've

 1             seen.  You've got to decide truth from lies,
 2             sense from nonsense, reality from illusion.
 3             You've heard a lot that goes into all those
 4             categories in the last several weeks.
 5                   You will actually reach your decision with
 6             a verdict form that I'm going to show you in a
 7             minute.  The verdict form simply asks you a
 8             number of questions.  You'll go back into a room,
 9             quiet by yourselves, nobody knows what goes on,
10             no court reporter, and you'll do justice as
11             jurors have been doing for over 1,200 years in
12             our system, for 1,000 years over in New England
13             before we brought the system here with us.
14                   The case really boils down to some simple
15             issues.  We walked into the courtroom and
16             actually when we filed our complaint, Carolyn
17             Gray admitted that her husband made choices, that
18             those choices contributed to his death and that
19             he is responsible for those choices.  There will
20             be a place on the verdict form for you to address
21             that.  But R.J. Reynolds in this case claims
22             they're blameless.  They claim that you should
23             put a zero next to the spot on the verdict form
24             for them.
25                   It's very important as we go through this
3019 1             that we understand what the law is regarding what
 2             caused Charles Gray's death because it's very,
 3             very different from what you heard from Dr. Keefe
 4             on behalf of the defendants.
 5                   In fact, the first question on the verdict
 6             form, if I can have the Elmo.  The first question
 7             is, was addiction to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
 8             Company cigarettes a legal cause of the death of
 9             Charles Gray?
10                   So you have to ask yourself, number one,
11             what does legal cause mean and how does it play
12             into a case like this?  You will be instructed,
13             you'll be given specific instructions by the
14             Court on that issue.
15                   We talked about this at the very beginning
16             in jury selection.  I gave you an example that
17             I'm going to repeat here in just a moment.
18             "Addiction is a legal cause of death if it
19             directly and in a natural and continuous sequence
20             produces or contributes substantially to
21             producing such death, so that it can reasonably
22             be said that but for the addiction to cigarettes
23             containing nicotine, the death would not have
24             occurred."
25                   If it directly and in a natural and

 1             continuous sequence produces or contributes
 2             substantially to producing the death.  But that's
 3             not the end of the instruction.
 4                   "In order to be regarded as a legal cause
 5             of death, addiction need not be the only cause.
 6             Addiction may be a legal cause of death even
 7             though it operates in combination with the act of
 8             another or some other cause, if such other cause
 9             occurs at the same time as the addiction and the
10             addiction contributes substantially to producing
11             such death."
12                   I will talk about that more in a few
13             minutes, but it's very important to keep that in
14             mind because addiction combined with Charles
15             Gray's choices did cause his death.  The two of
16             them combined together.  He never would have
17             gotten there without both of them.  We will talk
18             about that more in a few minutes.
19                   But that is the way our law has evolved.
20             We talked in jury selection about the fact that
21             we used to have a law in Florida that says if a
22             drunk driver was careening down the road in a
23             residential neighborhood doing 60 miles an hour,
24             someone came from a side street, a horrendous
25             accident occurred and the person coming from the

 1             side street was killed, everybody recognized that
 2             the drunk driver should be held legally
 3             responsible.  But our old law in Florida said if
 4             that person rolled through a stop sign, if that
 5             person did anything wrong, one percent wrong,
 6             then the drunk driver got off scot-free.
 7                   It was called contributory negligence, any
 8             contributory negligence and it absolved the other
 9             person of any responsibility.  Our law has done
10             away with that now.
11                   We've changed entirely to a comparative 12             negligence analysis that was just shown to you
13             that says it recognizes real life.  It recognizes
14             reality.  It recognizes that life is difficult.
15             It's messy, it's sloppy.  And sometimes it's
16             wonderful, sometimes it's not, and most of the
17             time things are complicated.  They happen for
18             various reasons.  They're not black and white.
19             They're not cut and dried.  It's not simple cause
20             and effect.  Things combine together to bring
21             about results, and our law says the question that
22             you have to answer is whether addiction was a
23             substantial contributing factor to the death of
24             Charles Gray.
25                   Would he ever have died of lung cancer if

 1             he hadn't been addicted to cigarettes?  And we'll
 2             go through that in more detail as we go along.
 3                   You will be instructed by the Court there
 4             are several findings that help you answer that
 5             first question.  One finding is that Charles Gray
 6             was, in fact, addicted to cigarettes containing
 7             nicotine and that his smoking of cigarettes was
 8             the medical cause of his death.  Those are not
 9             issues here.  Nobody is claiming he died of
10             anything else.  Believe it or not nobody is
11             claiming he died of bladder cancer or that the
12             bladder cancer would have done anything to
13             shorten his life in any way, shape or form.
14             Those are not even issues in this case.
15                   To begin to look at this case, you have to
16             do something that's very difficult and that is
17             you have to envision America as it existed way
18             back in the '30s, '40s, '50s, times when I
19             certainly wasn't here, times when things were
20             different.  Then you have to take yourself into a
21             little rural town called Smith Station, Alabama
22             just outside the bigger town of Phenix City,
23             Alabama to a place where Charles Gray was born
24             and grew up.  If we could see GRA521.28.
25                   You've seen the photograph of the kind of

 1             humble beginnings of Charles Gray with his family
 2             back in Alabama.  They had some animals, lived in
 3             a very rural setting.  His life was simpler, but
 4             in some ways it was very, very different than it
 5             is now.
 6                   Eighty percent of the people born in the
 7             era of Charles Gray, nearly 80 percent, Dr. Burns
 8             said 79 percent of them became regular cigarette
 9             smokers.  Far different than it is now.  The vast
10             majority of them started very young, just like
11             Charles Gray did.
12                   It is a different place.  We would be
13             smoking in the courtroom right now.  Doctors
14             smoked in their offices.  There were no
15             nonsmoking areas anywhere.  Women weren't smoking
16             as heavily then as now.  They took up the habit a
17             little bit later.  But in order to envision the
18             choices that Charles Gray made, it's only fair to
19             look at him in the context that he grew up.
20                   To assist you in answering that first
21             question whether addiction was a legal cause of
22             Charles Gray's loss, we brought into the 23             courtroom what you would have to conclude were
24             the most qualified men anywhere, the most
25             qualified doctors, both medical doctors and a

 1             Ph.D. on public health to tell you what they have
 2             told physician's groups all over the world, to
 3             give you the same kind of information that they
 4             lecture about routinely, to give you the same
 5             kind of information that they have written about
 6             in scientific studies.
 7                   Dr. Benowitz was the first witness, a full
 8             professor at the University of California in San
 9             Francisco.  He's authored over 350 peer-reviewed
10             articles, vast majority of them dealing with the
11             issues of nicotine addiction.  Over 70 book
12             chapters.  He was the editor of the 1988 Surgeon
13             General's report on addiction.  He's lectured all
14             over the world.  I read a long list of them,
15             throughout Europe.  I think he lectured in China.
16             I'm not sure even how you do that, but he did.
17             He's consulted with the World Health
18             Organization, National Cancer Institute, National
19             Institutes of Health.
20                   He took the stand and he gave and showed
21             you the very same things that he tells anyone,
22             the patients that he treated and the doctors that
23             he teaches, the public health officials that he
24             teaches.
25                   Dr. Cummings took the stand.  A Ph.D. in

 1             public health.  He runs one of the largest
 2             cessation clinics around up in New York.  The
 3             attorney general of the State of New York chose
 4             him to be the recipient of all the documents that
 5             came from the Tobacco Institute, the group that
 6             was formed years ago to carry out the wishes of
 7             the tobacco industry and serve as their public
 8             relations arm.
 9                   Dr. Cummings has written over 250
10             peer-reviewed articles.  He, too, has contributed
11             to multiple Surgeon General reports.
12                   Then David Burns took the stand, professor
13             of medicine, now in emeritus status at the
14             University of California at San Diego.  Dr. Burns
15             has authored over 150 peer-reviewed articles.
16             He's written the two articles on nicotine
17             addiction and its effects in the leading internal
18             medicine textbooks that are used in virtually
19             every medical school in the United States.  He
20             studied from them when he was a medical student
21             at Harvard, and now medical students at Harvard
22             read his words on nicotine addiction and its
23             effects.
24                   Not surprisingly, these men are often
25             called upon to provide testimony to juries just

 1             like you.  Who else would you have us bring?  Is
 2             there anyone else that you've seen or heard in
 3             any of this trial that would be more prepared to
 4             tell you -- and what did they each tell you?  A
 5             consistent story.
 6                   Dr. Benowitz did not give an opinion about
 7             Mr. Gray individually.  He just taught us 8             generally about addiction.  Both Dr. Cummings and
 9             Dr. Burns told you with no hesitation, no doubt
10             whatsoever that addiction was not only a
11             contributing cause of Charles Gray's death, but
12             addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was
13             the overwhelming cause of his death.  They used
14             words like it drove his smoking.  They used words
15             like it clearly was a heavy contributing factor.
16             He would not have died without it.
17                   And it all makes sense when you think about
18             it, and when you look at what they told you and
19             what we all knew anyway before we even came in
20             about addiction.
21                   If we could see visual number two, please.
22             It's common sense, but each of these witnesses
23             who have spent their life studying it agreed that
24             this is what happens.  You start out with
25             experimentation of a drug that has an addictive

 1             quality.  As you move further and further along,
 2             you get to where you're using it regularly.  Then
 3             you finally get to a point where you're using it
 4             every day.  Every step along that way you're
 5             beginning to lose some of the control that you
 6             have.
 7                   Now, let me make it clear from the outset.
 8             No witness for the plaintiff's side, and it never
 9             came out of my mouth, told you it's impossible to
10             quit smoking.  That's sort of something that the
11             defense has built up so that they can knock it
12             down and act like they won on an issue.
13                   We never told you it was impossible to quit
14             smoking.  None of our witnesses said it was
15             impossible to quit smoking.  If it was, we
16             wouldn't have admitted that Charles Gray shares
17             in the blame for his death.
18                   But your control is affected.  You start
19             losing some of your control.  It's no longer a
20             free choice and your chance of relapse goes up
21             and up and up.  These are not my words.  They're
22             words of men who have written over 800
23             peer-reviewed articles on these very issues.
24                   If we could go to number three, please,
25             Ryan.  They explained to you why, especially Dr.

 1             Benowitz, took a lot of time explaining the brain
 2             changes that go on with nicotine addiction, just
 3             like any other drug, anything that causes
 4             dependence, that causes addiction sets off things
 5             in the brain.  It sets off the release of brain
 6             hormones in the reward centers of the brain.
 7                   Those brain hormones after you do it time
 8             and time and time and time and time and time
 9             again, the brain starts trying to regulate
10             itself.  It turns down the release of those
11             hormones striving for normality which causes
12             tolerance.
13                   There's another part of your brain that
14             wants that feeling.  That's why they're
15             addictive.  That's why it works.  So you start
16             smoking more or you start using more heroin or
17             you start drinking more.  What that brings about
18             is when you try to stop, when you try to stop the 19             drug, the brain doesn't return to normal,
20             especially if you've done it over and over again
21             for years and years and years.  The brain returns
22             to a lower level of those brain hormones, which
23             sets off withdrawal symptoms, which brings about
24             cravings, which brings about the compulsion to
25             smoke.

 1                   Anyone who enters this process, it's
 2             different.  It's different for everyone.
 3             Dr. Benowitz told you some of it is genetic, some
 4             people have no control over it.  I think the
 5             picture is very clear that Charles Gray was
 6             heavily and strongly addicted.
 7                   With nicotine it comes about -- see number
 8             22, please -- it comes about in different ways
 9             with different forms of nicotine.  Leaf tobacco,
10             which is used in pipes and cigars is not inhaled.
11             It's not designed to be inhaled.  It's not
12             engineered to be inhaled.  So people take it into
13             their mouth, a little bit into the windpipe.  It
14             causes very slow delivery through the mucous
15             membranes up to the brain.  It brings in very few
16             receptors.  You have very low amounts that get to
17             the brain and obviously there's no lung
18             involvement.
19                   Cigarettes have been designed from the very
20             beginning -- number 20 is up next -- cigarettes
21             on the other hand were designed from the
22             beginning all the additives that they use, all
23             the treatments that they use, all the flavorants
24             that they use, careful blending of the
25             cigarettes, they're designed to be deeply inhaled

 1             into the lungs.  The lungs are a vascular organ.
 2             They have tons of blood running through them.
 3             You heard that the nicotine gets to the brain in
 4             a matter of seconds when it goes through the
 5             lung.  It gets to the brain in much higher
 6             concentrations and it sets off far more of these
 7             nicotinic receptors and that sets off hormonal
 8             brain changes that are a hallmark of addiction to
 9             nicotine.
10                   You saw with Dr. Benowitz the slides that
11             he showed comparing the brain of a smoker with
12             the brain of a nonsmoker.  It had all of that
13             yellow lit up, all the nicotinic receptors the
14             smoker's brain had and nonsmoker's didn't have.
15                   It causes physical changes in the brain.
16             Some of them are short-term.  Those yellow things
17             you saw on the slide that were so lit up in the
18             smoker and not in the nonsmoker, they go back to
19             normal after a while.  But Dr. Benowitz told you
20             about neuroplasticity.  The memory circuitry that
21             becomes built into the brain that does not go
22             away.  It's permanent.
23                   Dr. Keefe even told you, he said he hadn't
24             seen it on PET scans, but he read studies that
25             you could see on PET scans that that's what

 1             causes cravings for people years after they stop
 2             smoking.  They walk by someplace that reminds
 3             them of a cigarette and if you happen to have a 4             PET scan handy, you'll see the brain start to
 5             light up.  The actual brain changes never go
 6             away, and again this isn't me saying it.  It's
 7             the world renowned experts who testified to you.
 8                   Number 30, please.  They also told you that
 9             there is a range of levels of addiction and that
10             can't be a surprise to anybody.  It seemed to be
11             a surprise to Dr. Keefe, but certainly some
12             people have a much more difficult time dealing
13             with addictions than others.  And there's a whole
14             body of literature, some of it written by the men
15             you saw, some of it written by others, that deal
16             with looking at what factors go into making one
17             person more heavily addicted than another person.
18             How can we predict it and what does it mean?
19                   They look at things like if you're older
20             when you start, you're generally going to be less
21             heavily addicted.  If you're a lighter smoker,
22             you're going to be less heavily addicted.  If you
23             don't smoke for very long, that's a sign of less
24             heavy addiction; and if you don't crave a
25             cigarette first thing in the morning, which is a

 1             sign of withdrawal because you've been all night
 2             without it, you're likely to be a less addictive
 3             smoker.
 4                   On the other hand, people who start very
 5             young, people who smoke more for a longer
 6             duration are likely to have those withdrawal
 7             signs that cause them to go for a cigarette very
 8             quickly in the morning.
 9                   When you look at that and ask yourself
10             where does Charles Gray fit on that scale, why
11             did Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns, who have spent
12             their life studying this issue, tell you that he
13             was very heavily addicted?  Because he started
14             very young, nearly 15 years before the first
15             warnings ever went on cigarettes.
16                   He was a heavy smoker.  He smoked for a
17             long time.  It showed itself through the fact
18             that first thing in the morning when he got up,
19             he would grab a cigarette.  You heard that he
20             smoked in bed sometimes.  You heard that
21             sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night
22             to smoke.  Whatever the factors are that cause
23             someone to be heavily addicted, they were all
24             there with Charles Gray.
25                   If we can see the next slide.  So what did

 1             that mean?  What does it matter whether he's
 2             strongly addicted or not?
 3                   You heard numerous times that addiction,
 4             cigarette addiction is a chronic relapsing
 5             disease, a chronic relapsing disease.  Well, does
 6             the strength of addiction have anything to do
 7             with that?  You know, all of this was common
 8             sense, wasn't it?  It wouldn't be very difficult
 9             to do all of these things without 800
10             peer-reviewed articles, Surgeon General reports.
11             Dr. Burns has been involved in every one since
12             1975, the Surgeon General reports on smoking.
13                   The more strongly addicted you are, the
14             more likely you are to relapse.  We saw that with 15             Charles Gray.  It makes common sense.  It's
16             difficult to deny.  It just happens.  You see it
17             with alcoholics.  You see it with drug addicts.
18             It's a common factor in addictions to anything.
19                   You're likely to have more and stronger
20             cravings.  It shows up with more compulsion with
21             heavier smoking.  You have more marked brain
22             changes, especially when you start smoking when
23             you're a teenager, a young teenager back in the
24             late '40s when cigarettes had three times as much
25             nicotine as they have now.

 1                   Have you asked yourself why does it seem
 2             like this is a generational disease?  Why does it
 3             seem like so many people who are older have such
 4             a hard time stopping smoking?  Nearly 90 percent
 5             of them started before their 18th birthday.
 6             Unfortunately, that's still true today.  But they
 7             started smoking cigarettes that had three times
 8             as much nicotine.  All of the things that go on
 9             in the brain that Dr. Benowitz talked about were
10             supercharged back in the '40s, back in the '50s.
11             All of those things with Charles Gray pointed to
12             the fact that his addiction played a very
13             powerful role in his smoking.
14                   Now, his choices did too.  There's no doubt
15             about that.  His choices played a role.  They
16             function together with his powerful addiction,
17             the two of them combined, to cause his death.
18                   You'll hear that he wasn't motivated.  He
19             didn't do anything to try to quit, he didn't do
20             this or he didn't do that.  The evidence shows
21             that he used the only two smoking cessation aids
22             available to him at the time.  He used Nicorette
23             gum.  He was chewing it at the restaurant.  He
24             was chewing it during the year that he stopped
25             smoking.  He was chewing it later.  He used

 1             patches after his lung cancer diagnosis.  That
 2             was it.  That's what was there.
 3                   He's been criticized for not going to a
 4             stop smoking clinic.  That's fine.  He should
 5             have gone.  You're doggone right.  He should have
 6             been stronger.  He shouldn't have been so human.
 7             He shouldn't have been so weak.  We admit it.  We
 8             admitted it from the onset.
 9                   But to say that addiction didn't play any
10             role in it, the only way you can do that is if
11             you do what Dr. Keefe did on that witness stand.
12             Come up with some odd form of definition of
13             causation that wasn't contained in the DSM-IV.
14             It wasn't contained in any of the books that he
15             had, any of his reliance materials.  Every time I
16             asked him, it says here addiction causes disease,
17             it says here that nicotine kills more people than
18             all the other drugs of abuse combined.  The
19             DSM-IV says that.  It's your book, Dr. Keefe,
20             from the American Psychiatric Association.
21                   He says, oh, no addiction doesn't kill
22             people and nicotine doesn't kill people.  It's
23             the smoke that kills people.  He disagrees with
24             everything on his reliance list.  He couldn't
25             point to one thing, one peer-reviewed article, 3036
 1             one Surgeon General's report, anything that backs
 2             him up.
 3                   That's the only way you can reach the
 4             conclusion that they're going to ask you to
 5             reach.  Dr. Keefe, who has never written anything
 6             on the subject matter.  He's never studied it to
 7             any extent.  He took his reliance list from the
 8             lawyers at Shook, Hardy and Bacon who served on
 9             the board of directors of the Tobacco Institute,
10             the very organization that sponsored the video
11             clips that you've seen, and you'll see again in a
12             moment.
13                   Dr. Keefe, who told you addiction to heroin
14             has never killed anybody, addiction to alcohol
15             has never killed anybody.  He says addiction is a
16             construct.  It's a group of symptoms put together
17             in the DSM-IV.  How could that kill someone?
18                   Well, that's not the law.  That's not the
19             science.  That's not medicine.  I'm not sure what
20             to call it.  But he sure as heck wouldn't write
21             it down anywhere and try to have it peer-reviewed
22             because it goes against every single thing in the
23             literature.  He couldn't point out one thing to
24             back him up.
25                   Unfortunately, relapse is the norm not the

 1             exception.  This is what happened on Chantix, the
 2             new, the best drug that we've been able to come
 3             up with at this point.  It actually blocks the
 4             affinity of some of the nicotine receptors in the
 5             brain.  It's a great idea, and it seems to work
 6             for some people.  It has a relapse rate, you
 7             heard, of 75 to 80 percent in the first year.
 8             The wonder drug, the best we can do has turned
 9             that 95 into 75 or 80 percent relapse, still
10             leaving a very small number of people.
11                   It's hard to understand.  The doctors did
12             the best they could to teach us.  You may still
13             be saying, gosh, I just don't see it.  All these
14             people aren't smoking to kill themselves.
15             Charlie Gray didn't smoke because he didn't like
16             his life, because he was ready to leave his wife
17             or wanted to leave his children.  Unfortunately,
18             he smoked because he got caught up in an
19             addiction when he was very young, an addiction
20             that he was unable to deal with and unable to
21             handle.
22                   He's not alone.  Can we see number nine,
23             please?  In the United States we still today have
24             45 million people who are smoking cigarettes.
25             50 million people in the red circle have smoked

 1             at least five packs in their life, that would
 2             include social smokers, light smokers in college,
 3             but don't currently smoke.  Unfortunately, as you
 4             saw from the relapse numbers, those groups move
 5             back and forth.  They're not mutually exclusive.
 6                   The smokers quit, the quitters smoke, kind
 7             of like Dr. Figlar, who went to work for a
 8             cigarette company, stopped smoking, started using
 9             oral things, chewing tobacco first and then Snus,
10             and after years started smoking again.  So it 11             happens.
12                   The overwhelming evidence in this case,
13             overwhelming, is that Charles Gray, his addiction
14             was a substantial contributing factor to his
15             death.  It didn't happen by itself.  It went
16             together with his own choices, if you want to
17             call it that, his relapses, his inability to
18             break out of that addiction process, his human
19             weakness, call it what you will; but if Charles
20             Gray hadn't been addicted, he would have simply
21             been what, a social smoker.
22                   We actually met one in jury selection,
23             smoked about a pack a month.  No one dies from
24             that.  It takes 30 years of that kind of smoking
25             to get one pack year, one pack year.  It takes a

 1             minimum of somewhere around ten pack years, you
 2             heard, to even start the risk, any serious risk
 3             of lung cancer.  That kind of smoker would have
 4             to smoke 300 years to run the risk.
 5                   It is addiction that makes people stand
 6             outside buildings in the rain and cold to puff
 7             down a cigarette during their cigarette break.
 8             It's addiction that makes people smoke when
 9             they're shunned, like they are now.  It's
10             addiction that makes people smoke when they have
11             to go out in their backyard to smoke a cigarette,
12             out on the back porch.  They're not just choosing
13             to die.  It's addiction that plays a heavy role,
14             and unfortunately that addiction, see number 10,
15             kills 440,000 Americans every year.
16                   Dr. Cummings told you it's killed over 12
17             million people since the Surgeon General's report
18             in 1964.  Charles Gray is certainly not alone.
19             Charles Gray is one of many.
20                   Let's see number 22, please.  This is
21             simply an illustration of what we've been talking
22             about.  This is an illustration of concurring
23             cause, the instruction that Judge Terrell will
24             give you that you must follow in this case.  Two
25             things occurred to cause death and death could

 1             not have occurred without both of them.
 2                   Death would not have occurred if Charles
 3             Gray had managed to stop, if he had managed to
 4             put those cigarettes down early enough, he
 5             wouldn't have died.  That's why we admitted that
 6             his own choices were a part of the cause.  But
 7             you never would have got to that point, you never
 8             would have gotten to him even wanting to quit,
 9             there would have been no reason to quit had he
10             been a social smoker.  You remember that visual
11             we put up.  The social smoker has such a small
12             exposure to cigarette smoke compared to the
13             addicted smoker.  It never would have happened
14             without both of them.
15                   As we move through the verdict form, the
16             second question says, "State the percentage of
17             any fault that was a legal cause of Charles
18             Gray's death that you charge to the two parties."
19                   That's what so much of the evidence was
20             about that we showed during the trial.  The
21             history of addiction in America.  How in the 22             world did we get where we got to, where we had
23             80 percent of Charles Gray's age group smoking,
24             nearly 50 percent of adult Americans smoking,
25             4,000 cigarettes sold for every person over the

 1             age of 18 in the United States on a yearly basis,
 2             billions and billions and billions of cigarettes
 3             sold?
 4                   You saw the document that Claude Teague did
 5             in 1953.  If we could see LP395, please.  Claude
 6             Teague in 1953, the birth of the R & D department
 7             at R.J. Reynolds is what you've been told.  If we
 8             can go to Page 13, please.
 9                   Claude Teague was charged as a new chemist
10             at the company in looking around to see what
11             information was out there, the scientific
12             literature about cancer, about smoking and
13             cancer, about tobacco and cancer, and what he
14             found is an indictment of R.J. Reynolds plain and
15             simple.
16                   All the way back to the early 1900s, all
17             the way through 1932, all the way through the
18             '30s and the '40s, study after study after study
19             showing cancer, cancer, carcinoma, papilloma,
20             metaplasia, carcinoma, some of them no effect,
21             tumors, cancer.
22                   All of this at a time when you've been told
23             R.J. Reynolds didn't do the first thing to
24             research their own products.  Nothing.  They were
25             selling billions of them at this point.  And the

 1             testimony you've heard is we had no idea.  We
 2             didn't know.
 3                   You're going to hear something from Judge
 4             Terrell that tells you when you hear testimony,
 5             especially expert testimony, from the chemists
 6             like Dr. Figlar, you can accept it, you can
 7             reject it, or you can give it the weight you
 8             think it's worth.  Is it possible that R.J.
 9             Reynolds didn't sit around and discuss it, they
10             didn't do anything, they didn't look at it, they
11             didn't have these in their files?
12                   The bibliography at the back of this was 78
13             articles long.  Most of them available in the
14             '30s and '40s.  Most of them available back at
15             the time when Charles Gray was a child.
16                   R.J. Reynolds got drug into creating an
17             R & D department when it became front page news.
18             They didn't care who they killed.  They didn't
19             care who they addicted before that.  They didn't
20             care what their products did to anybody until it
21             was front page news with some mice on the front
22             of the newspaper that grew tumors on their back
23             and they couldn't ignore it any longer.
24                   Then I asked Dr. Figlar, did R.J. Reynolds
25             ever -- were you ever the first one to point out

 1             any carcinogen?  No.  Were you ever the first one
 2             to point out any ciliastat, the damages to the
 3             reparative structure of the lung?  No.  Were you
 4             ever the first one to point out phenols?  No.
 5             Were you the first one to point out that
 6             flue-cured, the way you cured your tobacco, was 7             increasing cancer?  No.
 8                   They got drug along the whole way.  They
 9             didn't publish anything first.  You saw some of
10             the reasons why.  The legal department was
11             involved over and over again.  The legal
12             department would say, you can't do that, it will
13             affect our ability to defend cases.
14                   But what they did do, what they did do once
15             they knew in 1952, 1953, they knew what was going
16             on, they couldn't deny it anymore, the
17             epidemiological studies came out showing huge
18             increases of cancer -- you remember the line,
19             cigarette use is like this and lung cancer was
20             like this, rising along with it 20 years later.
21                   What did they do?  They got together with
22             all other competitors at the Plaza Hotel in New
23             York City, December of 1953, and they all made a
24             decision and what they decided is chilling.  They
25             decided to withhold the information that they

 1             had.  They decided to never release, never admit,
 2             never tell anybody what we know.  Don't share
 3             Claude Teague's conclusions that it's probably
 4             these things that are causing cancer.  It looks
 5             like the relationship has been shown between
 6             smoking and lung cancer, keep all of that quiet
 7             and fight like heck.  Form a new group, TIRC and
 8             fight.
 9                   That decision has caused more suffering and
10             more death than any other decision in the history
11             of America and you'd have to look hard to find
12             any other decisions that devastating.  12 million
13             people since 1964.
14                   They decided to make it as easy as possible
15             for people to start smoking and as hard as
16             possible for people to stop smoking and as easy
17             as possible for people to relapse.
18                   If we could see LP185, please.  This is a
19             forwarding memo from Hill & Knowlton, the public
20             relations firm that all the major manufacturers
21             met with in December.  They didn't meet with
22             doctors.  They didn't meet with scientists.  I
23             guess they didn't have an R & D department at the
24             time, but they met with a public relations firm,
25             a public relations firm that they had a long-time

 1             relationship from that point forward.  Turn to
 2             Page 2, please, Ryan.
 3                   The first paragraph of this, this is a
 4             Hill & Knowlton supervisor writing, "The attitude
 5             of the men we must direct is one interesting and
 6             important for us to understand.  This is why
 7             notes of the four interviews with research
 8             directors are given at some length.  You'll get
 9             from them little real information about lung
10             cancer, pro or con, but you'll find some mighty
11             interesting opinions."  One of them said, "It's
12             fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they
13             can't break."
14                   They have just learned indisputably that
15             cigarettes are causing lung cancer in alarming
16             numbers, not just the epidemiological studies,
17             the mice that have tumors on their backs.  "It's 18             fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they
19             can't break.  Said another, boy, wouldn't it be
20             wonderful if our company was the first to produce
21             a cancer free cigarette?  What we could do to the
22             competition."
23                   Sometimes sentences say more than they
24             seem.  The first part of that is not so bad,
25             wouldn't it be wonderful if we would be the first

 1             to come up with a cancer free cigarette.  But the
 2             second part portrays the true motive, what we
 3             could do to the competition.  Not what we could
 4             do to save lives.  Not what we could do to stop
 5             the horror and suffering of cancer death, one of
 6             the worst you can imagine.  Man, we could make
 7             more money.
 8                   The next one says, "Suppose everyone smoked
 9             just one cigarette less a day, that would be
10             maybe 40 billion a year."
11                   They made a decision that day.  It's
12             reported on the very next page, bottom paragraph.
13             This is Hill & Knowlton's charge from R.J.
14             Reynolds, Philip Morris and the other companies
15             that were there.
16                   "There is only one problem, confidence and
17             how to establish it; public assurance and how to
18             create it, and then perhaps a long interim when
19             scientific doubts must remain, and most important
20             how to free millions of the Americans from the
21             guilty fear that is going to arise deep in their
22             biological depths regardless of any pooh-poohing
23             logic every time they light a cigarette.  No
24             resort to mere logic ever cured panic, whether on
25             Madison Avenue, Main Street or in a

 1             psychologist's office, and no mere recitation of
 2             arguments pro, or ignoring of arguments con, or
 3             careful balancing of the two together is going to
 4             deal with such fear now.  That, gentlemen, is the
 5             nature of an unexampled challenge to this
 6             office."
 7                   It's a challenge that they took on.  It's a
 8             challenge that they continued all the way up
 9             through 1998, over 45 years of denial.
10                   They hid all the knowledge that they had
11             over and over again.  They made public statements
12             that were completely contrary to the information
13             that they had in their own files showed and they
14             did it over and over and over and over again.
15                   They did it first through TIRC, but very
16             quickly it became the Center for Tobacco
17             Research, I lose track sometimes.  The important
18             one is the Tobacco Institute.
19                   The Tobacco Institute was formed and the
20             video clips you've seen and I'm about to show you
21             in a moment all came from the Tobacco Institute.
22             The Tobacco Institute acts as the official
23             spokesman for the industry, always reflecting
24             official strategy positions agreed upon by all
25             members.

 1                   You remember I showed some of those clips
 2             to Dr. Figlar and I asked him, were those RJR's 3             positions?  He said, yes, it's my understanding
 4             that each of these statements had to be approved
 5             by R.J. Reynolds.
 6                   So who was the Tobacco Institute?  It was
 7             R.J. Reynolds.  It was Philip Morris.  It was
 8             Lorillard.  It was all of the manufacturers who
 9             contributed to it, who controlled it and it was
10             the very top of each organization.  The executive
11             committee members over time included the
12             presidents, vice presidents, board of directors,
13             CEOs of all the major corporations, including
14             R.J. Reynolds.
15                   A.H. Galloway, Bowman Gray, Jr., who you
16             heard from Dr. Figlar, Ed Horrigan, Gerald Long,
17             Collin Stokes, all of them over time served in
18             the very top levels of TI.
19                   And what was TI doing during that time?
20             Publicly TIRC, predecessor of CTR and TI, issued
21             a Frank Statement.  They're pledging aid and
22             assistance to the research efforts into all
23             phases of tobacco and health.  They're forming
24             the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and
25             they're putting up scientists of impeachable

 1             integrity and national repute.
 2                   What was going on privately?  Next slide,
 3             please.  The TIRC was conceived as a public
 4             relations gesture and it has functioned as a
 5             public relations gesture.  Another document,
 6             these are all in evidence that you can see.
 7             They're either from R.J. Reynolds or their fellow
 8             members who joined into that group, joined into
 9             that agreement.  "Let's say that we're interested
10             in the evidence which we believe denies the
11             allegation that cigarette smoking causes
12             disease."
13                   Next slide, please.  CTR began an
14             organization called Tobacco Industry Research
15             Council.  It was set up as an industry shield in
16             1954.  "It has always been a holding strategy
17             consisting of creating doubt about the health
18             charge without actually denying it." Exactly what
19             you saw in Hill & Knowlton's document.
20                   Privately we know some of the things that
21             R.J. Reynolds put out.  We have publicly again
22             TIRC in 1955.  It would be made public, speaking
23             of anything they found, any hazards in
24             cigarettes, it would be made public immediately
25             and just as broadly as we could make it and

 1             efforts would be taken to attempt to remove it.
 2             We can't possibly eliminate an agent that hasn't
 3             yet been identified.
 4                   We have Claude Teague in 1953 pointing out
 5             the carcinogens, labeling the carcinogens, saying
 6             looking at those other studies, indicating that
 7             they know that cigarettes are causing cancer.
 8                   But it continued.  Next slide.  1964, same
 9             year the Surgeon General's report came out.  "If
10             there are bad elements, we hope we can find them
11             and if they're found, they will be removed.  But
12             at this point, we don't know."  1964.
13                   Privately, the five PAHs have been isolated 14             and identified in cigarette smoke condensate from
15             Camel blend tobacco.  They knew not only tobacco
16             in general had carcinogens, R.J. Reynolds knew
17             that Camel had carcinogens.  "We consider the
18             zero level of PAHs impossible to achieve."
19             Publicly they're saying there's nothing bad.  And
20             if there is something bad.  Privately, they know
21             that carcinogens are there and they know they
22             can't remove them.
23                   Next slide, please.  Publicly in 1984,
24             "Science does not know what role, if any, smoking
25             may play in production of disease.  Only through

 1             much more research can cases and mechanisms be
 2             established and cigarette controversy resolved."
 3             While privately, the company is studying in
 4             detail the composition of cigarette smoke.  Much
 5             data remains unpublished because they're
 6             concerned with carcinogenic and co-carcinogenic
 7             compounds.
 8                   Ryan, could you play the video clips.
 9             You've going to see some clips you've already
10             seen.  Each of them came from high ranking
11             members of the Tobacco Institute and you've heard
12             from Dr. Figlar that R.J. Reynolds approved every
13             one of these statements.
14                   (Video clips played)
15                   MR. LOEHR:  Dr. Figlar, on the stand I
16             showed him some of those clips.  I gave him every
17             opportunity over and over again, that's not
18             right, is it, Dr. Figlar?  That shouldn't have
19             happened, should it?  Every time, no, no, that's
20             exactly what we did.  They're still doing it now.
21             They don't admit they did anything whatsoever
22             wrong.
23                   But what difference did all that make you
24             ask yourself.  You've heard us talk several times
25             about global warming and the divisiveness we have

 1             in society right now regarding whether that issue
 2             is real or not.  You heard polling testimony from
 3             Dr. Geer for the defendants saying that back
 4             during this time period, 90 percent -- back in
 5             the early '50s, 90 percent had heard or read
 6             something about the fact that cigarettes might be
 7             harmful, might cause cancer.
 8                   He said that's an unbelievable number until
 9             cross-examination when he found out that
10             99 percent had heard or read something about
11             UFOs.  But then in that poll when they were
12             asked, what harm do you associate with
13             cigarettes, 1954 after the mouse painting
14             studies, after the epidemiological studies, after
15             the front page news, after the Reader's Digest,
16             what harm do you associate with it?  Seven
17             percent of the 70 percent had heard or read
18             something, 7 percent of the 70 said lung cancer.
19             That's 4.9 percent.  That was the question that
20             Dr. Geer said, you can't pay any attention to
21             that.  That's not a good question.
22                   Actually it's probably the best question to
23             ask.  Sure, everyone had heard or read something,
24             but what did they think in 1954 and why did they 25             think that?

 1                   Why did it matter to Charles Gray?  Because
 2             back in 1953 when all this was going on, he was
 3             18 years old.  He had just gotten to the point
 4             that he was becoming more heavily addicted, maybe
 5             entered that circle at the age of 15 or 16, but
 6             look at all those factors, how long do you smoke,
 7             how heavily do you smoke, for how long have you
 8             smoked that way?  The DSM-IV said pack years were
 9             important in whether you relapse or not.  How
10             much easier would it have been to break out of
11             that addiction cycle if everyone had come clean
12             in the early '50s?
13                   I used global warming as an example because
14             we know what happens when there's a controversy.
15             We know what happens when the sides line up and
16             everybody starts going at it.  When there's a
17             whole lot that suggests that we're destroying
18             this planet with our carbon emissions and then
19             there's a whole other group of people that say
20             we're not doing anything.  If there's any warming
21             at all, it's all natural.  They both look at each
22             other and say that's full of bull, that's full of
23             bull.
24                   You heard from a very colorful witness in
25             this case, John Gray, Charles Gray's brother.

 1             What did you think about all those warnings?
 2             That was a bunch of bull.  What was the only
 3             voice saying that?  What was the only place
 4             anybody could get that information back in the
 5             1950s?  You know the answer.  It came directly
 6             from the industry.  It came from R.J. Reynolds
 7             and the trade groups they put together, the TIRC,
 8             the Tobacco Institute.  They kept it up for 40
 9             years.
10                   Did it make a difference to Charles Gray?
11             The only way to look at it is did it make a
12             difference to America?  If it didn't matter to
13             Charles Gray, it didn't matter to anyone.  This
14             is a young man who started smoking Camel, the
15             most heavily advertised cigarette of its time and
16             the most popular.  What did he do then?  He
17             switched to Winston.
18                   You've seen all the information about
19             Winston, their advertisements.  They became the
20             most heavily advertised around.  He followed the
21             trends.  He did exactly what R.J. Reynolds wanted
22             him to do, just as millions and millions and
23             millions of other Americans did.
24                   If we could go back to the Elmo for a
25             moment, please.

 1                   I would suggest the appropriate percentages
 2             here comparing the intentional targeting, the
 3             intentional misconduct of R.J. Reynolds, doing
 4             exactly what they knew they shouldn't have done,
 5             coming into this courtroom and telling you
 6             everything they did was consistent with the
 7             concern for public health, I would suggest the
 8             appropriate percentages are 80 percent on R.J.
 9             Reynolds and 20 percent on Charles Gray. 10                   Those matters are entirely up to you.  You
11             use your own judgment, your own common sense.
12             But you're comparing intentional conduct of
13             someone, one of the most powerful corporations in
14             the world with their own public relations firm,
15             their own advertising firms on Madison Avenue.
16             You saw the advertising, I'm not going to show it
17             all over again.  They overwhelmed America with
18             their message visually through the movies,
19             through TV, the I love Lucy Show, Beverly
20             Hillbillies -- by the way, none of which made it
21             on Dr. Parssinen's list, the historian, that he
22             got from Shook, Hardy, Bacon, the law firm that
23             served on the board of directors of the Tobacco
24             Institute.  And he told you, I didn't see any
25             problem with it.

 1                   He found 11 movies that said anything about
 2             smoking.  You didn't find all of the movies that
 3             glamorized it, you didn't find the TV ads, the
 4             radio ads, you didn't find any of that?  No.  He
 5             said that he thought Shook, Hardy and Bacon was
 6             just as reliable as the Library of Congress.
 7                   The next question on the verdict form that
 8             you'll have to answer is probably the most
 9             difficult question.  What is the total amount,
10             100 percent, of any damages sustained by Carolyn
11             Gray caused by the death of her husband Charles
12             Gray?
13                   You know, we talked a lot in this trial
14             about Charles Gray, but some of the things that
15             make the law so difficult are the things that we
16             don't talk about so much.  Yeah, he was a very
17             successful businessman, opened a number of
18             businesses successfully.  They'll have you
19             believe, I guess that's how he could have quit
20             smoking, somehow that fits together.  But right
21             by his side the whole time, when times were good,
22             and long before that when times were very, very
23             bad was Carolyn Gray.
24                   She followed that man all over the country
25             when he didn't even have a job.  They trusted

 1             each other.  They were together till death do
 2             them part.  In a way, I suppose, all too common,
 3             they're still together too.  Carolyn could never
 4             go out and try to date anyone else.  She was
 5             young, very young in the '50s, beautiful,
 6             intelligent, funny.  What are you going to do, go
 7             try to find another Charlie Gray?
 8                   They were partners in business.  They were
 9             partners in raising their children.  They were
10             partners in life.  I'll show you just a few
11             family photos that we put together.
12                   Carolyn said that when she pictures her
13             husband now it doesn't bring as much pain as it
14             used to, and sometimes it actually brings good
15             feelings to her.  She pictures him when he's in
16             his 50s, but not sick.  I think this is what
17             Carolyn sees.
18                   There is no exact number that we can tell
19             you.  There's no exact figure to put there.  You
20             use your best judgment.  We've talked about the 21             scales of justice and you have to place something
22             on one side of the scale, and somehow in some
23             crude fashion it tries to make up for her losses.
24                   We don't ask you for some record setting
25             verdict that's going to be in newspapers or

 1             anything else.  I would suggest $7 million for
 2             what she suffered in the past.  Whatever you feel
 3             is appropriate for the future.  The numbers are
 4             suggestions.  They're entirely up to you.
 5                   The last two issues on the verdict form
 6             deal with reliance.  Did what the tobacco
 7             industry did, did it have anything to do with
 8             Charles Gray?  And we've already talked about it.
 9             We have already talked about the fact that all of
10             this was occurring when he was young, all the
11             formation of TIRC and later TI, all of these
12             things were happening at a time when Charles Gray
13             had a chance, when whatever genetic
14             susceptibility he may have had to addiction
15             hadn't had a chance to completely take him over.
16                   What would have happened in the global
17             warming situation if everyone had joined hands on
18             that stage?  If the evidence was as compelling as
19             it was back then?  Now global warming is
20             everywhere.  Al Gore and Sarah Palin, George
21             Bush, Barack Obama, the presidents of GM, if
22             everybody was on that stage saying, we have a
23             tremendous problem and we have to do something
24             about it, how would our views of that be
25             different today?

 1                   The same way that the views of America
 2             would have been different in 1953 if that had
 3             happened.  Can you imagine how it would have been
 4             different and what it would have done to the
 5             lives of so many Americans?
 6                   They want you to conclude that it meant
 7             nothing, that it did nothing, because if it
 8             didn't mean something to Charlie Gray, it didn't
 9             mean anything to anyone.
10                   The last question on the verdict form deals
11             with punitive damages.  It asks you whether by
12             clear and convincing evidence you believe that
13             the conduct related to this cover-up, this 45
14             years of misconduct, whether you believe that
15             that conduct shows willful and wanton behavior.
16             Callous disregard, in other words, is it worse
17             than negligent?  Is it worse than accidental?
18                   When you hear that jury instruction, think
19             about the opposite of those words.  If it's not
20             callous, what was it?  Careful?  If it wasn't
21             intentional, what was it?  Accidental?
22                   Throughout everything you heard in this
23             trial, from all of those old documents, all the
24             way through to the testimony, did you ever see
25             anybody say, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a

 1             minute, we're killing people by the millions, we
 2             can't do this?  We've got to stop.  We've got to
 3             look at addiction.  We know what's causing this.
 4             It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it
 5             out.  People are addicted and that's why they're 6             smoking themselves to death.
 7                   Why didn't R.J. Reynolds ever look at ways
 8             to reduce the affinity of the nicotine receptors?
 9             Why didn't they look for ways to take the kick
10             out of nicotine instead of putting more kick in
11             the nicotine?
12                   Never once in any of those documents or
13             anything else that you've seen did you see any
14             concern for human life whatsoever.  It was all
15             just driven by profits.  Punitive damages are
16             appropriate in this case.
17                   You will now get a chance to hear R.J.
18             Reynolds' version of this case, and I would
19             suggest to you that their version is one that
20             comes from their witnesses, from Dr. Parssinen.
21                   THE COURT:  Your one hour cue, Mr. Loehr.
22                   MR. LOEHR:  Thank you.  From Dr. Parssinen
23             and Dr. Keefe.  They got their reliance materials
24             from Shook, Hardy and Bacon.  They relied upon
25             it.  Dr. Keefe didn't really rely upon them.  But

 1             in this world of R.J. Reynolds all you have to do
 2             to quit is just want to, all it takes is
 3             motivation to quit.  Addiction has nothing to do
 4             with it.  Addiction can't kill anybody.
 5                   In R.J. Reynolds' world they did nothing
 6             wrong.  They caused no harm to anyone.  The
 7             Tobacco Institute was a valid contribution to
 8             public health.
 9                   They will go through the evidence that
10             you've heard.  They will criticize Dr. Burns and
11             Dr. Benowitz and Dr. Cummings because of their
12             willingness to come into a courtroom like this
13             and testify.  They will pick and choose out of
14             the testimony that you heard to try to cobble
15             together a version of events that would allow you
16             to rule in their favor, and they will ask you to
17             exonerate them, to walk out of this courtroom
18             completely and totally blameless.
19                   Somehow that doesn't seem fair.


 9                   MR. LOEHR:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Very
10             briefly, I don't have a whole lot of time.  But
11             what you just heard basically is that R.J.
12             Reynolds did nothing wrong for all those years.
13             The one thing you heard that maybe they regret is
14             some of the language that Claude Teague used.
15             Maybe Claude Teague should have been a little
16             more careful in some of the things that he wrote.
17                   You know, if you compress 20, 30, 40 years
18             worth of intermittent warnings that basically
19             come sporadically after a big study, it makes it
20             look as if every single day people woke up in the
21             morning, walked out and picked up the newspaper
22             and went, oh, my God, cigarettes cause lung
23             cancer.
24                   Look at Reader's Digest.  Well, of course,
25             Charles Gray didn't have Reader's Digest.  It

 1             wasn't one that anyone ever said that he read,
 2             but the fact is when you put them all together,
 3             it can create this image.
 4                   They put up Time magazine, the slide said
 5             1952 to 1959.  Seven years and there's six or
 6             seven of them up there.  One per year, one
 7             article someplace in there.  It makes it look as
 8             if everybody knew, doesn't it? 9                   And then they showed us some very selected
10             testimony of some of the family members to
11             suggest that everybody knew, but you heard the
12             evidence.  You listened to it.  But since they
13             put that up, I need to put a few things up.
14                   Can I have the Elmo, please?  This is from
15             Betty Truitt, Mr. Gray's sister.  "Was it common
16             knowledge when you were growing up that smoking
17             was dangerous to your health?  No, it was not.
18             It was a social thing to do."
19                   Francis Driver, another sister, "But back
20             in that day I don't think people understood.
21             They did not have the information that is
22             available to people today about the hazards of
23             smoking."
24                   Jimmy Baggett, you saw some direct quotes
25             from Mr. Baggett, a brother-in-law.  "Did you

 1             ever talk to Mr. Gray about the potential hazards
 2             or risks of cigarette smoking?  We talked about
 3             it sometime.  What would you say?  Tell me the
 4             nature of the conversation.  One of us would say,
 5             I wish I could quit these things.  They make me
 6             feel bad and probably are going to give me
 7             cancer; they're gonna kill and all like that.
 8             Did you have those conversations in the early
 9             '80s when you came back to Pensacola?  No, not
10             that early on."
11                   This is the testimony you heard in the
12             courtroom, not the little selected pieces of it.
13                   His brother David Gray.  "Have you ever
14             heard that smoking is not harmful to your health?
15             Yes.  Where did you hear it?  Grew up on it.  Can
16             you think of someone who specifically told you
17             that, for example?  That was -- that was -- that
18             was just the environment."
19                   Same brother, David.  "And I think that Bob
20             had that mindset and at one time I know he had
21             the mindset that it didn't matter where we went
22             that they would always have a cure for it.  But
23             he truly believed for years that smoking was not
24             harmful."
25                   Now, where would they have gotten all of

 1             that information?  Where did that come from?
 2             This is why it mattered.  He kept saying why
 3             would we withhold?  My goodness, we didn't look
 4             at the carcinogens until other people already
 5             looked at them.  It was already in the press
 6             before we started doing our research on them.
 7             But they withheld the fact that they agreed.
 8             They withheld the fact that they knew.  They
 9             created a controversy.  They're the reason people
10             didn't believe it.  They're the reason that
11             people grew up thinking that cigarettes weren't
12             that harmful for them because they constantly
13             heard that.  It was constantly out there,
14             especially in the Deep South, especially in
15             Alabama.
16                   By the time he began discussing these
17             matters with his wife, you've heard the
18             testimony, when he got serious about this, when
19             they started having conversations, he had been 20             diagnosed with bladder cancer.  And at that point
21             in time, yeah, he knew the risks.  We never said
22             he didn't.  He got it slapped in his face and he
23             tried awfully hard to quit.
24                   They kept saying what did this have to do
25             with Charles Gray?  All of that advertising, I

 1             guess it was for nothing.  I guess nobody paid
 2             any attention except, let's see Camel was their
 3             most heavily advertised brand and that's what he
 4             started smoking and then Winston became the most
 5             heavily advertised brand and that's what he ended
 6             up smoking his entire life.
 7                   They said it had a filter that would help
 8             with the health problems.  It didn't.  In fact,
 9             they had a document that they looked at.  Could
10             we see that slide?
11                   You looked at this during our case.  This
12             was a strategic research report from 1984 from
13             R.J. Reynolds, but it was looking back.  How did
14             we capture the youth market in the past?  The
15             young adult smokers are the key factor for RJR.
16             Young adult smokers are the only source for
17             replacement smokers.  That's a charming term,
18             isn't it?
19                   People die.  Some of them manage to quit.
20             Replacement smokers.  This is a significant
21             growth opportunity.  Winston, the hit of the '50s
22             and '60s.  Advertising dollars were a key
23             advantage for Winston.  Younger adult and older
24             smokers alike responded promptly to Winston's
25             positive proposition.

 1                   Can we see the next slide, please?  One of
 2             the advertisements they used for Winston talked
 3             about the Winston secret.  The filter blend,
 4             ahead of the filter, that's the Winston secret.
 5             What's the secret?  What did they withhold?
 6                   From their own documents, the polycyclic
 7             aromatic hydrocarbon content of the smoke from
 8             Winston cigarettes was two and a half times that
 9             of the smoke from Camel cigarettes.
10                   Those are the carcinogens.  Their filter,
11             their highly effective, pure white filter, two
12             and a half times the amount of carcinogens in the
13             cigarettes he was smoking.  What did it have to
14             do with Charles Gray?  It had everything to do
15             with Charles Gray.
16                   It's a voice, it's an enabling voice.  What
17             would it be like if Bacardi started doing public
18             announcements, they formed an organization, let's
19             call it the alcohol investigation committee, and
20             they started issuing statements saying, this
21             whole thing about alcoholism, don't listen to it.
22             Alcohol is not addictive.  People don't get
23             dependent on it.  It's your right to drink.
24             Drink all you want.
25                   If they attacked every single message from

 1             the public health community trying to help people
 2             stop drinking, trying to help alcoholics stop and
 3             then what would they say?  Well, you can't prove
 4             it did anything.  You can't prove that that's why 5             these alcoholics started drinking because after
 6             all, everybody knows once a person who is
 7             addicted -- once they stop for a while, they're
 8             not addicted anymore, are they?
 9                   An alcoholic who goes on the wagon for some
10             time, falls back off the wagon.  Well, it can't
11             be because he's an alcoholic, can it?  Because
12             that's not how addiction works.
13                   They told you that because Charles Gray
14             quit for a year and then relapsed, it couldn't
15             possibly have to do with his addiction.  And
16             Mr. Kaczynski told you over and over again those
17             neural, those receptors, they go back to normal.
18                   Dr. Benowitz told you in no uncertain terms
19             about neuroplasticity, about how it can last a
20             lifetime, about how it's permanent; and their own
21             expert, Dr. Keefe, that was the conversation I
22             was having with him about PET scans, that you can
23             actually see that on PET scans.  It doesn't go
24             away.
25                   It's why once you're an alcoholic, you're

 1             always an alcoholic.  It's why once you're
 2             addicted to cigarettes, you're always addicted.
 3                   How responsible do you think it would be to
 4             encourage someone who has finally broken out of a
 5             cigarette habit, here, it's the Super Bowl,
 6             Sunday afternoon?  Smoke a few, you're not
 7             addicted anymore.  What the heck?
 8                   You know, there's a lot of criticism about
 9             the expert witnesses we put on the stand.  Some
10             of it related to the fact that they were not in
11             R.J. Reynolds words dispassionate.  Yeah, guilty
12             as charged.  How in the heck could those men be
13             dispassionate?  They've sat their entire careers
14             and watched people die from this addiction.  A
15             pulmonologist, a cardiologist and a man who works
16             in a cancer institute trying to help people stop
17             smoking.
18                   And then they discover in the late '90s
19             when finally it gets bludgeoned out of this
20             industry, they find out all the secrets they held
21             all those years.  They find out what they were
22             doing.  They find out what they knew all along,
23             that there never was a controversy.
24                   Remember Dr. Burns' chart where he showed
25             that cigarettes were going through the roof, and

 1             then they come down a little bit in 1953.  Then
 2             what happens?  Oh, we've got new filters, don't
 3             worry about it.  Boom, it goes up even though the
 4             cigarettes have more carcinogens and more
 5             nicotine than they started with.  It comes down a
 6             little bit again after 1964.  Boom, it starts
 7             going back up.  Low tar, low nicotine.  There's
 8             always an answer.  There's always a way.  There's
 9             always a voice from this industry to help people
10             keep smoking.
11                   You know, you heard some stuff about how
12             they're not responsible for anything from Philip
13             Morris, but I want you to listen very carefully
14             when the Court instructs you regarding the
15             findings in this case because what you're going 16             to find out is that Philip Morris and the other
17             manufacturers were, in fact, part of an
18             agreement.  And if you find that Charles Gray was
19             a class member, that they were all part of an
20             agreement to do this, and you've seen the
21             agreement, and that because of that anything they
22             did in furtherance of that agreement is R.J.
23             Reynolds' fault just as much as Philip Morris'
24             fault.  They were all doing it together.  They
25             were all approving it from the very top to the

 1             very bottom of the comments.
 2                   You were told that if you look at the
 3             Philip Morris of today, you should look at the
 4             Premier and you should look at the Eclipse.  Can
 5             we see -- this is the memo from Claude Teague
 6             that I handed to Dr. Figlar right at the end of
 7             his testimony.  Did you wonder what in the world
 8             was going on in this courtroom?  What in the
 9             world was going on when that man wouldn't agree
10             with me that putting a little blast of menthol on
11             a filter so somebody could squeeze it and get a
12             blast of flavor, he wouldn't agree that was a
13             novelty?  It took five, six, seven questions and
14             I'm not sure he ever agreed.  I think I got him
15             to admit it was novel.
16                   Why wouldn't he agree with it?  Because
17             Claude Teague made a blueprint, we're going after
18             the youth market.  Like you saw earlier, they
19             looked at in 1984, looking back to the past.
20             Claude Teague had a wonderful idea and the idea
21             was we need to come up with something.  Most of
22             the product specifications -- if we could go to
23             Page 11.
24                   Most of the product specifications defined
25             are achievable with present technology.  Those

 1             which require new technology would appear to be
 2             control of irritancy and related mouth feel
 3             factors to produce a bland smoke and creation of
 4             some useful demonstrable novelty in filter,
 5             mouthpiece, package or the other aspects of the
 6             product system.
 7                   Earlier he talked about the name --
 8                   THE COURT:  Two minutes, Mr. Loehr.
 9                   MR. LOEHR:  The name has double meaning, a
10             meaning in regular society and one that might be
11             a little different in the youth society.
12                   This is the Philip Morris of the year 2010.
13             Just as much as the Eclipse, just as much as the
14             Premier.  This is it.  Old habits die hard.
15             89 percent of their users begin smoking before
16             the age of 18, and I gave him every opportunity,
17             are you doing anything to try to reduce the
18             addictiveness?  Have you tried to lower the
19             binding affinity of the nicotine receptors?  How
20             would we do that?  We'll never know if you don't
21             look.  Have you done anything to reduce the
22             nicotine?  No.
23                   Just like they said so long ago.  It's a
24             good thing for us it's a habit people can't kick.
25             Just like Claude Teague said, happily for us it's
3128 1             addictive.
 2                   You know, the suggestion that I suppose
 3             since Carolyn Gray brought this lawsuit, the
 4             suggestion that she made a victim of her husband.
 5             You know what?  There's things in a courtroom
 6             that really ought to be off limits and that's one
 7             of them.  To accuse this woman of making a victim
 8             of her husband.  The only man she ever loved.
 9             The man she spent her whole life with.
10                   I guess he was supposed to run out and file
11             a lawsuit while he was dying of cancer.  He had a
12             few other things on his mind and when you go back
13             in that jury room and you think about everything
14             that happened in this trial, I want one thing to
15             stay in your mind.
16                   I want you to picture Carolyn Gray on her
17             way back to Branson, Missouri after she buried
18             the only man she ever loved, going back to face
19             what she was facing in Branson, the restaurant
20             half built, loans half put together, the entire
21             family depending upon her, and I want it to ring
22             in your ears that R.J. Reynolds tells you that
23             she made a victim out of Charles Gray.
24                   Thank you.
