23              MR. KACZYNSKI:  May it please the Court, Counsel,
24        Mrs. Gray, Ladies and Gentlemen. 25              Last Friday afternoon you returned a verdict

 1        against R.J. Reynolds and found punitive damages
 2        appropriate.  I'm here to tell you that my client took
 3        your verdict very seriously, takes this stage of the
 4        proceedings very seriously.
 5              So we put Dr. Figlar on the stand, and we talked
 6        a little bit about the activities -- how things have
 7        changed at Reynolds, how the activities that you saw
 8        last week -- and incidentally, the reason we didn't go
 9        through addressing the activities you saw the last two
10        weeks is because you saw them the last two weeks.  He
11        testified last week.
12              Last week and the week before was about the past.
13        Largely what we're here to talk about today is about
14        the future.  And the future tells us that where we're
15        at with R.J. Reynolds is that almost everything you saw
16        up on the screen that you might have found fault with
17        cannot happen again, and I'm going to go through them
18        to show you how.
19              See, one of the difficulties we had from Friday
20        to today is, we couldn't talk to you.  We couldn't ask
21        you what particularly was it that you heard over the
22        last couple of weeks that troubled you so that you
23        checked that punitive damages were appropriate.  What
24        part of it or maybe parts of it troubled you so that we
25        could address them specifically.  So we're going to

 1        discuss a number of areas.  We discussed a number of
 2        areas.
 3              I understand how, when someone like Dr. Figlar,
 4        who's an employee of the tobacco company, gets on the
 5        witness stand and talks about things that are in
 6        progress or things that have happened in the past, that
 7        people have a certain amount of skepticism about that,
 8        and I think it's fair to say that companies have maybe
 9        earned some of that skepticism.  Skepticism and whatnot
10        becomes cynicism.
11              When he talks about how things have changed and
12        they're attempting to cooperate with the public health
13        authorities, when they've changed their Web site and
14        they've changed their way of doing business, people
15        ought to listen.  People ought to listen to decide that
16        a further deterrent might just not be necessary.
17              The two purposes you've heard and will hear of
18        punitive damages are punishment is one, but deterrence
19        is the other.  One's about the past.  One's about the
20        future.
21              Whether you need to send a message or not to R.J.
22        Reynolds is about the future.  What is the company
23        doing now that's different from what it's done before?
24        I'm going to talk about a few of those things.  I'm
25        going to do them in reverse order, and I'm going start

 1        with deterrence.
 2              Over the last couple of weeks you saw evidence
 3        that the plaintiffs characterized as concealment,
 4        beginning with the 1953 Claude Teague memo and moving
 5        forward.
 6              We've heard over and over again this stuff wasn't
 7        disclosed, that these memos only came out because of
 8        litigation, and that they never intended to see the
 9        light of day.  Well, that can never happen again. 10              You heard from Dr. Cummings, back on January 26
11        when he testified about where he got all his documents
12        from, who had access to them, one of the places he told
13        you he had access to them was from websites each of the
14        companies set up on account of a settlement
15        agreement -- and I use the word "agreement" because we
16        talked about they were forced to do it by litigation.
17        Well, yes, litigation got the negotiations started, but
18        in the end it was an agreement.  Both sides gave
19        something.
20              In this instance, one of the things that all the
21        tobacco companies gave is an agreement to post all
22        their company documents on a public Web site, and this
23        is Reynolds' -- rjrt.com.
24              What's on it?  You have access to all Reynolds
25        documents, Reynolds' positions on smoking and health

 1        issues.  And on the Reynolds Web site, the tobacco
 2        company Web site, you could link to the surgeon general
 3        Web site and the Web site of other public health
 4        authorities, like the cancer society -- National Cancer
 5        Institute and others to find out what they have to say
 6        about smoking and health issues.
 7              So when you deliver your verdict and are released
 8        by Judge Terrell from your obligation not to look at
 9        outside sources, when that's done and you're free to do
10        that, log onto www.rjrt.com, and you can read
11        everything Claude Teague wrote.
12              MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, I'll object.  All of
13        R.J. Reynolds documents are not contained on that Web
14        site.  That is a misrepresentation.
15              THE COURT:  If the jury will step out a moment,
16        please.
17              (Jury exited the courtroom.)
18              THE COURT:  The jury is out.
19              MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, there are two grounds
20        for our objection, and I apologize for speaking on the
21        objection.
22              Number one, Mr. Kaczynski said all of R.J.
23        Reynolds documents are there, and that's not true.
24        They have a litigation-only Web site, as they well
25        know.

 1              Number two, this suggests to the jury that
 2        they'll get all the rest of the facts -- that they'll
 3        get the rest of the picture after they've deliberated,
 4        and I think that's improper.  Their verdict should be
 5        based on the evidence they saw in this courtroom.
 6              MR. KACZYNSKI:  Your Honor, as to the latter I,
 7        quite frankly, don't know what he's talking about.
 8              I'm basically saying that if you want to go see
 9        what's been going on at R.J. Reynolds, you can do it.
10              As to the first, documents have been placed on
11        the Web site.  I certainly don't think it's appropriate
12        to make an objection accusing me of misrepresentation
13        in front of the jury.
14              MR. SCHULTZ:  It's about as inappropriate as
15        making one, Your Honor.
16              THE COURT:  Well, gentlemen, this has been a
17        civil trial, and it's not going to digress now.
18              I think the distinction between the litigation
19        section and other sections is, arguably, a distinction
20        without a difference, but let's limit ourselves to 21        issues here.  The objection is overruled.  Call the
22        jurors if they're ready, please.
23              (Jury entered the courtroom.)
24              COURT SECURITY:  The jury's in the box.
25              THE COURT:  Thank you.  Mr. Kaczynski, please

 1        continue.
 2              MR. KACZYNSKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Picking
 3        up where I left off, you can log onto rjrt.com and read
 4        about Claude Teague.
 5              For that matter, as I said, each tobacco
 6        defendant has a Web site required by the MSA.  You
 7        could log onto Philip Morris' Web site and read all
 8        about those individuals you saw up in those videos over
 9        the last couple of weeks.  So concealment is over.
10              Maybe you were troubled by Reynolds' positions on
11        smoking and health over the years.  First, it hadn't
12        been proven that it's a risk factor, and finally to
13        where they are today.
14              Well, if you log onto rjrt.com -- that's not
15        readable.  If you log onto rjrt.com, you read,
16        cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable
17        deaths in the United States.  Cigarette smoking
18        significantly increases the risk of lung cancer, heart
19        disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other
20        serious diseases and adverse health conditions.  No
21        tobacco product has been shown to be safe and without
22        risks, and quitting tobacco use significantly reduces
23        the risk for serious diseases, no equivocation there.
24        In another part you'll see the admission that smoking
25        is addictive.

 1              By the way, in this case from day one -- from day
 2        one you were told that whether Mr. Gray's smoking
 3        caused his lung cancer was not going to be an issue in
 4        this case.  We admitted that it was.
 5              From day one you were told that whether Mr. Gray
 6        was addicted to cigarettes was not going to be an issue
 7        in this case.  From day one we admitted that it was.
 8              On the same Web site, as I said, you're going to
 9        find links to the surgeon general, surgeon general
10        reports, National Cancer Institute, American Cancer
11        Society, American Heart Association.
12              And Reynolds believes that individuals should
13        rely on these sources and other public health sources
14        for advice about smoking and health.
15              If you never thought you'd see the day where a
16        tobacco company is saying, please, please rely on the
17        surgeon general, well that day has come, and they'll
18        never go back.
19              You want to know what goes into R.J. Reynolds'
20        cigarettes?  The Web site tells you.  They have their
21        ingredients posted on there -- voluntarily posted on
22        there, not as a result of a lawsuit, not a result as --
23        I thought I heard the word a few times over the past
24        couple of weeks -- Reynolds being bludgeoned into it.
25        This is voluntary.

 1              If you -- you can do it by brand, too.  Want to
 2        know what's in a Winston?  Well, if you could read
 3        that, you'd find out that Winstons are additive-free.
 4        There are no additives in Winston.
 5              Maybe you were troubled about the companies  6        joining together to form CTR or TI.  You saw the charts
 7        of those shadowy figures over and over again who met in
 8        the executive committees and other committees.  Well,
 9        that cannot happen again.
10              Next one, please.  That's out.  CTR is gone, and
11        it has been as a result of the same settlement
12        agreement since 1998.  The Tobacco Institute is gone,
13        and it has been since 1998.  All those executives you
14        saw from the '50s, the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, all
15        those people, they're all gone.
16              Claude Teague is gone.  The executives who
17        testified in front of the congressional committee and
18        quibbled about whether smoking could cause disease and
19        whether smoking is addictive, they're gone.
20              Claude Teague is gone.  Frank Colby is gone.
21        Murray Senkus is gone.  Those lawyers you saw meddling
22        in R&D affairs, they're gone, too.
23              Since the merger with Brown and Williamson in
24        2004, we have a new company -- literally a new company
25        with the new management.

 1              You saw the first two CEOs of the new R.J.
 2        Reynolds.  And if you even look at them, you'll see
 3        that they're different than the people you saw in the
 4        grainy videos and the sinister posters that you saw for
 5        the last two weeks.  This is the new face of Reynolds.
 6              We brought Dr. Figlar back to talk about the new
 7        R&D department at Reynolds.  We brought him back to
 8        fill in a little detail on product initiatives, about
 9        Premier, about Eclipse, about Snus, and about
10        Targacept.
11              One of the things that might have bothered you,
12        you saw a lot of ideas batted around, particularly in
13        the '70s and the '80s.  Now, nobody testified any of
14        these ideas went anywhere.
15              You heard Dr. Cummings.  He found some documents
16        that suggested a new brand for youth.  Did you see any
17        evidence it went anywhere, Dr. Cummings?  No.  None of
18        these ideas went anywhere.
19              The idea of trying to lower tar and keep a
20        nicotine level so that people who are going to smoke
21        would get lower levels of toxic carcinogens, they
22        investigated it, but it never went anywhere.
23              Maybe you were concerned about the fact that
24        there's no memo saying, no, don't do this, no, this is
25        a stupid idea or, no, you're fired.

 1              Well, what's the guiding philosophy of the R&D
 2        department of the 21st century?  It's all harm
 3        reduction and product development.  Basically what that
 4        sums up in three phrases is, don't make it worse, make
 5        it better where you can, and encourage the use of
 6        lower-risk products.
 7              Now, one of the arguments that you've had from
 8        lawyers over the course of the last couple weeks, you
 9        heard that you never saw a Reynolds document that took
10        health into account.  Well, you're seeing it now.
11        Don't make it worse, make it better where you can, and
12        encourage the use of lower-risk products -- not for
13        market share, not for profits, but for health and for
14        safety.
15              It's been argued that Reynolds should have opened
16        an R&D department earlier than 1952.  The mouse skin 17        paintings in Argentina in the '30s and '40s should have
18        been a wake-up call.  Whether they should have been or
19        not, that was then.
20              What kind of product testing is going on in
21        Reynolds labs today?  State of the art.  Test tube
22        studies, animal studies, studies with smokers,
23        genotoxicity, inhalation.  You name it, they do that
24        with their products.
25              Next, chemistry testing, biological toxicology

 1        testing, studies with smokers, independent scientific
 2        verification, have the outside labs verify what the
 3        inside labs say.
 4              This is not about profits.  This is not about
 5        market share.  This is about health, and this is about
 6        safety.
 7              Last week you heard about Premier.  Premier, I'll
 8        remind you, was something that was begun back in -- way
 9        back in 1981, way back deep in the era of Claude
10        Teague.
11              Premier went out on the market in 1988.  It went
12        on the market with reductions like 99 percent in
13        benzoapyrene.  Almost all of it out because it was a
14        technology that heated rather than burned tobacco -- a
15        no-tar cigarette, practically.  This is all about
16        health and safety, all the carcinogens brought down to
17        close to zero.
18              You heard today -- was this welcomed by the
19        public health community?  Does the surgeon general say
20        this is a definite step forward in cancer prevention?
21              No.  You saw the letter.  Concern that any safer
22        cigarette -- that this safer cigarette might keep
23        people smoking, might cause people to relapse or cause
24        people to smoke.
25              Well, folks, that's going to be true with any

 1        safer cigarette, and this was one that didn't succeed
 2        in the marketplace.  Grant you, it tasted funny and was
 3        hard to light, but you can't look at all those numbers
 4        and not conclude that this was a good idea that should
 5        have been followed up on.  This was hounded from the
 6        market.
 7              On this side of Atlantic, you saw letters like
 8        that from the surgeon general.  On the other side of
 9        Atlantic, you saw letters like this from Dr. Michael
10        Russell, who said Premier had a tremendous potential
11        for low-risk, long-term nicotine use.  The response to
12        it in your country was political and irrational.  I
13        write because, in my view, it would be very sad if you
14        were to abandon further development of such a
15        potentially valuable product.
16              Reynolds at this point, one would think, would
17        have a right to wonder -- and I'll clean this up for
18        court -- if they were darned if they did and darned if
19        they didn't.
20              So did they give up on Premier?  No.  Did they
21        let Dr. Russell down?  No.
22              Next clips.  Again, remarkable reductions in
23        harmful smoke constituents.  You saw the test results.
24              Next.  Incredible reductions in tumorgenicity on
25        animals and skin painting tests, both per animal and

 1        total tumors.  This is all about health and safety.  2              It was put on the market in 1986 -- excuse me --
 3        1996, and they didn't leave it there.  They continued
 4        to work on it to make it better, to try to get more
 5        people to smoke this less-hazardous product.
 6              You heard in the first phase of the trial, for
 7        example, that Dr. Benowitz is one of the leading cancer
 8        or leading smoking and health experts in the world.
 9        What did he have to say right here in this courtroom?
10        Eclipse is likely to be less harmful than smoking
11        regular cigarettes with respect to cancer and lung
12        disease.  Is it perfect?  No, it's not perfect.  It
13        still has a risk of heart disease.  But should we make
14        the perfect the enemy of the good?
15              Eclipse was something that Dr. Benowitz and
16        others at this conference at Duke thought was a good
17        idea.  This good idea is still on the market.  This
18        good idea is for sale right here in Florida.
19              As you heard today, Reynolds loses money on every
20        pack of Eclipse, so it can't be about profits.  They
21        have a very small market share, so it can't be about
22        market share.
23              Once again, in the new RJR, Reynolds believes in
24        its potential, and Eclipse is on the market because of
25        its potential for health and its potential for safety.

 1              And then there's Snus.  Reynolds, on its Web
 2        site, advises smokers to quit.  Now, again, did you
 3        ever think you'd see this?  A tobacco company advising
 4        smokers concerned about their health to quit.
 5              But if you don't want to quit or if you're one of
 6        those people who think they can't quit, they say,
 7        adults who continue to use tobacco products should
 8        consider the reductions of risks for serious diseases
 9        associated with moving from cigarettes to the use of
10        smoke-free products or nicotine products, and it makes
11        Snus available, as we said, the Swedish word for snuff.
12        It's a smokeless product.
13              Now, think what you will about it.  The
14        epidemiology, the statistics -- the same kind of
15        science that showed that cigarette smokers had a much
16        higher risk of lung cancer than nonsmokers -- shows
17        that people who use Snus have a much lower risk of
18        disease than people who smoke cigarettes.  You saw the
19        studies from Sweden.
20              And, quite frankly, this was the choice that was
21        made by John Gray, remember?  John Gray, way back when,
22        got a bad, bad report from his doctor, and he testified
23        to save his life he stopped smoking cigarettes and
24        dipped snuff.  I mean, he still dips snuff, and he's
25        still with us.  And he, by making the change, did in

 1        fact save his life.  So it's not just a theory.  You
 2        saw it here live in practice.
 3              This position about Snus, about smokeless
 4        products, which is, quit if you can, but if you don't,
 5        switch to a smokeless product, you saw here today is
 6        favored by two people who testified in that chair, Dr.
 7        Burns and Dr. Benowitz.
 8              Reynolds believes in this approach.  Reynolds
 9        communicates this approach to the public that migrating
10        to smoke-free products could achieve significant
11        reductions in healthcare.
12              Significant reductions in the harm associated 13        with the use of cigarettes can be achieved by providing
14        accurate information regarding the comparative risks of
15        tobacco products to adult tobacco consumers, thereby
16        encouraging smokers to migrate to the use of smoke-free
17        tobacco and nicotine products and by developing new
18        smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products and other
19        actions.
20              And with this, this is not something they're
21        doing off on their own.  As you heard, they have an
22        ongoing dialog with the public health authorities on
23        this topic.
24              You could argue that it's a ploy, that it's just
25        another way to get people using nicotine, but if that

 1        were true, would you find Dr. Burns favoring this
 2        approach?  Would you find Dr. Benowitz favoring this
 3        approach?  Common sense.
 4              And the last initiative that Reynolds began and
 5        then spun off into an independent company is Targacept,
 6        and this is a big deal.
 7              Scientists have suspected for years that nicotine
 8        might be used to treat diseases of the central nervous
 9        system like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.  Reynolds
10        joined in that research for three years from 1997 to
11        2000, and they found it promising.
12              They're a tobacco company, not a pharmaceutical
13        company, so they spun it off into Targacept.  It's run
14        by former Reynolds R&D scientists, and it's doing
15        valuable research.  It's how nicotine, which, for the
16        last couple weeks has been batted around here like a
17        bad word -- how nicotine can help treat destructive
18        diseases.
19              You heard in this courtroom that Dr. Benowitz
20        thinks it's valuable research.  He knows about
21        Targacept.  Would you agree with the bottom-line point,
22        Dr. Benowitz, that using nicotine-related research that
23        Reynolds did to try to develop therapeutic products
24        that interact with these nicotine receptors, is that
25        good research to be done?  I think it could be

 1        valuable, yes.  Targacept endorsed -- the concept
 2        endorsed by Dr. Benowitz.  So that's the Reynolds --
 3        the change to Reynolds R&D.
 4              I saved the discussion for punishment to last
 5        because inevitably that becomes about money.  But
 6        there's one thing, based on what you heard earlier from
 7        Mr. Schultz -- I want to harken back to something we
 8        talked about in opening and something you saw through
 9        some of the witnesses on the stand.
10              It rewrites history to suspect that nicotine was
11        the key -- was the top concern of everybody throughout
12        the '50s and the '60s and '70s and '80s.  It was not.
13        You heard from the earliest beginnings of the smoking
14        and health controversy, when the first studies came out
15        in the 1950s that tar was immediately labeled as the
16        bad actor, and tar was attacked, and tar was to be
17        reduced at all costs.
18              You saw how Dr. Wynder said a 40 percent
19        reduction in tar would be a positive thing in public
20        health.  Everyone, the tobacco companies, the public
21        health agencies, everyone, was encouraging the
22        companies to figure out a way to reduce tar.
23              So if you saw a lot of documents that talked 24        about tar, tar, tar, methods of ways to reduce tar, but
25        not talking about nicotine.  It's because that was the

 1        subject of the day.  And to the extent nicotine was
 2        discussed, it was discussed tangentially.  Why?
 3        Because the goal was to lower tar.
 4              You even saw the series of documents -- series of
 5        recommendations from the public health community to
 6        lower tar as much as you can.  Get the cancer-causing
 7        thing as low as you can, but maintain nicotine.
 8              Now, that sounds an awful lot like you're doing
 9        it to keep people addicted, but it wasn't.  It was to
10        help people continue to smoke, but smoke lower-tar
11        products.  So if you didn't see a lot about nicotine,
12        it's because nicotine wasn't the concern in the 1950s,
13        '60s, '70s and '80s as it is today, and certainly not
14        as much as it's been in this courtroom.
15              So when we get to punishment, this issue is about
16        how much more money you're going to award Mrs. Gray.
17        So let's talk about that.
18              From time to time during the course of this trial
19        you heard about profits.  So I guess my starting point
20        is, you can't punish Reynolds for making profits.
21        Cigarettes are a lawful product, lawful to manufacture,
22        lawful to sell, and lawful to turn a profit on their
23        sale.
24              Now, maybe it's the first time you've heard, but
25        the profit on the sale of cigarettes today is 33 cents

 1        per pack -- 33 cents.  That's what the company makes
 2        per pack.
 3              Judge Terrell will instruct you to consider
 4        mitigating evidence.  This is the instruction.  You
 5        should take into consideration any mitigating evidence.
 6        Mitigating evidence is evidence which may demonstrate
 7        that there is no need for punitive damages or that a
 8        reduced amount of punitive damages should be imposed
 9        against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
10              When you go back to deliberate, I'd ask for you
11        to take into your mitigation that Reynolds is a changed
12        company.
13              By the way, when you saw the number with net
14        worth, net worth, of course, is somewhat like
15        Mr. Schultz described.  It's not a pile of cash.  Net
16        worth includes all the assets of R.J. Reynolds,
17        buildings, plants, things like that, tangibles.  It's
18        not cash in the bank.
19              So what extra money should be awarded Mrs. Gray?
20        Mr. Schultz suggested $21 million and got that out of
21        his sea of green chart that he had up there.  I would
22        suggest that you pick a number not based on emotion or
23        some picture like that.  Obviously it's up to you.
24              Here's a thought.  In phase one plaintiff asked
25        for $7 million and asked that 80 percent fault be

 1        assigned to R.J. Reynolds.  You awarded $7 million, but
 2        assigned Reynolds 60 percent fault.
 3              If my math is right, the 20 percent that you did
 4        not agree with the plaintiffs on would be worth
 5        $1.4 million.  I would suggest that since the plaintiff
 6        picked the $7 million figure and the 80 percent
 7        liability, that you assign that 20 percent fault where
 8        you were different from what the plaintiff wanted --  9        assign that to R.J. Reynolds.  Award Mrs. Gray an
10        additional $1.4 million.  That would give her what she
11        originally asked for, an additional $1.4 million.
12              It's a rational number.  It's a reasonable
13        number.  It's their number, and it's a number that will
14        make her whole without a windfall.  No matter who you
15        are, whether you're R.J. Reynolds, Mrs. Gray, or
16        anybody else, $1.4 million is still a lot of money.
17              Now, punitive damages are available to punish and
18        deter future misconduct.  What you saw in the first
19        phase of this trial was the R.J. Reynolds of the 20th
20        century.  What you saw briefly here today -- too
21        briefly -- was the R.J. Reynolds of the 21st century,
22        the one with the Web site, the one with the scientific
23        testing, the one that cooperates with the public health
24        community, the one that advises people to quit, the one
25        that has links on its Web site to the National

 1        Institutes of Health and the surgeon general.
 2              That R.J. Reynolds understands that you will be
 3        just, but it's simply asking you to be fair.  Thank you
 4        very much.
