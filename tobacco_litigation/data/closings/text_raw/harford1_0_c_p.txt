MR. MIGLIORI:
Thank you very much.

On

who have been here for two weeks trying to bring
this case to you, thank you.

that's been raised by another court completely.

that question is simply:

your own eyes.
Look at the direct evidence that's
in this case and I think we'll get through the
question of whether Mr. Harford belongs in this
class with everyone else.
And if he does belong in this class with
everyone else, then we can answer the question is
there a compensation that he should be entitled to, And then is that amount of

Now, this won't be on the verdict form, but
I've put photographs next to the witnesses who came

very question.
Dr. Cummings was the first person up here and
he spoke to you at length in the beginning about
smoking behaviors, how doubt and controversy causes

reported in the FTC reports, causes people to not

to refute that.
This is an unrefuted question about
addiction.

industry maybe thought of it as being a specialized,
highly ritualized and stylized segment of the
pharmaceutical industry.
Tobacco products uniquely
contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a
variety of physiological effects.

says in essence a cigarette is a system for delivery 61
of nicotine to the smoker in an attractive, useful
form.

examining the available evidence, this report
concludes that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco
are addicting.

that causes addiction.

Two of the
Defendants did not.
You won't see in the instruction a definition
of addiction, but we brought one to you through our
experts.
The only definition
brought to you is, "Addiction is defined as a
chronic, relapsing brain disease that is
characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use,
despite harmful consequences."
that harmful consequences may result, but what
causes you to keep smoking is the nicotine, the need
for the nicotine, the compulsive need.
It contains an idea

showed you this and it probably didn't make as much 62

disease.
choice.
So
when people like Dr. Cummings talk to their patients
and they say you can do it, you just have to put
your mind to it, they're not saying it's that
simple, they're not saying it's a matter of turn it
on or turn it off, they're saying you have to start
with a need, with a desire, with an ability to fight
this thing because it's pharmacologic and it's
behavioral.
And in a
smoker of 35-plus years, you have to overcome a lot
because it's a behavior that's been learned and
memorized and part of his body physically and
behaviorally over decades.
You have to overcome a lot.
And, importantly, despite the 60 million that
defense counsel refers to of people who have quit,
only 3 to 5 percent of people who try to quit
successfully quit every year.
The fact that 60 million have quit, that means
people who start and start that don't have the same
duration, that means every type of smoker there is.
And by the way, that also means how many more are actually smoking.
Next.
So obviously the stories come out
through the different witnesses, the addiction is a
matter of medicine and nobody here is to refute it.
We have Mr. Harford's testimony about his need to
smoke and his inability to stop and his various
attempts.
We have Dr. Werner's three different
tools used to say that he's both severe and
addicted, and Dr. Burns' testimony about addiction

And you
don't have to infer that from records because we
brought the diagnosing physician here.
Dr. Scanlon -- when the judge talked to you
this morning about direct evidence, Dr. Scanlon
could not be any more direct.
When they had a
question about lung cancer, Dr. Scanlon was called
in to make the determinations.
He's the one who
ordered the x-rays, he's the one that ordered the
CTs, he's the one that ordered the pathology, he's
the one that took all the information that he
ordered, he's the one that reported in the medical
record that this is a primary lung cancer
adenocarcinoma or non small cell carcinoma of the
lung that spread into the mediastinum, not the other way.
We didn't need an expert to interpret what
happened and we brought the person here who wrote it
to say that's exactly what it was.
Now, the difficulty is that you have to

And so he

But you only have
Counsel for
But Dr. Burns went further, he said not only
is it a cause, it's the cause, it's the overwhelming
cause, it's the substantial cause of Mr. Harford's
adenocarcinoma.
The addiction, but for the need to
keep smoking and have that one more exposure to
carcinogens, the addiction is what caused the lung
cancer in Mr. Harford.
You heard from Dr. Scanlon -- again, this
isn't an expert who is looking for the evidence that
helps his testimony.
You heard from Dr. Scanlon and
he said the test I used to find out what the cell
type was for Mr. Harford is 90 percent accurate.
Actually, he said greater than 90 percent accurate.
He said I did think it was inoperable, I did think
he was going to die, I did tell him that you should
have radiation or some combination of other things, 69
but it's going to only be palliative, it's only
going to be trying to comfort you as you die, you're
going to die, Mr. Harford.
That's what he said.
But we don't, unfortunately, because of the
time, because of the way these lawsuits evolve over
time, we didn't have the ability to capture records
that existed then that weren't purged in the
ordinary course of business.
records are purged after a certain numbers of years.
Today I think it's seven years.
That is, doctors'
But what we do have and what we have been able
to gather and what we have been able to capture
support not only the diagnosis of primary
adenocarcinoma, but that this adenocarcinoma was in
the lung primarily and it was caused by his smoking.
Dr. Scanlon was unequivocal about whether the
smoking played a role in his lung cancer.
Dr. Scanlon said it was the most significant risk
factor for his smoking -- for his lung cancer, the
years of -- 35-plus years of smoking.
Another very important fact.
Dr. Burns said
it doesn't matter the precise date that Mr. Harford
quit, doesn't matter if he quit in '92, '90, '88,
'85.
than sufficient to be a cause, the cause, the
The risk factor of that much smoking was more 70
substantial cause of Mr. Harford's adenocarcinoma of
the lung.
Again, trust your eyes.
Dr. Scanlon talked
about the clinical presentations, all the things
that showed up when he got there, all consistent
with primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.
Even Dr. Cumar yesterday agreed with me that
these clinical presentations were consistent with
somebody with primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.
Shortness of breath, spitting up blood, heavy
smoking history, weight loss, pain.
Then he said another objective bit of evidence
was the radiographs, the films, the x-rays, what was
in the lung by looking further with imagery.
Dr. Scanlon relied on those, Dr. Scanlon ordered
those, Dr. Scanlon used those as the primary
pulmonologist diagnosing this disease and he found
it was a primary lung adenocarcinoma.
And as everybody will say, including
Dr. Cumar, the highest level of evidence that we
have in this case about this being an adenocarcinoma
is the pathology.
pathology, the doctor who went and wrote the report
about the pathology, he came here and he said I
ordered the biopsy, I ordered an aspirate, I usually
The doctor who ordered the 71
order a core sample, it's very reliable, 90-plus
percent reliable, and I did it and this was by
pathology, by clinical presentation and by radiology
and by my years of treating patients with
smoking-related illness, Dr. Scanlon, without a dog
in the fight, said this was primary adenocarcinoma
of the lung.
Question number 2 is simple.
The answer is
"yes" to question number 2.
Next.
Look through the record, you'll see it
all, I've highlighted it, I'm not going to go

Every description by the

out of the lung which means it's primarily in the
lung and growing out.
There was never a description of the
Next.
You've seen this, I'm not going to bore
you with it other than to say Mr. Harford's smoking
pattern was exactly like every other smoker in that
cohort, that is in that population of American
smokers.
He started to smoke when people were 72
And you heard Mr. Heimann
starting to smoke.
yesterday from the American Tobacco Company, you
heard him talk about the direct correlation.
As
advertising goes up, the consumption goes up, the
influence of the tobacco industry to send the
message of the pleasures, the enjoyment goes up.
And as information starts to come out there are dips
and bends, but the smoking rates go down as true,
accurate information goes in.
Why is that important?
Mr. Harford is being
held to a totally different standard than the
R.J. Reynolds Company if you do not agree that he
can only know what's accurately told to him.
And if
it's not accurate and complete, if it's not part of
a doubt and controversy campaign that gives him the
psychological crutch you've seen to keep smoking,
then it's not about his choice, it's about his
addiction.
So the one battle in this courtroom was with

So we get to the first two
questions and then the next question becomes sort of
the ultimate question.
You answer these first three
questions yes, Mr. Harford then, in your opinion,
your decision, Mr. Harford belongs in that group of
Florida smokers entitled to the findings that
R.J. Reynolds put out a product that was
unreasonably dangerous and defective.
and I won't repeat it.
You heard,
The second question is was it a primary 77

caused by the nicotine in cigarettes.
Dr. Burns is
the only person who says that it's the addiction and
the nicotine that causes the lung cancer.
Dr. Scanlon said importantly is not that, he said I

caused his lung cancer.
What
Dr. Burns then fits it into the Engle
And
And you heard about
And the answer is yes.
Did the addiction to the nicotine in
question.
R.J. Reynolds' cigarettes cause -- was it a cause of
Mr. Harford's lung cancer?
For all the reasons we just went through.
Dr. Burns said that explicitly.
the way it comes in, nicotine and carcinogens go
into the cigarettes into the system.
To get the
dose of nicotine you want, you've got to get
everything else, you've got to get all those
carcinogens with it.
the number of puffs that Mr. Harford had of
R.J. Reynolds' product, between 3 and 4.5 million
doses of carcinogen from R.J. Reynolds' product that
if you find that he's a member of this class, that
unreasonably defective product over 4.5 million
puffs from R.J. Reynolds into Mr. Harford.

cause, which is all you have to find, but it is the
cause, the substantial cause, and the overwhelming
cause.
It's not just a
Next slide.
Now, you'll see in the instructions to prove
that addiction to smoking cigarettes containing
nicotine caused him to develop primary lung
adenocarcinoma, Mr. Harford must prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that is a little more
than not, that is 51 percent, Mr. Harford has to
prove that such addiction directly and in a natural
and continuous sequence produced or substantially
contributed to producing the disease, such that it
can reasonably be said that but for the addiction,
the disease would not have occurred.
But for the need, but for the compulsion, but
for the behavioral, but for the pharmacological need
to keep smoking, this would not have occurred.
That's interesting because as you go back to the
documents and if you remember we had this Trip
report going back to 1958, Plaintiff's Exhibit 158,
this was known in the '50s when Mr. Harford started.
With one exception, individuals whom we meet believe
that smoking causes lung cancer if by causation we
mean any chain of events which leads finally to lung 79
cancer and which involves smoking as an
indispensable link.

They made them.
R.J. Reynolds had choices.
All we're
Use these
We went through them in the beginning.
Engle jury told you what the effect of those choices
were.
R.J. Reynolds chose to create an environment where
it was a social norm to smoke cigarettes.
Saw the
ads, saw the testimony, the military service men,
the sports, actors.
R.J. Reynolds chose to create a
product that was mass marketed and highly addictive.
They chose to engineer it in a way that they could
control anything, any amount of nicotine delivered
to the brain.
You saw the testimony about the kick,
giving a little kick so that smokers get it faster. 84
R.J. Reynolds chose to create an environment
where there was doubt and controversy about the
health hazards instead of publicly disclosing what
they knew internally about the risk of causing lung
cancer.
And
they have chose to sell a product they knew was
hazardous, leading to the deaths of more than
400,000 people here.
That's a choice.
That's a choice.

Hill &
Knowlton, back in 1953 when they started the doubt
and controversy campaign, they said that the
founding members and the research directed to all
the companies knew that smoking caused lung cancer.
You saw the nicotine memos and the Hippo 88
studies and how they would tell that from the
Surgeon General and never shared that with the
public in 1963.
They talked about how you maximize the amount
of nicotine such that you're keeping the smokers
coming in and going out at equal levels so that
sales don't go down.
And of course the Nordine

They were engineering a cigarette to do exactly what
happened to Mr. Harford, which was keep smoking that
next cigarette, that next puff, that next exposure
to carcinogen.
This is the be all and end all.
They did it
in a way where they were highlighting the exquisite
nature, the attractive forms, the dosages of
nicotine, and intentionally downplayed the tar.
They intentionally kept from the smoker the idea

It's a motive.
Continue to sell, continue the doubt
and controversy, even though we know the statistics
about death and injury from our products, all we
need are paper bags of money.
And there is no evidence disputing that the
cigarette companies are in the nicotine business,
they designed and engineered the product to sustain
that, and they had the knowledge about the health
effects and the addictiveness of it going back into 91
the early stages of Mr. Harford's smoking, and they
denied it.
Next.
You saw the evidence.

Well, the data is the data and you can decide what
the data means, but the data, not the conclusions,
are very clear.
This is Exhibit 129, the 1981 FTC report.
It
says even if it is assumed that every consumer is
aware that smoking is hazardous, the evidence 93
indicates that many consumers do not have enough
information about the health risks of smoking in
order to know how dangerous smoking is.
Dr. Burns talked specifically about
Next.
this.
He said that Mr. Harford in his smoking
pattern, in his way, he developed a lung cancer
because he didn't really believe it related to him.
And the tobacco company's effort to create doubt and
controversy was specifically targeted at the smoker
like him who tried to quit, wanted to quit, couldn't
quit, didn't quit, and whether he quit in '85, '88,
'90, or '92, the campaign was successful because he
had enough dose in him to cause lung cancer.
Next.
There is no evidence disputing that
R.J. Reynolds knew that cigarettes were hazardous.
The cigarette companies want their customers to
remain unsatisfied and the cigarette companies
created a pervasive campaign of doubt and
controversy.
That's how it relates to Mr. Harford.
Both Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns talked about
the tobacco industry's interaction with the public
health.
You
saw the development of the doubt and controversy
campaign.
And just towards the end of the trial you
saw in 1960 the American Tobacco Company, for which
You saw the various representations. 94
R.J. Reynolds is responsible, trying to find a

he had been so successful at that point at keeping
the American Medical Association from saying
anything about a causative link between smoking and
lung cancer.
They're celebrating their successes of
keeping this information not just from Mr. Harford,
but from doctors, associations of doctors like the
American Medical Association.
They don't share their full knowledge.

You're not going to do it where you're going to
create more confusion.
He's not making this up.
And he told you as sincerely as he is, he quit in
1992.
The important fact is it doesn't matter
whether he quit in '85, '88, '90, or '92, it doesn't
matter.
Because he quit and he stayed quit because
of a terminal lung cancer diagnosis.
Number 5, "Did Mr. Harford rely to his
detriment on statements by R.J. Reynolds?"
He did.
The advertising is designed to be relied upon.
He
told you that they were relying upon it, that they
expected them to rely upon it, he did rely upon it.
He took every single bit of what was positive out of
the advertisements in, and there was nothing
negative, nothing warning, nothing that said in 1951 99
or in 1953 when Teague found out, or '56, nothing
saying this is going to cause lung cancer.
certainly nothing in any of the advertisements that
he relied upon that said that the ones that he chose
to smoke for taste were two and a half times more
carcinogenic than the other cigarettes.

Next.
"Was the reliance a cause of
William Harford's primary lung adenocarcinoma?"
Listen, if he relied and he kept smoking and he
didn't internalize it and he didn't appreciate it
and he is the subject of this doubt and controversy
which caused him to keep smoking, he relied on it.
Did he reasonably rely to his detriment on
statements made in furtherance of R.J. Reynolds'
agreement with the other cigarette manufacturers to
conceal or omit material information concerning the
health effects or addictive nature of smoking?
Simply, yes.
He relied and it caused him to have lung cancer.

And the Tobacco Institute made its statements
in 1988, it said after years of well-founded
research it's not been established that cigarette
smoking produces a physical dependence on nicotine.
In 1994 they go to Congress and they say it again.

part of doubt and controversy, all statements made
both before and after 1982, thus we think you should
check off "both before and after 1982."
They're saying this in the media.
Was it a reliance which was the cause of
Mr. Harford's primary lung carcinoma?
all the reasons we talked about.
It was, for
And then R.J. Reynolds, as Dr. Cummings told
you, understanding and appreciating for so long the
risks, kept it from the public, created this doubt
and controversy, kept the smoker smoking, and as
Dr. Burns told you it was directly related to him.
That campaign of doubt and controversy started in
1953, it continued past 1982.
Next.

ultimate question at least with respect to 102
You're going to be asked, so if you

answer the first three questions "yes," addiction,
adenocarcinoma, and then cause, you're going to have
an opportunity to apportion fault between
R.J. Reynolds and Mr. Harford if you decide to.
In 1991 he made $35,000.
This number that you come up with in question
11, if you get to this question, is going to be the
number that those percentages are applied to.

example, if you found -- you heard testimony from
Mr. Harford that he worked before getting the

decide whether he was making $35,000 a year, whether
he was on track that year to make $50,000 a year.
If you get to this question about lost earnings, you
get to put a number in of what he lost by not
working for four years because of the devastating
impact of those radiation treatments and what it
took out of him.
After the
Let's say, for example, that number comes out

The third area is the one which is really not
defined by a rule -- I shouldn't say that, it's a

But this is something where you get to decide
if anything is justified for the pain and suffering
that Mr. Harford had.
This is a number that you'll
come up with and it's for any pain and suffering
from the lung cancer, from the treatment, or from
what was left of the treatment, the disability or
physical impairment, if you think the wheezing is
related, the mental anguish of going through that, 104
the inconvenience, the loss of capacity for the
enjoyment of life in the past and in the future, for
any future concern he may have about lung cancer.

You add all that up and then that's
where the percentages are applied, against that one
number.
So if anything is awarded to Mr. Harford, it
will be the percentage that he's not responsible for
of that total amount.
And the court will make that
calculation, not you.

He lost 20 pounds during this process,

He couldn't work for four years.
You heard
everybody, including defense expert, talked about
That created all sorts of mental 106
the scarring in his lung just from the radiation
alone and how that kills a portion of the lung.
And
you heard yourself in his voice in his speaking, the
wheezing that he suffered.
He continues to this day and as is reflected
in the medical records in 2000, 2004 and 2005, every
time he hears that there is something wrong with his
lungs, every time he has to look into what's going
on, why he's feeling the way he's feeling, he has
this constant and actually appropriate fear because
as a smoker, as Dr. Burns told you, as a smoker he's
at an increased risk of further smoking-related
illness including cancer.
He has a constant fear.
Not just that he's going to die; he's 82 years old.
But he's going to have to go through that again, go
through those months and years of pain, suffering,
anguish, depression, and inability to function.
That's what you consider when you decide if there is
a value of pain and suffering that you should award

Dr. Scanlon talked about the uniqueness of
this, but he also talked about the extreme, the
extreme therapy that he had to go through and how
what was left behind in all those times that he was
fearful that his cancer had come back was actually
just damage from the treatment that cured him.
So the final question is, same place where we
started, you heard the evidence, there is no greater
example of egregious conduct, there is no greater
example of serious public wrong than a company that
puts out a product that it knows kills and that when
it comes time to take responsibility, because they
had the choice and they had the control and it's

[#DELETED RECESS#]
MR. MIGLIORI: Thank you, Your Honor.
Ladies and gentlemen, again forgive me. I
think it's getting worse as we get into the afternoon.
The only thing that was left was the last
question on the form, and this is the question that's on
the board right now about punitive damages.
Do you find by clear and convincing
evidence -- and the Court explained to you what that
is -- that punitive damages are warranted against R. J. 5 Reynolds under the circumstances of this case?
When you marshal through all of the
questions and follow here and follow back and go back,
when you get to No. 12 we ask that you check off yes.
And all I need to say in reference to the evidence that
supports that is you've been here all this time.
You know that the TIRC and CTR and the
Tobacco Institute started in 1954. They publicly stated
and promised their tobacco products were not injurious to
health. They kept that misrepresentation through 1998,
long after the 1982 in the prior questions.
And so we ask on this point that you hold
them responsible in a way where -- when I wrote on the
board, their egregious conduct which severely impacted
the public health be punished. That's what you are here
for to decide, and we hope that on this Question No. 12
you check off yes.
Again, thank you for your time. And I'll
have a moment to speak with you after Mr. Belasic is
done. Thank you.


MR. MIGLIORI: I don't think I'll use the
whole time, Your Honor.
Good afternoon. So this is the end and this
is my last time to speak with you.
And I got to tell you there are two things
after that summation by Mr. Belasic that strike me the
most.
Now, one, he said that R. J. Reynolds is not
going to blame Mr. Harford, the smoker, and yet for an
hour and a half that's all he did. Not once did he take
responsibility for R. J. Reynolds' part. Not once did he
acknowledge R. J. Reynolds' part in making Mr. Harford a
lifetime smoker.
Mr. Harford is not here saying it's all
R. J. Reynolds' fault; he's saying it's time under the
law for a jury to decide what fault R. J. Reynolds bears
in his disease. That's what he's asking. He's asking
for sincerity.
Mr. Belasic also apparently tried the case
against me. I've never been more disparaged in a
closing. I'm not here, ladies and gentlemen, to try to
convince you of anything other than what is in front of
you with the evidence that we've tried so hard to put
before you efficiently and honestly. 79 Mr. Harford suffered from an adenocarcinoma
that was diagnosed by Dr. Scanlon. There's no record
dispute. There's nothing in the record or from
Dr. Scanlon that contradicts that. That is the second
most important question on this form, what was the
cancer.
The reason why we brought Dr. Scanlon is
very simple. Dr. Scanlon diagnosed the condition. He's
the doctor. He's the pulmonologist that ordered the
pathology. He's the doctor that ordered the radiology
and he's the doctor that asked for Dr. Dickerson, the
radiation oncologist, to take care and treat him.
Why didn't you bring Dr. Dickerson? That
was the question raised by Mr. Belasic. You don't bring
the radiation oncologist because they don't diagnose.
The question that you answer on the form is
is this a primary adenocarcinoma. That's a cell type.
That's defined by pathology.
You look at the record, it doesn't say who
the pathologist is. It just says what the pathologist
told the doctor who diagnosed it given not just the
pathology, but the radiology and the clinical symptoms.
We brought you the doctor who diagnoses
patients.
And Dr. Kumar told you himself he does not 80 diagnosis cancer cell types. He can't answer that
question. And he didn't answer that question. And he
offered no other explanation. Why? Radiation
oncologists aren't the doctors who answer Question No. 2
and 3, pathologists are.
And the doctor who took the pathology
information from the pathologist to make the diagnosis
and set out the course of treatment, Dr. Scanlon, he's
the one who came here. He's the one who diagnosed him.
He's the one that you turn to to answer the question was
this a primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.
Don't forget Dr. Kumar wouldn't even say
that this was in the lung. He wouldn't even agree with
all of the medical records showing that it was in the
lung.
This is a primary adenocarcinoma of the
lung. And the records show that. And I ask you to go
look at the medical records yourselves.
Now, Dr. Scanlon said twice that the single
largest risk factor in Mr. Harford's life was the
35 years of smoking when it came to that adenocarcinoma.
He used the absolute best description of causation that
he has, which is it wasn't asbestos, it wasn't chemicals,
it wasn't environmental.
The single most important factor in my 81 patient's cancer, which pathology told me was an
adenocarcinoma, was the 35 plus years. And he didn't say
it once. He said it twice. The second time he said it
just before he sat down he called it the most significant
risk factor for lung cancer. And it was.
And Dr. Burns came in here to talk to you
about the role of addiction and how that links up to
Question No. 3.
There's not a single person who came into
this room and said that Mr. Harford was not addicted by
the medical definitions that were provided to you.
Again, three hours R. J. Reynolds compelled
Mr. Harford to sit through a compulsory medical
examination about which Mr. Belasic spoke at length
during the trial, for three hours.
Mr. Belasic had a transcript of the three
hours that their doctor, their psychologist who is
talking about addiction with Mr. Harford directly. Had a
transcript of that interview.
And yet R. J. Reynolds did not bring that
psychiatrist to this courtroom. They didn't bring that
person here with three hours' worth of information about
addiction about our client.
Without my involvement --
THE COURT: But let me just interject. I'm 82 going to give you the same admonition to treat each of
you equally that I gave to Mr. Belasic.
References to people not brought into the
courtroom is a problem. All right? The jury once again
will have to base its decision upon the evidence in the
case, the inferences to be drawn from it, the absence of
evidence.
But when we talk about people being brought
into the courtroom, I'm a little bit of a stickler on
that because I cautioned the jurors that we don't to
speculate about that. So the same admonition I gave to
Mr. Belasic I'm giving to you. Okay?
MR. MIGLIORI: If I may, Your Honor, this is
different. This is an expert hired about which he spoke.
THE COURT: Just continue with your
comments.
MR. MIGLIORI: So where is the evidence that
he's not addicted? Where is the evidence that
Mr. Harford is not addicted?
They didn't have evidence to support it.
They didn't even vigorously cross on the Fagerstrom or
any of the points of the DSM-V criteria of Dr. Werner.
Dr. Werner and Dr. Burns gave you that testimony and it's
unrefuted.
So getting through this form again is 83 simple. First question, was he addicted. He was
addicted. And that's unrefuted.
The second question, was it a primary
adenocarcinoma of the lung. It's as plain as the paper
and the testimony of Dr. Scanlon.
And was that addiction to the nicotine in
R. J. Reynolds' cigarettes the cause, was it a cause, was
it the substantial cause, was it an overwhelming
substantial cause? All of those answers were provided by
Dr. Burns.
You don't get the dose of carcinogen without
the addiction to need another cigarette. And don't
forget the cigarette that he smoked was two and a half
times more carcinogenic than the other cigarettes on the
market.
The Winston cigarettes were two and a half
more times carcinogenic. Where did R. J. Reynolds ever
tell anybody, including Mr. Harford, about that?
And I'm going to trust you. I trust the
system. This is my career. I'm going to trust you to
understand that the facts that you've just heard were as
loose as I've ever heard before.
MR. BELASIC: Objection on that opinion,
Your Honor.
THE COURT: Overruled. 84 MR. MIGLIORI: Mr. Harford said that if he
had known and appreciated and understood the risks, he
would have quit sooner if he had appreciated it.
Why does that matter? Because R. J.
Reynolds actually set out to do exactly this. This was
their plan.
Can I have Exhibit 84. Was it 84? Can you
blow that up, please. I'll move out of your way.
This was their plan. They planned to do
this. For nearly 20 years this industry has employed a
single strategy to defend itself on three fronts.
The first front, litigation. Politics and
public opinion. While the strategy was brilliantly
conceived and executed over the years, helping us win
important battles, it is only fair to say that it is not
nor was it intended to be a vehicle for victory. On the
contrary, it has been a holding strategy consisting of
creating doubt about the health charge without actually
denying it.
I ask you what is Dr. Kumar's testimony
other than trying to create doubt without giving an
answer? He came here to create doubt about a diagnosis
by doctors who physically examined, talked to, followed
up five days a week, 39 treatments. Those doctors called
it an adenocarcinoma. And Dr. Scanlon came here to tell 85 you that.
Dr. Kumar is part of this strategy --
MR. BELASIC: Objection, Your Honor, it
violates the Court's order.
THE COURT: Sustained.
MR. BELASIC: Page 14 --
THE COURT: Sustained. Don't go there. Go
ahead.
MR. MIGLIORI: This is not an unclear case.
This is not an unclear case. This is not about whether
or not a song was played and therefore Mr. Harford knew.
One of Mr. Belasic's slides actually said
Mr. Harford knew in the 1950s, relying on Uncle Caleb,
relying on all these people.
How do you say that Mr. Harford knew when in
1984 R. J. Reynolds is saying in its advertisements
throughout the country it's not known.
How do you say in this courtroom that
Mr. Harford knew in the '50s and publicly deny it through
1998 through your Tobacco Institute and your Center For
Tobacco Research? How do you do that and then have the
audacity to ask you that you not hold them responsible
for their share of what happened to Mr. Harford?
He's not asking for him to -- he actually
paid the ultimate price. He got cancer. 86 To the extent you decide that there's a
choice issue, I'm telling you that that choice issue is
not a question of addiction. It's a question of how much
fault belongs to him. And if you think he has some fault
because he has choices that he could have made even if
they were constrained choices because of addiction, then
you give him a percentage of fault himself.
But how do you come into this courtroom and
say you have no responsibility to the smoker when you set
out a strategy to keep the smoker smoking and not tell
them the truth, not tell them the truth? Truth matters.
Dr. Cummings told us that the reason why
that chart starts to fall off and people start to quit --
Mr. Belasic showed you 60 million people quit is because
truth matters. And in 1999 and 2000 when these documents
became publicly available it mattered. It caused people
to quit. And it kept new people from starting. It's a
different world.
And when I met you back in front of the
Magistrate Judge to pick this jury, that's what I asked
you. Can you be fair, because you do have to put
yourself back in time. You have to go back in time to
understand when Mr. Harford started.
Nobody was talking about it. And R. J.
Reynolds certainly didn't tell that you the product he 87 started smoking was two and a half times more
carcinogenic. They didn't do anything to make him feel
that what he was doing was something he was doing at his
own risk.
To the contrary, they spent $250 billion
talking about the pleasures of the cigarette without any
warning, $250 billion that were directly tied to market
share. They knew the more they spent on advertising, the
more their company would have the presence in the market.
And now they come here and have the arrogance to say they
shouldn't be held accountable for their share.
You may not think the number's 10 million.
You may think the number is 1 million. You may not think
it's that much. That's your decision.
Mr. Harford is only asking you to come here
to listen to his story, to understand the facts and to
give him a fair trial. And if you think he's addicted,
you have to put yes on No. 1.
If you think it's a primary adenocarcinoma,
like Dr. Scanlon and Dr. Burns testified, you have to
answer yes on Question No. 2.
If you think the nicotine which caused him
to smoke those three to four and a half million puffs of
carcinogens of R. J. Reynolds' products is the reason --
is a cause, not the only cause, but a cause of his 88 primary adenocarcinoma of the lung, you have to answer
yes to No. 3.
He talked about this being a legal product.
I'll tell you what the law is again. This is a case
about Florida law. And under Florida law if you say yes
to those three questions, you're told that R. J. Reynolds
is liable to my client. You're told that their product
unnecessarily, unreasonably was defective.
You're told that R. J. Reynolds misled the
public. You're told that R. J. Reynolds conspired with
other companies to mislead the public. The law in
Florida is that there are a group of people who are
entitled to those findings. That's the law.
The fact that he smoked a product that he
could buy in a store doesn't change the law that R. J.
Reynolds in selling that product put him in a place where
he was exposed to carcinogens that he did not appreciate
were going to cause the disease that he had.
Now, I heard I think -- I heard him say that
it's absolute science. Absolute science that this
couldn't have been adenocarcinoma. That's insanity.
MR. BELASIC: Objection, Your Honor, unfair
commentary.
right.
THE COURT: All right. All right. All 89 Disregard the reference to insanity.
Go ahead.
MR. MIGLIORI: How could that be? It's a
cell type. It's a cell type. You look at that under the
microscope.
Dr. Kumar came here and he actually said, I
don't know what the shape of that tumor was. I don't
know what it looked like. We don't know because we don't
have the films.
And now we look at softballs and golf balls
as if to describe something that is absolutely crystal
clear, absolute science.
Please just be fair. Trust your
understanding. Trust what you heard. That's all we're
asking.
I'm not asking you to do anything other than
apply Florida law, which says this company if we prove
those three facts is liable to my client.
And to the extent you think that Mr. Harford
bears a responsibility beyond the -- the price he's
already paid of having a lung cancer, having damage to
his upper left lobe of his tissue from the radiation to
cure it, if you think beyond that price he's paid he
should pay more, then you give him a percentage of fault
for his choices. That's the law in Florida. That's the 90 law about this legal product.
There are so many things that R. J. Reynolds
could have done and didn't do. And not one of them --
not one of them did Mr. Belasic come up here and explain
away.
It's almost as if we say, R. J. Reynolds,
yes, we did all that. The Engle findings are accurate,
but it didn't matter because we didn't convince this
person.
How do we know it affected this person? How
do we know that Mr. Harford falls in that category of
people affected? Because when I showed you that graph of
the rise of smoking and the fall of smoking, he fits in
that graph exactly how other people affected by the same
advertising, affected by the same messages, affected by
the same doubt and controversy campaign.
He started to smoke when it was cool. And
he stopped -- whether it was '85, '88 or '92, he stopped
when information became available.
And if you believe Mr. Belasic that this
really was 1985 and everything else Mr. Harford came
before you about quitting in '92 is a lie, if you believe
Mr. Belasic, think about the one thing that happened in
1985 that made a difference maybe.
1985 was the first time lung cancer was put 91 on the package. 1985 was the first time lung cancer was
put on the package.
If Mr. Belasic is right, isn't that curious?
We're talking about how information matters. Doubt
cannot prevail in this courtroom.
Not only should there be an award for
compensatory damages once you find the first three
answers are yes, but you should find like every other
smoker on that rise up and on that rise down, Mr. Harford
was susceptible, was a product of the direct advertising
of all the benefits and none of the risks, just like that
initial document said. And he didn't quit until it was
too late.
And it caused an adenocarcinoma that almost
killed him. And thank God it didn't.
But if three to five percent of the people
survive this and he's one of the three to five percent,
he is here as a person with great fortune to be able to
tell this story and to be able to ask you not just for
compensation, which he's asking for -- I'm not hiding
behind that -- but he's asking for accountability.
And here in the United States, just like I
said to you when we picked the jury, this is the only
place where you get to do that. What an extraordinary
thing. This is the only place where a jury gets to hold 92 a corporation accountable if we prove our facts.
That's what we're asking you to do. We're
not asking you to do anything -- I'm not trying to
convince you of something that's not on the paper. I'm
not asking you to try to convince you of something that's
not what a treating doctor said. I'm asking you to be
fair.
And I trust this system and I trust your
recollection of the facts, not necessarily what you just
heard.
I'm not going to go through the timeline of
knowledge. I'm not going to go through the Engle
findings again. But what I'm going to say is your
document, your instructions that you'll have, they have
everything in there. The Engle findings are there. Read
them. Understand what that means when you get to that
point.
Understand that this was a successful doubt
and controversy campaign. And it did as Dr. Burns told
you, it did directly impact this person who relied on
their statements.
It's your right to make a decision if they
need to be punished for this. And they should be
punished for this. And we're asking you to hold them
accountable for all those things that in an hour and a 93 half Mr. Belasic did not once defend.
Thank you for your time. I apologize for my
voice.
But thank you for staying healthy through
the week. I'm very proud to represent Mr. Harford, and I
really appreciate what you've given us in terms of your
time. Thank you.
