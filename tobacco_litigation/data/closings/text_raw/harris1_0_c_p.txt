MS. LONDON: THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. IN A LITTLE
WHILE YOU WILL GO BACK INTO THE JURY ROOM AND YOU WILL HAVE
THREE VERY IMPORTANT JOBS TO DO. FIRST, YOUR JOB WILL BE TO
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ON THE VERDICT FORM THAT THE
JUDGE GIVES YOU. THE SECOND WILL BE TO FOLLOW THE LAW THAT
THE JUDGE INSTRUCTS YOU ON. AND THE THIRD IS GOING TO BE TO
TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE EVIDENCE AND
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
44 WHAT YOU THINK WE'VE PROVED IN THIS CASE.
SO FOR THE NEXT HOUR I'M NOT GOING TO READ THROUGH
ALL THIS EVIDENCE THAT YOU HEARD, AND I KNOW YOU WERE PAYING
CAREFUL ATTENTION. WHAT I AM GOING TO DO IS GIVE YOU SOME
HELP OR SOME IDEAS FOR HOW TO TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT THE CASE.
SO AS I TOLD YOU, ABOUT A WEEK-AND-A-HALF AGO,
THERE'S THREE REASONS WHY WE SUED. THE FIRST WAS BECAUSE THE
CIGARETTE COMPANIES VIOLATED THE SAFETY RULE THAT YOU HAVE TO
TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DANGERS YOU KNEW ABOUT IN YOUR
PRODUCT. AND THE CIGARETTE -- WELL, THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES'
WITNESSES THEY TOLD YOU THEMSELVES, AND I THINK MR. JUPE
SAID, HE SAID, "INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS." CIGARETTE COMPANIES VIOLATED THIS
RULE IN THREE WAYS.
FIRST -- THANKS, JEFF. YOU CAN TAKE THAT DOWN.
FIRST, THEY DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT THEY
KNEW, WHEN THEY KNEW IT ABOUT THEIR CIGARETTES CAUSING
DISEASE AND DEATH. AND INSTEAD THEY SPENT 50 YEARS CREATING
A CAMPAIGN OF DOUBT, DENIAL AND CONTROVERSY.
THE SECOND WAY THEY DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT
THE WAY THAT THEIR PRODUCTS WERE SO ADDICTIVE OR WHAT THEY
DID TO MAKE THEM AS ADDICTIVE AS POSSIBLE.
AND THE THIRD WAY IS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TELL THE
TRUTH ABOUT FILTERS, AND LOW TAR, AND LIGHT CIGARETTES THAT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
45 THOSE DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD, DIDN'T MAKE THE PRODUCTS ANY SAFER
AT ALL. THE PROOF OF ALL THIS, YOU SAW, CAME FROM THEIR OWN
DOCUMENTS. AND THE SURGEON GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES WHO
CAME AND LOOKED AT ALL THIS EVIDENCE TOO REACHED THE SAME
CONCLUSION.
SO THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES THEY SHOULD HAVE
FOLLOWED THE BASIC RULES WE HAVE FOR ALL MANUFACTURERS. YOU
HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU KNOW IT.
IF THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES HAD FOLLOWED THIS RULE AND HAD
TOLD THE TRUTH THEN MR. HARRIS AND MILLIONS OF OTHER
AMERICANS COULD HAVE MADE A FULLY INFORMED CHOICE BEFORE IT
WAS TOO LATE.
THE SECOND REASON I TOLD YOU THAT WE SUED IS
BECAUSE THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES VIOLATED THE SAFETY RULE THAT
YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR PRODUCTS AS SAFE AS REASONABLY
POSSIBLE. THEY VIOLATED THIS RULE BY MAKING THEM AS
ADDICTIVE AS POSSIBLE. AND AGAIN, THE PROOF OF THIS CAME
FROM THEIR VERY OWN DOCUMENTS, AND PROFESSOR PROCTOR HE
EXPLAINED THAT TO YOU.
THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE THOSE
CIGARETTES AS ADDICTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND HERE'S WHY.
DR. BURNS EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT THE ADDICTION IS THE KEY
DANGER, THE KEY DANGER IN CIGARETTE SMOKING. IT'S THE
ADDICTION THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO SMOKE DAY-AFTER-DAY,
YEAR-AFTER-YEAR, DECADE-AFTER-DECADE EXPOSING THEIR BODIES TO
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
46 CHEMICALS, THE THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS AND SMOKE THAT
CAUSE ALL OF THE DISEASES THAT YOU SEE UP HERE ON THIS CHART
AND THAT WE'VE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT IN THIS TRIAL. IF THE
CIGARETTE COMPANIES HAD NOT MADE THEIR PRODUCTS AS ADDICTIVE
AS POSSIBLE, IF THEY HAD FOLLOWED THE BASIC SAFETY RULES,
THEN MR. HARRIS WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN SO POWERFULLY ADDICTED
AND WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY.
FINALLY, THE THIRD REASON THAT WE SUED IS BECAUSE
THE COMPANIES VIOLATED THE BASIC RULE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO
MARKET A PRODUCT, YOU HAVE TO DO IT RESPONSIBLY. THEY
VIOLATED THIS RULE BY GOING OUT AND TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE
WITH THEIR ADVERTISING, THEIR PROMOTION AND THEIR DESIGN.
THE PROOF OF THIS, AGAIN, WAS IN THEIR OWN DOCUMENTS. AND
THE UNITED STATES SURGEON GENERAL LOOKED AT ALL THE EVIDENCE
AND REACHED THE EXACT SAME CONCLUSION THAT THEY TARGETED,
MARKETED AND DESIGNED CIGARETTES FOR KIDS AND STILL DO IT
TODAY.
THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT.
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE MARKETED THEIR PRODUCTS IRRESPONSIBLY.
AND AGAIN, DR. BURNS EXPLAINED THIS TO YOU. THE YOUNGER
SOMEONE STARTS THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO
GET POWERFULLY ADDICTED, AND THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THEY ARE
GOING TO GET A DISEASE AND DIE. THAT'S WHY MARKETING TO
CHILDREN IS SO DANGEROUS AND WHY IT'S A VIOLATION OF THIS
SAFETY RULE. IF THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES HAD NOT DONE THIS,
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
47 THEN MR. HARRIS AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
ENTICED TO START SMOKING SO YOUNG WHEN EVEN THEIR OWN
WITNESSES AGREED THEIR BRAINS WERE VULNERABLE AND WOULDN'T BE
VERY GOOD AT EVALUATING RISK.
NOW, I TOLD YOU IN THE BEGINNING THAT YOUR MAIN JOB
IN THIS TRIAL WOULD BE TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY
THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES BEAR FOR WHAT THEY DID AND FOR THE
PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT THEY CAUSED.
NOW REMEMBER, MR. GENTRY, ONE OF THE CIGARETTE
COMPANY WITNESSES, EVEN HE AGREES CIGARETTE COMPANIES
ULTIMATELY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. SO
LET'S -- WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. HOW TO GO ABOUT
FIGURING OUT HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE.
BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, A LITTLE BIT, ABOUT THE
INSTRUCTIONS THAT THE JUDGE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU. AND AGAIN,
ONE OF THE JOBS I TOLD YOU WILL HAVE TO DO, YOU HAVE TO
FOLLOW THE JUDGE'S INSTRUCTIONS. IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT INSTRUCTION NO. 13.
ALL RIGHT. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS, ABOUT THE BURDEN
OF PROOF, AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WHEN WE TALKED A
WEEK-AND-A-HALF AGO ABOUT WHAT THE BURDEN IS THAT WE HAVE TO
PROVE. AND HERE'S WHAT THIS JURY INSTRUCTION SAYS. JURY
INSTRUCTION NO. 13, IT SAYS, "WE HAVE TO PROVE YOU MUST BE
PERSUADED, CONSIDERING ALL THE EVIDENCE, THAT THE PROPOSITION
IS MORE PROBABLY TRUE THAN NOT TRUE." AND THAT'S WHAT WE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
48 TALKED ABOUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS ALL ALONG. MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG, EVEN
JUST A LITTLE BIT, EVEN JUST BY A HAIR. MORE LIKELY RIGHT
THAN WRONG. TIP THE SCALES JUST A LITTLE BIT IN OUR FAVOR.
SO IF DURING DELIBERATIONS IF SOMEBODY SAYS, "I
HAVE DOUBTS. I'M NOT SURE. I'M NOT CERTAIN." REMIND THEM
ABOUT THIS BURDEN. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY TO HAVE ALL THE
DOUBTS IN THE WORLD. IT'S OKAY NOT TO BE SURE. I WOULDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO BE. IN THIS CASE THAT'S THIS HOTLY CONTESTED,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SURE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE CERTAIN. ALL
WE NEED TO PROVE MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG, MORE PROBABLY
TRUE THAN NOT, EVEN IF BY A HAIR. AND IF YOU FIND THAT, THEN
YOU HAVE TO FIND IN OUR FAVOR ON THAT QUESTION.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, JEFF. YOU CAN TAKE THAT
DOWN.
AS THE JUDGE TOLD YOU AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS
TRIAL, THIS CASE COMES AFTER A BIG CLASS ACTION CASE. AND
THIS WAS A BIG CLASS CASE AGAINST THESE CIGARETTE COMPANIES
AND THESE DEFENDANTS HERE INVOLVING A CLASS OF FLORIDA
SMOKERS WHO GOT ADDICTED AND SICK FROM SMOKING CIGARETTES IN
THE EARLY 1990'S. IT WAS A LONG TRIAL. THERE WERE A LOT OF
EXHIBITS AND A LOT MORE WITNESSES THAN YOU SAW HERE. IN THAT
CASE THE JURY REACHED A VERDICT ON SOME VERY IMPORTANT
THINGS, VERY SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT FINDINGS AFTER HEARING
ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THAT CASE. AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
49 THAT A LITTLE LATER. SOME OF THESE FINDINGS INCLUDES THAT
CIGARETTES ARE ADDICTING, THAT THEY CAUSED A NUMBER OF
DISEASES ON THE LIST AND THAT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES
CONCEALED AND CONSPIRED WITH ONE ANOTHER TO HIDE INFORMATION.
THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT FINDINGS. ANYONE WHO CAN SHOW THAT
THEY WERE PART OF THIS CLASS, THIS GROUP OF FLORIDA SMOKERS,
THOSE FINDINGS WILL APPLY IN THAT CASE. SO THAT'S WHY WE
HAVE TO FIRST SHOW YOU THAT MR. HARRIS WAS A MEMBER OF THAT
CLASS. THAT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST THRESHOLD ISSUE THAT YOU
ALL ARE GOING TO DECIDE.
THAT PRETTY MUCH COMES DOWN TO THIS: WHETHER
MR. HARRIS' ADDICTION TO CIGARETTES WAS A CAUSE OF HIS HEART
DISEASE OR -- AND/OR A CAUSE OF HIS ORAL CAVITY CANCER BEFORE
NOVEMBER OF 1996.
MR. COFER: OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR, MISSTATES THE
STANDARD. IT'S A LEGAL CAUSE.
THE COURT: REPHRASE IF YOU WOULD. YOU CAN
ACTUALLY USE THE INSTRUCTION, IF YOU LIKE, AT THIS POINT.
MS. LONDON: ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT
WAS A CAUSE. IT WAS A LEGAL CAUSE. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO
PROVE THAT ADDICTION TO CIGARETTES WAS A LEGAL CAUSE OF MR.
HARRIS' HEART DISEASE OR ORAL CAVITY CANCER BEFORE
NOVEMBER 21, 1996. AND AGAIN, IF ANYTHING I SAY DEVIATES IN
ANYWAY FROM WHAT THE JUDGE IS INSTRUCTING YOU, YOU HAVE TO
FOLLOW WHAT THE JUDGE IS SAYING. ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
50 ABOUT IT.
ALL RIGHT. SO ONCE YOU FIGURE THAT OUT, ONCE YOU
FIGURE OUT THAT BASIC QUESTION, THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW TO
FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES
BEAR. AND TO BE CLEAR, MR. HARRIS' FAULT, ANY OTHER CAUSES,
ANY OTHER FAULTS, ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING TO COME LATER,
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS CLASS MEMBERSHIP QUESTION IS ABOUT.
LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT THAT QUESTION IS. NO. 1. (CAN YOU PUT
THAT UP, JEFF, QUESTION NO. 1?)
ALL RIGHT. THE FIRST QUESTION IS, "WHETHER MORE
LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG THE PLAINTIFF, MRS. HARRIS, HAS
PROVED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT MR. HARRIS WAS
ADDICTED TO THE NICOTINE IN CIGARETTES." OKAY.
SO YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS IN THIS TRIAL.
I'M NOT GOING TO REHASH EVERYTHING. WHAT DOES ADDICTION
MEAN? ADDICTION IS DEFINED AS A CHRONIC RELAPSING BRAIN
DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY COMPULSIVE DRUG SEEKING AND USE,
DESPITE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES. IT IS CONSIDERED A BRAIN
DISEASE BECAUSE DRUGS CHANGE THE BRAIN; THEY CHANGE ITS
STRUCTURE AND HOW IT WORKS.
NOW, DR. BURNS WHO WROTE THE CHAPTER ON NICOTINE
ADDICTION, IN THAT MEDICAL TEXTBOOK, THE ONE USED BY MEDICAL
DOCTORS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, HE EXPLAINED TO YOU HOW HE AND
OTHER TREATING DOCTORS FIGURE OUT WHETHER SOMEBODY IS
ADDICTED AND MEETS THAT DEFINITION. AND HE USED THE ACCEPTED
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
51 PUBLISHED DEFINITION FROM THE SURGEON GENERAL FROM THE
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE. AND HE TOLD YOU WHAT IT
REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS COMPULSIVE USE DESPITE HARM.
WELL, HE CONCLUDED MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG AND
BEYOND THAT HE'S CERTAIN THAT MR. HARRIS MET THAT DEFINITION.
THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO CIGARETTES CONTAINING NICOTINE, AND
WE SHOWED YOU HIS WORK. YOU SAW ALL THE EVIDENCE. YOU SAW
THAT ALL THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL. YOU SAW THAT HE SMOKED FIRST
THING IN THE MORNING TO RELIEVE HIS WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS.
EVERY 30 MINUTES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, LAST THING HE DID BEFORE
NIGHT, 1-, 2-, 3-PACKS OF CIGARETTES A DAY, THAT'S 20 TO 60
CIGARETTES A DAY, FOR NEARLY -- FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS. HE
HAD TO LEAVE MOVIES TO GO SMOKE, LEAVE RESTAURANTS TO GO
SMOKE, HE GOT CRAVINGS, NERVOUS AND EDGY WHEN HE TRIED TO
STOP. THAT'S WHAT HIS NEIGHBOR TOLD YOU. AND HE EVEN TRIED
TO SMOKE AFTER HE PHYSICALLY NO LONGER COULD AND HAD A HOLE
IN HIS THROAT. THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF ADDICTION. THAT'S
THE PICTURE OF IT AND YOU SAW IT HERE IN THIS COURTROOM.
AGAIN, DESPITE HARM, WE KNOW THAT, DESPITE THE FACT
THAT HE HAD A HEART ATTACK, DESPITE THE CANCER ON HIS VOCAL
CORD AND EVEN DESPITE THE CANCER IN HIS ORAL CAVITY
MR. HARRIS CONTINUED TO COMPULSIVELY SMOKE DESPITE THE
HORRIBLE CONSEQUENCES.
AND BEYOND THAT, MR. HARRIS' DOCTORS, THE ONES WHO
ACTUALLY TREATED HIM, EVALUATED HIM, INTERVIEWED HIM, ALL
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
52 THAT, THEY WROTE DOWN RIGHT THERE IN THE RECORDS HISTORY OF
TOBACCO USE. DR. BURNS, OUR MEDICAL DOCTOR, WHO REVIEWS
MEDICAL RECORDS ALL THE TIME, WHO TREATS PATIENTS, HE TOLD
YOU HISTORY OF TOBACCO ABUSE THAT'S A SYNONYM FOR NICOTINE
ADDICTION.
WELL, IN THE FACE OF ALL THAT THE CIGARETTE
COMPANIES, WHAT DID THEY DO? WELL, THEY BROUGHT YOU
DR. KAPLAN. HE DISAGREES WITH THE MEDICAL DOCTORS WHO
TREATED MR. HARRIS. HE'S NEVER WRITTEN ANYTHING IN THIS
AREA, NEVER RESEARCHED, NEVER PUBLISHED ON ANYTHING, DOESN'T
WORK WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL, DOESN'T THINK THE SURGEON
GENERAL IS AUTHORITATIVE, DISAGREES WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL.
HE DIDN'T RELY ON ANYTHING FROM THE WORLDS LEADING SOURCES.
HE DIDN'T RELY ON SURGEON GENERAL REPORTS, NATIONAL INSTITUTE
OF DRUG ABUSE, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, AMERICAN MEDICAL
ASSOCIATION, NONE OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS. HE DIDN'T RELY ON
ANY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTHORITIES ON NICOTINE ADDICTION
AT ALL.
WHAT ELSE DIDN'T HE RELY ON? HE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK
AT THE MILLIONS OF PAGES OR ANY OF THE PAGES OF THE CIGARETTE
COMPANIES OWN DOCUMENTS WHERE THEY WROTE ABOUT NICOTINE
ADDICTION, WHAT IT IS AND HOW IT WORKS IN THEIR CUSTOMERS.
YOU HEARD THOSE ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET,
DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THEM. INSTEAD HE RELIED ON THREE THINGS.
HE RELIED ON THE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT HE PULLED AND
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
53 PICKED AND CHERRY PICKED THINGS OUT OF. HE RELIED ON HIS
CLINICAL WORK OF WHICH HE TOLD YOU ONLY ONE PERCENT OF WHAT
HE DOES IS TREAT PEOPLE SOLELY FOR NICOTINE ADDICTION, AND
THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL, WHICH EVEN HE HAD TO
ADMIT HE USED TO SAY WASN'T THE RIGHT ONE TO USE. ONE THAT
ITSELF DOESN'T EVEN ADDRESS ADDICTION, AND, OF COURSE, ONE
THAT CAUTIONS USING IT IN A SETTING JUST LIKE THIS.
THERE IS SIMPLY NO COMPARISON, NONE AT ALL, BETWEEN
THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF DR. BURNS' EXPERIENCE AND
DR. KAPLAN. THERE IS JUST NO COMPARISON AT ALL ABOUT THAT
AND WHAT DR. KAPLAN CAME IN HERE TO TELL YOU, WHICH IS THAT
NICOTINE ADDICTION PLAYED NO ROLE, HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHY
MR. HARRIS SMOKED AT ALL, BUT EVEN THEN HE HAD TO ADMIT, HE
HAD TO ADMIT MR. HARRIS SMOKED FOR NICOTINE, AND HE HAD TO
ADMIT THAT HE SMOKED DESPITE THE HARM.
SO DURING DELIBERATIONS IF SOMEONE SAYS, "WELL,
MR. HARRIS STOPPED SMOKING, HOW COULD IT BE HE WAS ADDICTED?"
REMIND THEM. REMIND THEM WHAT DR. BURNS SAID, AND THAT IS,
THAT EVEN IF YOU STOP SMOKING, EVEN IF YOU BREAK THROUGH
ADDICTION IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WEREN'T ADDICTED IN THE FIRST
PLACE. AS LONG AS YOU MEET THAT DEFINITION YOU FALL INTO
THIS CATEGORY.
AND AGAIN, IF SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, I THINK HE
SMOKED FOR OTHER REASONS. I THINK HE MAY HAVE ENJOYED THEM."
REMIND THEM, OF COURSE, AND -- REMIND THEM, NICOTINE CHANGES
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
54 BRAIN, IT CREATES THESE RECEPTORS, WHEN YOU SMOKE AND
THAT DOSE OF NICOTINE TO MAKE YOUR BRAIN FEEL NORMAL, THAT
FEELS LIKE RELAXATION, FEELS LIKE ENJOYMENT, FEELS LIKE OTHER
THINGS. SO REMIND THEM THAT YOU CAN BE ADDICTED AND FEEL
ENJOYMENT. ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD FROM ALL THE
WITNESSES WHO TALKED ABOUT THAT. SO THE ANSWER TO QUESTION
ONE, MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG, FRANKLY, BEYOND THAT, IS
THAT MR. HARRIS WAS ADDICTED TO CIGARETTES CONTAINING
NICOTINE. ADDICTED TO THE NICOTINE IN THE CIGARETTES.
ALL RIGHT. QUESTION 2. NEXT QUESTION IS WHETHER
MR. HARRIS HAS -- MRS. HARRIS HAS PROVED THAT MORE LIKELY
THAN NOT MR. HARRIS' ORAL LARYNGEAL CANCER, OR ORAL CANCER
MANIFESTED BEFORE NOVEMBER 21, 1996. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DOES
THIS WORD "MANIFEST" MEAN? THE JUDGE WILL INSTRUCT YOU, THIS
IS INSTRUCTION NO. 16. (JEFF, IF YOU CAN PULL THAT UP.) IT
SIMPLY MEANS THE POINT IN TIME WHEN HIS BODY BEGAN TO SUFFER
SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE RENDERING IT DIAGNOSABLE, NOT
NECESSARILY WHEN THE EXACT NATURE OF THE DISEASES WAS
DIAGNOSED BY A PHYSICIAN AFTER SUFFICIENT TESTING, BUT WHEN
IT BECAME DIAGNOSABLE. ALL RIGHT. (YOU CAN TAKE THAT DOWN.)
NOW, YOU SAW THE EVIDENCE. YOU SAW THE DOCTOR WHO
DID THE RADIOLOGY ON THREE OF MR. HARRIS' CANCERS, ONE WHO
EXPLAINED IT MOST IN DETAIL ON THE RECORDS. HE TOLD YOU IT
WAS IN 1996. YOU ALSO SAW A MEDICAL RECORD FROM ONE OF
MR. HARRIS' DOCTORS SAYING IT STARTED IN OCTOBER OF 1996.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
55 NOW, IF SOMEBODY, DURING DELIBERATIONS, THEY SAY,
"WELL, I DON'T KNOW. THERE WERE A LOT OF RECORDS THAT SAID
1997." REMIND THEM WHAT DR. BURNS SAID. THERE IS NO
INCONSISTENCY AT ALL. THESE RECORDS ALL WORKED TOGETHER.
MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG -- WELL, FIRST OF ALL WHAT HE
EXPLAINED TO YOU WAS THAT FIRST YOU GET THE CANCER, THEN YOU
GET RADIATION AND THEN YOU GET SURGERY. ALL OF THE RECORDS
WORK TOGETHER. MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG MR. HARRIS GOT
THE CANCER, THEY FOUND OUT HE HAD THE CANCER, IN OCTOBER OF
1996. THEN HE HAD RADIATION, AND THEN HE HAD SURGERY IN
MAY OF 1997. PERFECTLY CONSISTENT. ALL THESE RECORDS WORKED
TOGETHER.
NOW, THE LAWYERS FOR THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES THEY
SURE KICKED UP A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT IT. THEY SHOWED
MRS. HARRIS AND DR. BURNS, THEY SHOWED THEM RECORD, AFTER
RECORD, AFTER RECORD, BUT HERE'S WHAT THEY DIDN'T DO. THEY
DIDN'T BRING IN ANY MEDICAL DOCTOR WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE
TALKING ABOUT TO COME IN HERE AND CORROBORATE THIS THEORY
THAT THIS CANCER ONLY CAME IN 1997.
NOW, I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THEY DID BRING YOU A
MEDICAL DOCTOR WHO WAS BOARD CERTIFIED IN INTERNAL MEDICINE.
SOMEBODY WHO SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS REVIEWING ALL THE
MEDICAL RECORDS IN THIS CASE. I THINK IT'S PRETTY
INTERESTING THEY DIDN'T ASK HIM TO CORROBORATE THIS THEORY
THAT THEY HAD THAT THIS CANCER ONLY CAME AFTER NOVEMBER 1996.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
56 MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG. AND AGAIN, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO
HAVE DOUBTS, YOU'RE ALLOWED NOT TO BE CERTAIN. ALL YOU HAVE
-- IF, THOUGH, MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG, EVEN JUST BY A
LITTLE BIT, WE'VE MET OUR BURDEN TO SHOW THAT MR. HARRIS'
ORAL CAVITY CANCER, MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG, MANIFESTED
BEFORE NOVEMBER OF 1996, YOU MUST FIND, WITHOUT QUESTION, IN
OUR FAVOR.
ALL RIGHT. THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHETHER HIS
ADDICTION -- LET'S LOOK AT THIS. WE FIND WHETHER THE
PLAINTIFF HAS PROVED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT
MR. HARRIS' ADDICTION WAS A LEGAL CAUSE OF MR. HARRIS'
CORONARY HEART DISEASE, OR MR. HARRIS' ORAL LARYNGEAL CANCER.
ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN IN TWO
PARTS. ALL RIGHT. (YOU CAN TAKE THAT DOWN.) LET'S BREAK IT
DOWN IN TWO PARTS. THE FIRST REAL QUESTION IS WAS ADDICTION
A CAUSE, A CAUSE WHY HE SMOKED CIGARETTES? A CAUSE WHY HE
CONTINUED TO SMOKE DAY-AFTER-DAY, YEAR-AFTER-YEAR TO GET
ENOUGH SMOKING, TO GET ENOUGH CHEMICALS IN HIS BODY TO CAUSE
THESE DISEASES? AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT, SO I WANT TO
SHOW YOU THIS INSTRUCTION. (CAN YOU PULL THIS UP?)
ALL RIGHT. IN DECIDING WHETHER MR. HARRIS'
ADDITION WAS A LEGAL CAUSE OF EITHER HIS CORONARY HEART
DISEASE OR ORAL CANCER PLAINTIFF NEED NOT PROVE THAT
ADDICTION WAS THE ONLY REASON THAT MR. HARRIS CONTINUED TO
SMOKE. AS LONG AS ADDICTION WAS PART OF THE REASON, AS LONG
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
57 AS THE ADDICTION MADE A DIFFERENCE, AS LONG AS THE ADDICTION
PLAYED A ROLE, THEN, YES, HIS ADDICTION WAS A CAUSE, A LEGAL
CAUSE WHY MR. HARRIS CONTINUED TO SMOKE SO MUCH TO GET SO
SICK.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. AS LONG AS -- WELL,
SOMETHING THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW
THE ROLE THAT NICOTINE ADDICTION PLAYS AND WHY PEOPLE SMOKE?
WHAT DID WE LEARN ABOUT THAT? I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL
THE DETAILS. YOU HEARD IT. I KNOW YOU WERE PAYING
ATTENTION, BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS IN CASE
SOMEBODY BRINGS IT UP IN DELIBERATIONS, "WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WE DON'T KNOW. HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT NICOTINE ADDICTION
REALLY CAUSED HIM TO SMOKE?"
SO HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. WE KNOW IT CAUSES CHANGES
IN THE BRAIN. WITNESSES FROM BOTH SIDES AGREED ON THAT. WE
KNOW THAT PEOPLE SMOKE TO FILL THOSE NICOTINE RECEPTORS TO
GET MORE -- TO FEEL NORMAL. WE LEARNED THAT FROM BOTH
WITNESSES.
YOU SAW IN THE INTERNAL CIGARETTE COMPANIES'
DOCUMENTS, RIGHT, THERE WAS A WHOLE DOCUMENT WHERE IT TALKED
ABOUT PRE-LEARNERS, LEARNERS AND ADDICTED SMOKERS AND WHY
THEY SMOKED. THIS IS PART OF THE STUDY THEY WERE DOING ABOUT
WHY PEOPLE SMOKED AND HAD "PLUS, PLUS, PLUS," UNDER
ADDICTION. THAT'S UNDER NICOTINE. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE
ADDICTED SMOKE, TO GET THAT NICOTINE. TO KEEP PUSHING THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
58 LEVERS TO KEEP GETTING THAT REWARD TO THEIR BRAIN EVERY
30 MINUTES. NOT BECAUSE IT'S FUN. NOT BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT.
NOT BECAUSE IT'S ENJOYABLE. BECAUSE OF ADDICTION. BECAUSE
OF THE NICOTINE.
AND HERE'S WHAT ELSE WE KNOW. NICOTINE ADDICTIONS
IS THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON WHY PEOPLE PERSIST IN SMOKING
CIGARETTES THAT CAUSE SO MUCH DEATH AND DISEASE. THAT'S WHAT
THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS TOLD US. EVEN MR. GENTRY, IT TOOK A
WHILE, BUT EVEN HE ADMITTED NICOTINE ADDICTION IS A
FUNDAMENTAL REASON WHY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO SMOKE
DAY-AFTER-DAY, YEAR-AFTER-YEAR AND GET ENOUGH OF THOSE
CHEMICALS IN THEIR BODY TO GET SICK.
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT NICOTINE ADDICTION IS VERY
POWERFUL. WE LEARNED ABOUT THIS. DR. BURNS EXPLAINED THIS
TO YOU. 70 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO SMOKE WANT TO STOP,
50 PERCENT OF PEOPLE TRY, AND ONLY THREE PERCENT, THREE,
EVERY YEAR MANAGE TO GET OFF OF THEM. THAT'S THE POWER OF
NICOTINE ADDICTION OVER WHY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO SMOKE.
NOW, IF IN DELIBERATIONS SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, I
THINK IT WAS HIS CHOICE. I THINK HE MADE A CHOICE." REMIND
THEM WHAT DR. BURNS SAID, THAT ADDICTION CREATES A DEMAND
THAT CAN OVERRIDE CHOICE. REMEMBER HE TOLD YOU THAT. THAT'S
HOW ADDICTION WORKS. AND ALSO REMIND THEM THAT WE DON'T HAVE
TO SHOW THAT MR. HARRIS SMOKED ONLY BECAUSE OF ADDICTION.
JUST THAT IT PLAYED A ROLE. THAT IT WAS A PART OF THE REASON
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
59 THAT HE SMOKED. YOU CAN FIND BOTH THAT HE WAS ADDICTED AND
THAT HE CHOSE TO SMOKE SO LONG AS HIS ADDICTION WAS A CAUSE
OF WHY HE SMOKED. ALL RIGHT. (YOU CAN TAKE THAT DOWN,
THANKS.)
ALL RIGHT. NOW, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO FIND THAT
MULTIPLE THINGS, MULTIPLE THINGS COMBINED TOGETHER TO CAUSE
MR. HARRIS TO SMOKE. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, SO LONG AS
ADDITION IS ONE OF THE REASONS. IF YOU FIND THAT MORE LIKELY
RIGHT THAN WRONG, EVEN JUST BY A LITTLE BIT, ADDICTION WAS
THE REASON HE KEPT EXPOSING HIMSELF TO ALL THOSE CHEMICALS
THAT GOT HIM SICK, THEN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND FOR US,
AT LEAST ON THAT PART OF THE QUESTION.
THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE
CIGARETTE SMOKING THAT HE SMOKED SO MUCH OF WAS A LEGAL CAUSE
OF THE DISEASES THAT HE GOT. FOR THIS PURPOSE WE'RE ONLY
TALKING ABOUT TWO. REMEMBER, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT
IF HE GETS INTO THIS CLASS. AND THE ONLY ONES THAT MATTER
FOR THIS PURPOSE ARE THE CORONARY HEART DISEASE AND HIS ORAL
CAVITY CANCER. LET'S PUT UP WHAT THIS MEANS, THIS LEGAL
CAUSE. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THIS IS A LEGAL CAUSE. THIS
IS IMPORTANT. IT'S GOING TO BE INSTRUCTION NO. 19.
OKAY. IN ORDER TO BE A LEGAL CAUSE OF INJURY THE
CONDITION NEED NOT BE THE ONLY CAUSE. SOMETHING MAY BE A
LEGAL CAUSE OF INJURY OR DEATH EVEN THOUGH IT OPERATES IN
COMBINATION WITH THE ACT OF ANOTHER, OR SOME NATURAL CAUSE OR
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
60 SOME OTHER CAUSE, IF THE CONDITION OR CONDUCT CONTRIBUTES
SUBSTANTIALLY TO PRODUCING THE INJURY OR DEATH. BOTTOM LINE,
IT JUST HAS TO BE A CAUSE. A CAUSE. NOT THE ONLY CAUSE.
JUST A CAUSE.
DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN
WRONG, AND BEYOND THAT HE'S SURE, THAT MR. HARRIS' ADDICTION
TO CIGARETTES WAS A CAUSE OF HIS CORONARY HEART DISEASE AND
HIS ORAL CAVITY CANCER. AND HE EXPLAINED TO YOU WHY. HE
SHOWED HIS WORK. HE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT WHAT SMOKING DOES TO
THE CELLS IN YOUR THROAT, HOW IT BREAKS DOWN THE DEFENSES,
HOW THEY MUTATE AND THEY GROW OVER TIME AND BECOME A CANCER.
HE EXPLAINED TO YOU WHAT CIGARETTE SMOKING DOES TO DAMAGE THE
BLOOD VESSELS, HOW THAT HAPPENS OVER TIME, IT CREATES
NARROWING, NARROWING, NARROWING THAT CAUSES THE HEART
DISEASE.
NOW, AGAIN, THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT CAUSED HIS
HEART ATTACK, IT'S NOT WHAT CAUSED HIS STROKE, IT'S WHAT
CAUSED HIS CORONARY HEART DISEASE, WHICH AS YOU WERE SHOWN,
WAS DIAGNOSED IN 1994.
DR. BURNS ALSO TOLD YOU THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS
KNOWN AS A MAJOR CAUSE OF THESE DISEASES, AND THAT MR.
HARRIS' SMOKING HISTORY 1- TO 3-PACKS OF CIGARETTES A DAY,
FOR NEARLY 40 YEARS, HOW THAT CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY WAS A
CAUSE IN THIS CASE.
NOW, THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES THEY BROUGHT YOU
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
61 DR. FURMAN. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO SAY ABOUT
DR. FURMAN. HE DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO YOU ABOUT
THE SAME THINGS DR. BURNS ALREADY TOLD YOU ABOUT. HE AGREED
SMOKING WAS A MAJOR RISK FACTOR FOR CORONARY HEART DISEASE.
AGREED MR. HARRIS WAS A HEAVY SMOKER, THAT HE WAS A HEAVY
SMOKER WHEN HE GOT THE CORONARY HEART DISEASE. AGREED THAT
WHEN YOU START SMOKING YOUNG YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET IT.
AND HE AGREED -- THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT, HE AGREED IF HE
QUIT SMOKING IN 1980, HIS RISK WOULD HAVE DECLINED
SIGNIFICANTLY. MEANING, IT MADE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION.
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW DR. FURMAN GOT FROM ALL THAT TO COME IN
HERE AND SAY IT DIDN'T CAUSE IT. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
AT ALL. THE COURT WILL INSTRUCT YOU, YOU CAN DISREGARD
ANYTHING AND ALL OF HIS TESTIMONY IF YOU WANT TO.
NOW, IF IN DELIBERATIONS SOMEONE SAYS, "WELL, BUT
MR. HARRIS HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER RISKS FACTORS FOR HEART
DISEASE," TELL THEM, "OF COURSE. NO KIDDING. THAT'S WHAT
DR. BURNS TOLD YOU. NO QUESTION." BUT REMIND THEM WHAT
DR. BURNS TOLD YOU AND THAT IS IF ALL THOSE THINGS, ALL THOSE
RISK FACTORS OF HEART DISEASE IF YOU TAKE OFF SMOKING FROM
THAT LIST, HIS RISK OF GETTING HEART DISEASE GOES DOWN
50 PERCENT. THAT'S SUBSTANTIAL. PERIOD. IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL
CONTRIBUTION.
AND AGAIN, IF DURING DELIBERATIONS SOMEONE SAYS TO
YOU, "WELL, THERE WERE OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR THAT ORAL
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
62 CAVITY CANCER," AGAIN, DR. BURNS SAID IF -- THAT'S RIGHT.
ABSOLUTELY. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT THAT'S NOT THE -- THE
QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER CIGARETTE SMOKING OR HIS ADDICTION TO
SMOKING WAS THE ONLY CAUSE. IT CAN WORK TOGETHER IN A
COMBINATION OF OTHER CAUSES JUST SO LONG AS IT CONTRIBUTED,
MADE A DIFFERENCE.
REMIND THEM ALSO WE PUT UP WHAT THE NATIONAL CANCER
INSTITUTE SAID AND THAT IS THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING -- I'M
SORRY, MOST ORAL CANCERS, LIKE THE ONE MR. HARRIS HAD, MORE
ORAL CANCERS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CIGARETTE SMOKING. REMEMBER
IT SAID THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECT, LARGE. REMIND THEM OF
THAT IF ANYONE IN DELIBERATIONS IS WORRIED ABOUT THE OTHER
RISK FACTORS.
AGAIN, I HATE TO REPEAT MYSELF, BUT YOU ARE ALLOWED
TO THINK MORE THAN ONE THING CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED. THAT'S
FINE. DR. BURNS TOLD YOU THAT, BUT IF YOU FIND THAT
MR. HARRIS' ADDICTION TO CIGARETTES, THE CIGARETTES HE SMOKED
FOR 30 YEARS, 40 YEARS, EVEN IF YOU FIND THAT WAS ONE OF THE
THINGS, JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAUSED, MORE LIKELY RIGHT
THAN WRONG EVEN BY A LITTLE BIT, THEN YOU HAVE TO FIND ON
QUESTION 2 -- I'M SORRY, QUESTION 3, YOU HAVE TO FIND IN OUR
FAVOR ON BOTH.
ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON. IF YOU ANSWER THESE
QUESTIONS AND YOU FOUND THAT MR. HARRIS IS A MEMBER OF THE
ENGLE CLASS, MEANING HE'S PART OF THIS GROUP OF SMOKERS THAT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
63 GET THE BENEFIT OF ALL THOSE FINDINGS THAT JURY MADE BEFORE
YOU, YOU SHOULD PULL OUT YOUR ENGLE FINDINGS. THOSE ARE
GOING TO BE IN INSTRUCTION 16, I THINK. THIS IS WHAT THE
OTHER JURY FOUND.
ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO READ THESE ALL TO YOU.
YOU'LL HAVE THEM BACK THERE WITH YOU. BUT THESE ARE THE KEY
SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANT FINDINGS THAT ONCE YOU FIND MR. HARRIS
IS PART OF THIS CLASS, THESE ARE GOING TO APPLY IN THIS CASE
AND YOU'RE GOING TO USE THEM IN DECIDING THE REST OF THESE
QUESTIONS.
MR. COFER: OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. MAY WE APPROACH
BRIEFLY?
THE COURT: I'LL SEE YOU AT SIDEBAR BRIEFLY. YOU
MAY STAND IF YOU WISH.
(SIDEBAR CONFERENCE HELD.)
MR. COFER: I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING. I
BELIEVE NO. 3 WAS EXCLUDED.
THE COURT: YES. YOU WEREN'T HERE.
MR. COFER: THEY DISPLAYED NO. 3. THEY SHOULDN'T
HAVE.
THE COURT: JUST TAKE A MARKER OVER --
MR. COFER: SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
MS. LONDON: THAT'S FINE.
MR. BIELBY: ALL OUR DEMONSTRATIVES ARE BASED ON
PRIOR DRAFTS, AND SINCE THE SEQUENCING CHANGE THIS MORNING,
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
64 IN THE ORDER OF DEFENDANTS, IT'S A NON-SUBSTANTIVE POINT, BUT
ALL OF OUR DEMONSTRATIONS ARE GOING TO USE THE DIFFERENT
ORDER.
THE COURT: YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM IF THE
DEFENDANTS ARE OUT OF ORDER ON THE DISPLAY, YOU DON'T OBJECT,
DO YOU?
ALL COUNSEL: NO.
THE COURT: YOU'RE FINE WITH THAT. OKAY.
(BACK BEFORE THE JURY.)
THE COURT: JUST SO YOU KNOW, THERE'S A TECHNICAL
PROBLEM. THERE WAS A MATTER DELETED IN THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS
THAT WE JUST DEBATED BEFORE YOU CAME IN THIS MORNING AND THAT
HADN'T BEEN MODIFIED YET. THAT'S WHAT THE ISSUE IS HERE.
MS. LONDON: LET'S PUT THAT BACK UP. THESE ARE THE
ENGLE FINDINGS. THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WILL APPLY IN THIS
CASE. SO STUDY THEM CAREFULLY AND REMIND EACH OTHER YOU
CAN'T QUESTION THESE. THESE ARE THE LAW. THESE HAVE ALREADY
BEEN DECIDED AND THEY WILL APPLY. OKAY. SO YOU CAN TAKE
THAT DOWN, AND WE'LL GO INTO THOSE A LITTLE BIT MORE LATER.
QUESTION 4, THE NEXT QUESTION. ALL RIGHT. THE
NEXT QUESTION IS WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF HAS PROVED THAT THIS
IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SMOKING CIGARETTES MANUFACTURED
BY THE FOLLOWING DEFENDANTS WAS A LEGAL CAUSE OF DISEASE OR
DISEASES NOT RESULTING IN MR. HARRIS' DEATH? OKAY. THIS
VERDICT FORM IS KIND OF LONG AND CUMBERSOME AND THAT'S FOR
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
65 LEGAL REASONS YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT. BUT THERE ARE GOING
TO BE SOME QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH DISEASES THAT
CAUSED MR. HARRIS' DEATH, THE LUNG CANCER, AND THE ONES THAT
DIDN'T. SO A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE JUST GOING TO BE
DUPLICATIVE QUESTIONS. ONE WILL HAVE TO DO WITH THE DISEASES
THAT DIDN'T RESULT IN HIS DEATH, AND THOSE WILL BE DEFINED
FOR YOU, AND THE ONES THAT DID, THE LUNG CANCER. OKAY. SO
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM IN GROUPS BECAUSE THEY ARE
REALLY THE SAME, THE SAME ISSUES, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW YOU'LL
HAVE TO DECIDE FOR BOTH.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS, WHETHER MR. HARRIS'
SMOKING OF EACH MANUFACTURED CIGARETTES WAS A LEGAL CAUSE.
THERE IT IS AGAIN THE WORD "LEGAL CAUSE," WHETHER IT
CONTRIBUTED, WHETHER IT WAS A CAUSE, DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE
ONLY CAUSE, WHETHER IT WAS A CAUSE, MADE A DIFFERENCE,
CONTRIBUTED.
SO YOU HEARD FROM MRS. HARRIS AND YOU HEARD FROM
THEIR NEIGHBOR MR. JENNINGS, ABOUT THE BRANDS THAT MR. HARRIS
SMOKED ON A REGULAR BASIS OVER THE YEARS. AND THERE IS NO
DISPUTE AT ALL THAT THESE BRANDS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT THEY
WERE MANUFACTURED BY THESE CIGARETTE COMPANIES. YOU'LL
HAVE -- YOU WERE TOLD ABOUT THAT. MR. BYRD HE STOOD UP AND
HE READ THOSE STIPULATIONS OF FACT TO YOU. THAT'S NOT IN
DISPUTE.
DR. BURNS EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT IT WAS ALL -- THAT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
66 IT WAS ALL THE CIGARETTES. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM THAT
CAUSED AND CONTRIBUTED TO MR. HARRIS' ADDICTION, DISEASES AND
DEATH.
WE EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT IT WAS PHILIP MORRIS'
CIGARETTES, LORILLARD'S CIGARETTES AND R.J. REYNOLDS'
CIGARETTES, EVERY CIGARETTE HE SMOKED CAUSED, CONTRIBUTED,
MADE A DIFFERENCE IN MR. HARRIS' MULTIPLE DISEASES AND DEATH.
THE DEFENDANTS DIDN'T BRING YOU ANYONE TO SAY ANYTHING
DIFFERENT AT ALL.
NOW, IF SOMEBODY IN DELIBERATIONS THEY SAY, "WELL,
I'M NOT SURE. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG HE SMOKED ANY
PARTICULAR BRAND. WE DON'T KNOW THAT." REMIND THEM THAT --
WHAT DR. BURNS SAID THAT EACH ONE OF THE CIGARETTES MADE A
CONTRIBUTION, ADDED MORE NICOTINE TO HIS BRAIN THROUGH THE
NICOTINE RECEPTORS, ADDED MORE DISEASE TO HIS AIRWAYS,
NARROWED HIS BLOOD VESSELS, FROZE THE SCILLAE THAT DEFEND HIS
LUNGS. EVERY SINGLE CIGARETTE MADE A CONTRIBUTION.
NOW THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PLACE ON THE VERDICT FORM
FOR YOU TO DIVIDE UP HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY AMONG THE
CIGARETTE COMPANIES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
HERE. THIS PART IS JUST IF MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG,
EVEN IF JUST BY A HAIR, EVEN BY A HAIR, THAT THESE COMPANIES'
CIGARETTES MADE A CONTRIBUTION TO DISEASE, YOU HAVE TO FIND
FOR US IN OUR FAVOR AND CHECK THE ANSWER YES. IT SHOULD BE,
"YES, YES AND YES," ON THIS QUESTION. AND THAT WILL GO SAME
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
67 FOR QUESTION 6. RIGHT. SO THIS IS FOR THE DISEASES THAT
DIDN'T CAUSE HIS DEATH, AND QUESTION 6 WILL BE FOR THE ONES
THAT CAUSED HIS LUNG CANCER AND DEATH.
NOW, DR. BURNS EXPLAINED TO YOU HOW IT WAS THAT
MR. HARRIS' ADDICTION TO CIGARETTES CAUSED MR. HARRIS' LUNG
CANCER AND DEATH. HE EXPLAINED TO YOU HOW IT IS THAT THE
CHEMICALS THAT CAME INTO HIS BODY OVER MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE,
MULTIPLE DECADES ERODED THE DEFENSES IN HIS LUNGS, GOT RID OF
THE NATURAL DEFENSES, GOT INTO HIS BLOOD STREAM, MUTATED,
CHANGED, BECAME A CANCER, SPREAD TO HIS BONES AND SPREAD TO
HIS BRAIN. HE EXPLAINED TO YOU HOW IT IS THAT THE SMOKING OF
THESE CIGARETTES CAUSED HIS DEATH. HE ALSO EXPLAINED TO YOU
THAT 85 TO 90 PERCENT OF LUNG CANCER IS CAUSED BY SMOKING.
SO THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT LUNG CANCER IS CAUSED BY
SMOKING.
NOW, IF IN DELIBERATIONS SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, HE
STOPPED SMOKING 12 YEARS BEFORE THAT LUNG CANCER. I CAN'T BE
SURE." REMIND THEM WHAT DR. BURNS SAID THAT EVEN AFTER HE
HAD BEEN STOPPED FOR 12 YEARS, HIS RISK WAS 3- TO 400-PERCENT
HIGHER THAN THAT OF A NONSMOKER, AND, BY THE WAY, THAT
MR. HARRIS HAD NO OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR LUNG CANCER. AGAIN,
THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES DID NOT BRING YOU ONE WITNESS, NOT
ONE TO TELL YOU OTHERWISE. REMEMBER THEY HAD A BOARD
CERTIFIED INTERNAL MEDICINE DOCTOR SITTING IN THAT CHAIR WHO
HAS GIVEN OPINIONS ON PULMONARY DISEASES BEFORE, CURIOUS THEY
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
68 DIDN'T BRING HIM IN TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT. SO THE ANSWER
IS TO THOSE QUESTIONS, "YES, YES AND YES." EVERY CIGARETTE
CONTRIBUTED.
THE NEXT AREA, AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THESE
QUESTIONS TOGETHER, THE FOUR QUESTIONS ALL ARE AROUND THE
SAME TOPIC AND THAT'S FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT AND THE
CONSPIRACY, AND IT'S VERY TECHNICALLY DENSE, AND YOU'LL HAVE
THAT QUESTION BACK THERE. THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ALL OF THESE
QUESTIONS IS WHETHER THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES' CONCEALMENT --
WHETHER THEIR FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT,
AND WHETHER THEIR AGREEMENT TO FRAUDULENTLY CONCEAL WHETHER
THAT WAS A CAUSE, A LEGAL CAUSE OF MR. HARRIS' INJURIES AND
DEATH, AND THERE WILL BE FOUR DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THAT GO TO
THAT ISSUE. SOME THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE DISEASES THAT
DIDN'T CAUSE HIS DEATH, AND SOME THAT DID, AND ONE QUESTION
ABOUT EACH COMPANY'S FRAUD AND THEIR CONCEALMENT, AND EACH
COMPANY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THIS CONSPIRACY, BUT THEY REALLY
ALL GO TOGETHER. SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM ALL THE
SAME.
NOW, GOOD NEW IS THERE ARE THINGS YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DECIDE. (IF YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE ENGLE FINDINGS, JEFF.)
OKAY. SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE. THE
CIGARETTE COMPANIES WE KNOW THEY CONCEALED OR OMITTED
MATERIAL INFORMATION NOT OTHERWISE KNOWN OR AVAILABLE.
KNOWING THAT THEY OMITTED -- KNOWING THAT THE CONCEALED OR
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
69 OMITTED INFORMATION WAS FALSE OR MISLEADING. OKAY. WE KNOW
THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE THAT. AND WE KNOW THAT THE
COMPANIES AGREED TO DO THIS TOGETHER WITH THE INTENTION THAT
THE PUBLIC AND SMOKERS WOULD RELY ON WHAT THEY SAID. THIS
HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED. REMIND EACH OTHER THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DECIDE THIS PART, AND THAT'S KEY.
SO IF SOMEBODY DURING DELIBERATIONS SAYS, "WELL,
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE READERS DIGEST ARTICLES, WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE THINGS OF WARNINGS ON PACKS, ALL THAT STUFF THAT CAME OUT
OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS, SURELY THERE WAS INFORMATION OUT
THERE IN THE PUBLIC THAT SMOKING COULD BE BAD FOR YOU, COULD
BE BAD TO QUIT." SO IF SOMEONE SAYS THAT DURING
DELIBERATIONS REMIND THEM, THIS CASE IS ABOUT WHAT WAS NOT
KNOWN, NOT AVAILABLE, THAT'S WHAT THIS CASE IS ABOUT.
AND HERE'S WHAT WAS NOT KNOWN OR AVAILABLE. NOBODY
OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRY KNEW THAT THESE FILTERS, THESE LIGHTS,
THESE LOW TAR CIGARETTES WERE GIMMICKS, NOT ANY SAFER,
WOULDN'T DELIVER ANY LESS TAR OR NICOTINE. QUITE TO THE
CONTRARY. THE PUBLIC COMPLETELY BELIEVED THE OPPOSITE AND SO
DID THE SURGEON GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY WERE ALL
FOOLED. NOBODY KNEW OUTSIDE OF THE INDUSTRY WHAT THEY WERE
DOING TO RIG THE CIGARETTES, TO MAKE THEM AS HARD TO QUIT AS
POSSIBLE. THEY KEPT ALL THAT UNDER WRAPS. NOBODY KNEW THAT.
NOBODY KNEW HOW THEY WERE DESIGNING THE CIGARETTES WITH THE
PH, AND THE OPTIMUM NICOTINE, AND ALL THE RIGGING THEY WERE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
70 DOING. THAT WAS ALL SECRET AND KEPT IN THEIR FILES.
AND NOBODY KNEW OUTSIDE OF THE INDUSTRY THAT THESE
COMPETITORS, THESE COMPETITORS WERE WORKING TOGETHER BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS TO DENY, AND DOUBT, AND LIE ABOUT WHAT THEY ALL
KNEW TO BE TRUE. NOBODY KNEW THAT OUTSIDE OF THE INDUSTRY.
THAT WAS NOT OTHERWISE KNOWN OR AVAILABLE. AND, OF COURSE,
NONE OF THAT CAME OUT UNTIL WHEN? UNTIL WHEN? UNTIL MR.
HARRIS ALREADY HAD BEEN PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO SMOKE, UNTIL ALL
THE DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE TO HIS BODY WAS ALREADY DONE.
SO THIS QUESTION, THIS QUESTION ABOUT CONCEALMENT, AND
CONSPIRACY AND ALL THAT, THE QUESTION ONLY IS WHETHER IT IS A
LEGAL CAUSE, A LEGAL CAUSE, DID IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE, DID IT
CONTRIBUTE?
SO THERE'S TWO WAYS, REALLY, THAT THESE OMISSIONS
AND CONCEALMENTS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I REALIZE ITS HARD
TO THINK ABOUT HOW A CONCEALMENT OR OMISSION OF FACT HOW DOES
THAT CAUSE A DISEASE. I THINK IT'S KIND OF A COMPLICATED AND
HARD THING TO THINK ABOUT. THEY WAY I LOOK AT IT IS, WHAT WE
DON'T KNOW CAN HURT YOU. RIGHT.
ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS IS WHAT IF IT WAS THE
OPPOSITE? WHAT IF THEY HAD COME CLEAN? WHAT IF THEY HAD
TOLD THE TRUTH BACK IN THE '50'S? WAY BACK HERE INSTEAD OF
GOING TO THE MEETING AT THE PLAZA HOTEL IN 1953 SAYING
MR. HARRIS -- WHAT IF THEY CAME CLEAN WHEN THEY KNEW THAT
THEIR CIGARETTES HAD CHEMICALS IN IT THEY COULDN'T TAKE OUT?
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
71 WHAT IF THEY CAME CLEAN THEN? WHAT IF THEY CAME CLEAN AND
THEY KNEW THAT FILTERS WERE JUST AN ILLUSION OF FILTRATION?
WHAT IF THEY CAME CLEAN THEN? WHAT IF THEY CAME CLEAN WHEN
THEY KNEW HOW ADDICTIVE THEIR CIGARETTES WERE? WHY DO PEOPLE
SMOKE "ADDICTION"? IF THEY HAD COME CLEAN BACK THEN, IF THEY
HAD COME CLEAN WITH ALL THESE POINTS ALONG THE WAY WOULD THAT
HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE? WELL, HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.
DR. BURNS WE ASKED HIM AND HE SHOWED US WHAT THE WORLD WOULD
LOOK LIKE, HOW DIFFERENT THE WORLD WOULD LOOK IF THEY HAD
COME CLEAN ON ANY OF THESE POINTS ALONG THE WAY, HOW MUCH
LESS DISEASE AND DEATH WE WOULD HAVE IN AMERICA. HE SHOWED
US THAT.
HOW DO WE KNOW? BECAUSE NOW THAT THEY CAN'T LIE
ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS SO MANY FEWER PEOPLE SMOKE. SO WE
KNOW THAT IT MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. NOW WOULD IT
HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE TO MR. HARRIS? I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE
LEARNED ABOUT HIM ABSOLUTELY IT WOULD HAVE. THIS WAS A MAN
WHO LOVED HIS FAMILY, PROVIDED FOR HIS FAMILY. THIS IS A MAN
WHO WANTED TO STOP SMOKING, TOLD HIS NEIGHBOR -- BY THE WAY,
HAS NO SKIN IN THIS GAME AT ALL -- TOLD HIS NEIGHBOR HOW MUCH
HE WANTED TO STOP AND HOW MUCH HE COULDN'T STOP. WE KNOW
THAT IF MR. HARRIS COULD HAVE STOPPED, IF HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN
-- WE ALSO KNOW HE WAS CONFUSED. AGAIN, HIS NEIGHBOR HAD
TALKED TO HIM, NO SKIN IN THE GAME, HE TOLD YOU HE WAS
CONFUSED AND DIDN'T KNOW THE RISK, DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
72 IT.
REMEMBER WHAT DR. BURNS SAID, THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN,
THIS WHOLE THING, THIS WAS DIRECTED EXCLUSIVELY AT PEOPLE
LIKE MR. HARRIS. PEOPLE WHO WERE ADDICTED. PEOPLE WHO WOULD
BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS NOTION OF DOUBT AND CONTROVERSY
BECAUSE OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE, AND HE EXPLAINED THAT WHOLE
CONCEPT TO YOU. MR. HARRIS WAS SQUARELY IN THE TARGET OF
WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN OF DOUBT
AND DENIAL. WOULD IT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE TO HIM IF THEY
HAD COME CLEAN WHEN IT WAS EASIER FOR HIM TO QUIT WAY BACK
WHEN? ABSOLUTELY IT WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE ONLY THING THAT CAUSED
HIS DISEASE, BY THE WAY. YOU CAN FIND OTHER THINGS CAUSED
HIS DISEASE. FOR EXAMPLE, ADDICTION. FOR EXAMPLE, OTHER
THINGS. SO LONG AS THE FACT THAT THEY LIED, AND HIDE, AND
DENIED, AND WORKED TOGETHER TO DO IT AS LONG AS THAT WAS A
CAUSE, MADE A DIFFERENCE, CONTRIBUTED, THEN YOU HAVE TO FIND
ON THIS QUESTION IN OUR FAVOR, "YES, YES, AND YES," ON
QUESTIONS 8, 10, 12, AND 14, I THINK.
AND BY THE WAY, YOU'RE -- WELL -- ALL RIGHT. NOW,
THERE'S A SECOND PART OF THESE QUESTIONS, THOUGH, THAT YOU
ALSO HAVE TO ANSWER. (CAN YOU PUT THAT UP?) ABOUT THE
MAY 5TH, 1982 -- ALL RIGHT. SO FOR EACH OF THOSE QUESTIONS
THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE A QUESTION TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE
LIES AND THE CONCEALMENT, WHETHER THAT HAPPENED BEFORE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
73 MAY 5, 1982 OR AFTER. AGAIN, DON'T CONCERN YOURSELF WITH
THAT DATE, WHY IT'S THERE. IT'S FOR LEGAL REASONS. BUT WE
SHOWED YOU THAT THE TRUTH IS RIGHT UP HERE. THEY LIED BEFORE
MAY 5TH, 1982. THEY LIED AFTER MAY 5TH, 1982, ABOUT WHETHER
THEIR CIGARETTES CAUSED CANCER, ABOUT WHETHER FILTERS, LIGHTS
AND LOW TAR CIGARETTES WERE ANY SAFER, AND WHETHER CIGARETTES
WERE ADDICTIVE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER, ALL ALONG THE WAY
UNTIL 1999 WHEN THEY HAD TO COME CLEAN, AT LEAST ON SOME OF
IT.
AND MR. HARRIS WE KNOW HE KEPT SMOKING THOSE FILTER
CIGARETTES, THE LIGHTS, THE LOW TAR CIGARETTES, HE KEPT
SMOKING ALL THOSE BACK IN 1982 AS WELL. AND WE KNOW HE WAS
CONFUSED ABOUT THE RISK AND HE TALKED TO HIS NEIGHBOR ABOUT
THAT AND WE THINK THAT HAPPENED IN THE '80'S AS WELL. SO THE
ANSWER TO THIS WOULD BE, "YES, YES, YES, AND YES," MORE
LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG. I'M SORRY, IT'S NOT, "YES," IT'S
BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER. FOR EACH ONE OF THESE DEFENDANTS.
NONE OF THEM CAME CLEAN, BY THE WAY, IN THE '80'S.
ALL RIGHT. (YOU CAN TAKE THAT DOWN.) OKAY. SO AT
THE BEGINNING OF THIS CASE I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD HAVE --
I'D HAVE TO SHOW YOU THE HARMS AND THE LOSSES BECAUSE AT THE
END OF THIS CASE YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AN AMOUNT THAT
WOULD FAIRLY COMPENSATE FOR HARMS AND LOSSES. HARMS AND
LOSSES ONLY, NOT SYMPATHY, OF COURSE WE CAN'T BRING
MR. HARRIS BACK, AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON BUT HARMS AND
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
74 LOSSES. SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO PUT A DOLLAR FIGURE
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT JUSTICE CAN DO, THAT'S WHAT WE CAN DO
HERE, THAT'S WHAT JUSTICE REQUIRES.
NOW, COMPENSATION MEANS AN AMOUNT TO MAKE-UP FOR.
NOT TOO MUCH, NOT TOO LITTLE. AN AMOUNT THAT JUST
COMPENSATES. AN AMOUNT THAT MAKES-UP FOR. SO LET'S START
WITH ONE NUMBER TO HELP YOU FIGURE THIS OUT, AND THAT'S THE
MEDICAL BILLS. AND THE JUDGE TOLD YOU THAT WAS GOING TO COME
INTO EVIDENCE AND YOU'LL HAVE IT BACK THERE.
HERE'S WHAT -- THE MEDICAL BILLS THAT WE HAVE.
THIS IS A SUMMARY OF THE MEDICAL BILLS IN THIS CASE. THE
TOTAL NUMBER $1.4 MILLION AND SOME CHANGE. THAT'S WHAT THE
MEDICAL BILLS ARE IN THIS CASE. THAT'S FOR THE
HOSPITALIZATIONS, THAT'S FOR THE HOSPITAL BEDS, THE
EQUIPMENT, THE HOSPICE WORKERS, ALL OF THAT YOU HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT. SO THAT'S ONE FIGURE OF THE LOSSES AND THE HARMS IN
THIS CASE. BUT OF COURSE THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT,
THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT.
IF YOU COULD PUT UP A PIE CHART FOR HOW TO THINK
ABOUT IT. ALL RIGHT. SO THERE'S THE MEDICAL BILLS. THAT'S
A PIECE OF THE PIE. BUT THE JUDGE IS ALSO GOING TO INSTRUCT
YOU THERE IS OTHER ELEMENTS OF DAMAGES THAT YOU HAVE TO
CONSIDER, PAIN AND SUFFERING, DISABILITY, MENTAL ANGUISH,
INCONVENIENT, LOSS OF CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT OF LIFE. THESE
ARE ALL THE FACTORS THAT YOU'LL NEED TO CONSIDER IN COMING UP
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
75 WITH AMOUNT THAT FAIRLY COMPENSATES MR. HARRIS FOR HIS LOSS.
NOW, I WANT TO BE CLEAR THERE ARE TWO DAMAGES HERE.
THERE IS MR. HARRIS' HARMS AND LOSSES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THAT FIRST. THEN THERE WILL BE MRS. HARRIS' HARMS AND
LOSSES, AND THERE WILL BE TWO SEPARATE NUMBERS ON YOUR
VERDICT FORM. LET'S TALK ABOUT MR. HARRIS' HARMS AND LOSSES,
BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS. THE WAY TO
THINK ABOUT IT IS LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT WAS THE HARM,
HOW LONG WAS THE HARM AND HOW MUCH DID THE HARM INTERFERE
WITH? OKAY.
SO LET'S START WITH HOW BAD WAS THE HARM? IMAGINE
IF SOMEBODY CAUSED YOU TO SPRAIN YOUR ANKLE. OKAY. IT HURT
A LOT. YOU WERE IN A CAST FOR A COUPLE -- MAYBE EVEN A
COUPLE OF WEEKS. IT INTERFERED WITH YOUR ABILITY TO GO ABOUT
YOUR DAILY LIFE. MAYBE YOU COULDN'T DANCE AT A WEDDING.
THESE ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE COMPENSATED, BUT NOT A LOT.
THIS IS A LOWER KIND OF HARM. THIS IS THE KIND OF HARM WHERE
YOU HAVE TO COME IN AND TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT WOULD BE
SOMEWHERE IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. OKAY.
NOW LET'S MOVE UP THE SCALE. THE KIND OF HARM
WHERE, LET'S SAY, YOUR LEG IS CRUSHED, AND YOU'VE GOT PINS
AND NEEDLES IN YOUR LEG, AND YOU'RE LAID UP FOR, LET'S SAY,
EVEN A COUPLE OF YEARS WITH SURGERIES AND REHAB, AND IT
INTERFERES WITH YOUR ABILITY TO WORK. YOU CAN'T DO THE KINDS
OF THINGS YOU WANTED TO DO. YOU COULDN'T GO ON VACATIONS YOU
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
76 PLANNED OR SCHEDULED. YOU COULDN'T HELP OUT AROUND THE
HOUSE. THAT'S THE KIND OF HARM THAT'S A MIDLEVEL KIND OF
HARM. THAT CERTAINLY TAKES MORE MONEY TO MAKE UP FOR THAT
KIND OF HARM. THAT'S A COUPLE $100,000.
ALL RIGHT. NOW WE HAVE TO GO TO THE TOP OF THE
SCALE, TO THE WORST KIND OF HARM. THE KIND OF HARM WHERE YOU
CAN'T TALK, WHERE YOU CAN'T WALK, OR YOUR BRAIN IS STILL
ALERT BUT YOU CAN'T COMMUNICATE, YOU CAN'T GET ACROSS EVEN
HOW MUCH PAIN YOU FEEL. YOU CAN'T BE THE DAD YOU WANT TO BE.
YOU LOSE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUR FAMILY. IT TAKES AWAY
THE ONE THING THAT ALL OF US, I KNOW ALL OF US PLAN FOR AND
DREAM ABOUT, AND THAT'S YOUR RETIREMENT. IT TAKES THAT ALL
AWAY. IT INTERFERES WITH YOUR LIFE IN THE MOST POSSIBLE KIND
OF WAY, AND THE KIND OF HARM THAT'S PERMANENT, FOREVER, FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL
ABOUT THAT. YOU HEARD ALL ABOUT IT, BUT THIS IS THE HIGHEST
KIND OF HARM. THE KIND OF HARM WHERE I HAVE TO ASK YOU FOR A
VERDICT, I TOLD YOU, WAS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT. THIS IS
THE KIND OF HARM, TO MAKE UP FOR THAT, WELL THAT'S IN THE
MILLIONS.
SO THIS IS -- I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THAT
MR. HARRIS SUFFERED, ALL THE DISEASES THAT HE HAD, ALL THE
DAMAGE AND EVERYTHING YOU HEARD ABOUT IN THIS CASE, I
SUGGEST, WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT THE MEDICAL BILLS AND THE REST
OF IT, IT WILL ADD UP TO ABOUT $9 MILLION, BUT, OF COURSE,
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
77 THAT'S UP TO YOU. IT COULD BE MORE, IT COULD BE LESS BASED
ON THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU HEARD THAT WE PROVED MORE LIKELY
RIGHT THAN WRONG IS FAIR, JUST COMPENSATION FOR THIS KIND OF
HARM.
ALL RIGHT. NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT MRS. HARRIS FOR A
MOMENT. IT'S THE SAME ANALYSIS. HOW BAD WAS THE HARM? HOW
LONG WAS THE HARM? HOW MUCH DID IT INTERFERE WITH? OKAY.
NOW, LET'S SAY THAT SOMEBODY SPRAINED -- SOMEBODY
CAUSES YOUR SPOUSE TO SPRAIN HIS ANKLE AND THAT'S HARD. YOU
HAVE TO SEE HIM IN THE PAIN, AND YOU HAVE TO HELP OUT EXTRA
AROUND THE HOUSE, DO MORE THINGS. IT INTERFERES WITH YOUR
LIVES. MAYBE YOU HAVE TO POSTPONE A VACATION. THAT'S A
LOSS, A SMALL ONE. THE KIND OF ONE THAT FALLS LOWER ON THE
SCALE, MAYBE A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS.
ALL RIGHT. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT A MIDLEVEL KIND OF
HARM. LET'S SAY SOMEONE CAUSES YOUR HUSBAND TO BE IN A COMA.
MR. COFER: YOUR HONOR, THIS IS ALL VIOLATING THE
GOLDEN RULE. IT'S IMPROPER ARGUMENT.
THE COURT: REPHRASE, IF YOU WOULD. CONTINUE.
MS. LONDON: SURE. LET'S SAY SOMEBODY, UM, INJURES
SOMEONE ELSE'S SPOUSE AND THEY SEE -- AND THAT SPOUSE HAS TO
GO INTO A COMA, THAT'S THE KIND OF HARM THAT'S MUCH, MUCH
WORSE, RIGHT? THIS PERSON LOSES THEIR SPOUSE FOR SEVERAL
YEARS, IS WORRIED ABOUT THEM. THEY CAN'T HELP AROUND THE
HOUSE, LOSES THEIR COMPANIONSHIP, LOSES THEIR TIME AND
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
78 AFFECTION FOR A COUPLE YEARS. THAT'S A MIDLEVEL KIND OF
HARM. THAT'S CERTAINLY THE KIND OF HARM THAT REQUIRES A
COUPLE -- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.
THEN THERE'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF HARM, THE KIND OF
HARM YOU TAKE AWAY SOMEONE'S HUSBAND FOR THE REST OF THEIR
LIVES, YOUR HUSBAND OF NEARLY 40 YEARS, TAKE AWAY THEIR
COMPANIONSHIP. THE KIND OF HARM WHERE YOU HAVE TO SEE THEM
SUFFER, WASTE AWAY IN THE HOSPICE BED. YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
EXCEPT SIT WITH YOUR OWN GUILT AND FEEL BAD THAT MAYBE YOU
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH ANY SUFFERING THAT HE HAD, AND THAT
YOU DIDN'T HAVE HIM WITH YOU. AND THE JUDGE -- AS YOU'LL SEE
BACK IN EXHIBIT 400 -- WHAT'S THE EXHIBIT, NO. 13 --
MR. BYRD: 16.
MS. LONDON: 1316. THAT WILL BE THE MORTALITY
TABLES THAT WILL HELP YOU FIGURE OUT HOW LONG IT IS THAT
MR. HARRIS AND MRS. HARRIS WOULD HAVE LIVED TOGETHER HAD THIS
NOT HAPPENED TO HIM. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IT WAS AT LEAST
12.4 YEARS. YOU WILL SEE THAT. THERE IT IS. THIS IS THE
LIFE TABLE THAT YOU'LL SEE. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN
CONSIDER THAT AT AGE 72 HE HAD 12.44 MORE YEARS TO LIVE IF
THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN TO HIM. SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL THE
HARMS AND ALL THE LOSSES TO MRS. HARRIS IN THIS CASE, THE
HIGHEST LEVEL KIND OF HARM THAT YOU HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT,
CONSIDER THE YEARS THAT THEY LOST TOGETHER, AND THE TIME HE
WAS IN HOSPICE AND SHE HAD TO WATCH HIM SUFFER, AND ALL THEY
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
79 WENT THROUGH, I SUGGEST TO YOU, IN THIS VERY HIGH LEVEL KIND
OF HARM, I SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THIS TOGETHER 12.44 MILLION
FOR ALL THE TIME THEY WOULD HAD LEFT, AND 1 MILLION FOR THE
TIME THAT THEY LOST IN THAT HOSPICE. BUT AGAIN, THIS IS UP
TO YOU. WHAT YOU THINK THE DAMAGE SHOWS, THE HARMS AND
LOSSES. WHAT WE PROVED MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN WRONG. THAT
NUMBER WILL BE COMPLETELY UP TO YOU.
NOW, IF IN DELIBERATIONS SOMEBODY SAYS, "WELL, WE
JUST CAN'T BRING HIM BACK, OR THIS SEEMS LIKE WAY TOO MUCH
MONEY FOR ONE PERSON, OR AWARDS LIKE THIS, THIS MIGHT DRIVE
UP THE COST OF EVERYTHING FOR THE REST OF US, OR MIGHT
ENCOURAGE MORE LAWSUITS," REMIND THEM THOSE ARE OUTSIDE
REASONS. THAT'S NOT HARMS AND LOSSES.
IN FACT, THERE IS A JURY INSTRUCTION ON THIS. JURY
INSTRUCTION NO. 2. IT SAYS THIS: "YOU ARE TO PERFORM THE
DUTY WITHOUT BIAS OR PREJUDICE. THE LAW DOES NOT PERMIT
JURORS TO BE GOVERNED BY SYMPATHY, PREJUDICE OR PUBLIC
OPINION. THE PARTIES AND THE PUBLIC EXPECT THAT YOU WILL
CAREFULLY AND IMPARTIALLY CONSIDER ALL THE EVIDENCE, FOLLOW
THE LAW AND REACH A JUST VERDICT NO MATTER THE CONSEQUENCES."
SO REMIND THE JURORS THAT. AND IF SOMEBODY INSISTS ON
FOLLOWING AN OUTSIDE REASON, WHETHER IT'S TOO MUCH MONEY FOR
ONE PERSON, OR WHETHER IT'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE MORE LAWSUITS,
OR WE CAN'T BRING HIM BACK, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO, I WANT
YOU TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND TELL THE JUDGE, "I'M WORRIED
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
80 THAT SOMEONE IS NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW." YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO BE ON A JURY THAT FOLLOWS THE LAW, AND I BELIEVE THAT
EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL DO THAT.
ALL RIGHT. NOW, I WANT TO GO BACK, AND THERE'S TWO
QUESTIONS, AND THIS IS WHERE I TOLD YOU LATER ON YOU GET TO
DECIDE HOW MUCH FAULT, HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY TO ALLOCATE
AMONG THE PARTIES. THAT'S QUESTIONS 5 AND QUESTION 7. AND
THIS ASKS YOU WHAT PERCENTAGE OF RESPONSIBILITY GOES TO EACH
SIDE. AND AGAIN, THIS WILL BE FOR THE DISEASES THAT DIDN'T
CAUSE HIS DEATH, AND THEN, THE ONES FOR THE LUNG CANCER AND
CAUSES HIS DEATH.
EVER SINCE -- FROM THE TIME WE'RE LITTLE WE LEARN
THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF AND FOR OTHERS, TAKE
REASONABLE CARE TO AVOID HARM TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS. AND IF
YOU DON'T, THEN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HARM. SO I WANT
TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS. IF YOU'RE
A PEDESTRIAN AND YOU DON'T LOOK BOTH WAYS AND YOU JUST RUN
OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND A BUS DRIVER IS COMING YOUR
WAY, CAN'T SEE YOU AND YOU GET HIT, WELL, YOU'RE 100 PERCENT
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. YOU DIDN'T LOOK BOTH WAYS. YOU DIDN'T
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
NOW, IMAGINE IF THAT BUS DRIVER IS TEXT MESSAGING
AND DOESN'T SEE YOU. YOU DON'T LOOK BOTH WAYS AND BOTH OF
YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS HARM, WELL, THEN BOTH OF YOU,
50/50, RIGHT?
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
81 NOW IMAGINE IF THIS BUS DRIVER KNOWS THIS
INTERSECTION IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS, KNOWS THAT THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE RUNNING INTO THE ROAD THERE ARE KIDS, AND KNOWS THAT
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO TEXT IN THAT INTERSECTION BECAUSE OF
THAT, BUT THEY DO IT ANYWAY. NOW IT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE
60/40 ON THE BUS DRIVER AND THE PEDESTRIAN.
AND LET'S TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT STEP. LET'S SAY
THE BUS DRIVER HAS HIT TEN OTHER PEOPLE BEFORE, KNOWS, IN
THAT INTERSECTION HOW DANGEROUS IT IS AND TEXTS ANYWAY. NOW
WE'RE MOVING UP TO A LITTLE MORE FAULT, 75 PERCENT ON THAT
BUS DRIVER AND 25 PERCENT ON THE PERSON THAT'S WALKING IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.
AND THEN, WE GO EVEN FURTHER, LET'S SAY THAT BUS
DRIVER KNOWS THAT IT'S GOING TO KILL ONE OUT OF THREE PEOPLE
THAT WALK INTO THAT INTERSECTION AND HAS DONE IT HUNDREDS,
THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE, AND KNOWS THAT THE PEOPLE WALKING
IN THE INTERSECTION ARE VULNERABLE, AND EVEN WORSE, PUTS UP
BILLBOARDS ALL OVER TOWN THAT SAYS, "DON'T WORRY. COME INTO
THE INTERSECTION. IT'S SAFE. IT'S COOL." DRIVES THROUGH,
TEXTS ANYWAY AND KILLS ONE OUT OF THREE PEOPLE. THAT LOOKS A
LITTLE DIFFERENT. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WHERE THE BUS
DRIVER NOW HAS ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE HARM.
AND SO, WELL, THAT'S -- THAT EXAMPLE, THAT'S NOT
EVEN AS BAD AS WHAT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES DID, AND YOU
HEARD ALL ABOUT WHAT THEY DID. HOW THEY ENTICE PEOPLE TO
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
82 START SMOKING YOUNG. HOW THEY RIG THE PRODUCTS TO MAKE IT AS
HARD AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO QUIT. KEEP THOSE EXIT DOORS
CLOSED, KEEP THEM PUSHING THAT LEVER LIKE A PAVLOV'S DOG,
CREATING DOUBT, TARGETING THESE PEOPLE, KNOWING THEY WERE
ADDICTED, KNOWING THAT THEY WERE VULNERABLE, CREATED ALL
THESE GIMMICK PRODUCTS, THE FILTERS, THE LIGHTS AND THE LOW
TARS AND SAY, "HEY, COME OVER HERE," INTERCEPTING YOU ON YOUR
WAY TO TRY TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND STILL LYING ALL THE
WAY THROUGH ALL OF IT. SO FAR MORE THAN 90 -- AT LEAST
90 PERCENT ON THEM.
BUT UNLIKE THEM WE'VE SAID LOOK AT MR. HARRIS TOO.
WE ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. LOOK AT HIS ACTIONS TOO. AND
HERE'S WHAT YOU SAW. HE STARTED WHEN HE WAS 13, LONG BEFORE
THERE WERE ANY WARNINGS ON ANY PACKS. WHEN THERE WAS A
CULTURE OF SMOKING CREATED, SUSTAINED AND MAINTAINED BY
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THESE COMPANIES. AND WE KNOW THAT
HE SWITCHED TO FILTERED CIGARETTES, ULTRA LIGHT CIGARETTES,
LOW TAR CIGARETTES. WE KNOW HE DID ALL THAT. WE KNOW HE
HEARD THE KINDS OF THINGS THEY WERE SAYING OVER THE YEARS.
WE KNOW HE TOOK SOME STEPS TO TRY TO HELP HIMSELF WITH THOSE
PRODUCTS EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD NO BENEFIT AT
ALL. WE KNOW HE TRIED TO QUIT. WE KNOW HE PUT THE PATCH ON
AND HE MADE AN EFFORT.
NOW, MAYBE DID MR. HARRIS CLING TOO LONG TO THE
KINDS OF THINGS THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES WERE SAYING OVER THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
83 YEARS? MAYBE. COULD HE HAVE TRIED HARDER OR EVEN SOONER?
SURE. YOU SHOULD EVALUATE ALL THAT WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL --
HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY GOES ON HIM. BUT WHAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT, JUST LIKE THAT BUS DRIVER, WHAT STEPS DID THE
CIGARETTE COMPANIES TAKE TO AVOID HARM? WHAT DID THEY TAKE?
NOW, MR. HARRIS, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HIS RISK WAS
OF GETTING A DISEASE. HE DIDN'T KNOW. COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN
THAT HE HAD ONE OUT OF THREE CHANCE. WE'VE ALL SEEN PEOPLE
LIKE THIS, PEOPLE WHO SMOKE LIKE CHIMNEYS UNTIL THEY ARE
90 YEARS OLD AND DON'T GET SICK AT ALL. HE COULD HAVE BEEN
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. BUT HERE'S WHAT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES
KNEW. THEY WERE THE BUS DRIVERS. THEY KNEW THAT ONE OUT OF
THREE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DIE. IT WAS A CERTAINTY. THEY
KNEW THAT. WHAT DID THEY DO TO AVOID HARM? NOTHING.
NOTHING AT ALL. IN FACT, THEY MADE IT WORSE. NOT ONLY DID
THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY WERE KILLING PEOPLE, THEY DID MORE
TO GET REPLACEMENT SMOKERS TO FILL IN THE PEOPLE THEY WERE
KILLING ON THE ROAD.
THE COURT: FIVE MINUTES, COUNSEL.
MS. LONDON: THANK YOU. SO BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN YOU
ARE DECIDING HOW MUCH FAULT IN THIS CASE, AND THAT WILL BE
COMPLETELY UP TO YOU, IF ON THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES IT'S
THEIR BURDEN TO PROVE TO YOU HOW MUCH FAULT GOES ON
MR. HARRIS, AS FAR AS HOW YOU DIVIDE UP THE FAULT AMONG THE
REST OF THESE COMPANIES, FRANKLY, I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
84 SUGGEST ABOUT THAT. ALL THEIR CIGARETTES CAUSED, ALL OF
THEIR CIGARETTES CONTRIBUTED. THAT WILL BE UP TO YOU.
ALL RIGHT. AND THERE'S ONE LAST QUESTION THAT YOU
ALL WILL HAVE TO DECIDE. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, AGAIN, FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING. A BIG PART OF THIS CASE IS ABOUT
PUNISHMENT. IT'S ABOUT PUNITIVE DAMAGES. WE TALKED ABOUT
THIS WHEN YOU AND I WERE ALL TOGETHER ABOUT A WEEK-AND-A-HALF
AGO. AND THIS IS QUESTION 18. AND THIS IS WHETHER YOU FIND
BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE
WARRANTED AGAINST EACH OF THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES. AND I
JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU AND HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT
YOU WILL SEE IN THE INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT HOW TO FIGURE THIS
OUT.
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DECIDE. YOU NEED TO
LOOK AT WHETHER THIS CONDUCT WAS SO GROSS AND FLAGRANTE AS TO
SHOW A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE, AN ENTIRE LACK OF
CARE, THAT THE DEFENDANTS MUST HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUSLY
INDIFFERENT TO THE CONSEQUENCES, WHETHER THEY WERE RECKLESSLY
DISREGARDING THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC AND WHETHER
THIS WAS INTENTIONAL. THOSE ARE THE FOUR DIFFERENT -- AND
ONLY ONE OF THOSE, BY THE WAY, WE HAVE TO SHOW. NOT ALL OF
THEM. EVEN THOUGH, I THINK, NOT ONLY MORE LIKELY RIGHT THAN
WRONG, BEYOND THAT IT'S CERTAIN THAT WHAT THE CIGARETTE
COMPANIES DID WAS INTENTIONAL, IT WAS RECKLESS AND DEFINITELY
IN THE CONSCIOUS DISREGARD FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
85 CUSTOMERS. YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THAT FROM THE CIGARETTE
COMPANIES' OWN DOCUMENTS. YOU KNOW THE WORDS THEY SAID. YOU
SAW THEM ON VIDEO. WE HAD TO PUT THEM ON VIDEO AND BRING
THEM HERE TO SHOW YOU. WE WERE WORRIED THEY WOULDN'T BRING
ANYONE HERE AT ALL. THESE THINGS ALL SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
NO WITNESSES CAME IN HERE TO DISPUTE THAT WHAT THEY DID WAS
INTENTIONAL.
SO THE ENGLE FINDINGS THEMSELVES, THEY SAY IT RIGHT
THERE, THEY AGREED TO CONCEAL, AT THE BOTTOM IT SAYS, "WITH
THE INTENTION THAT THE SMOKERS AND PUBLIC WOULD RELY." AND
EVEN MR. HEIMAN, THAT VIDEO WE PLAYED AT THE VERY END, HE
TOLD YOU THAT THEY INTENDED FOR CUSTOMERS TO RELY ON WHAT
THEY SAID.
SO WE KNOW IT WAS INTENTIONAL. WAS IT RECKLESS?
WAS IT CONSCIOUSLY INDIFFERENT? WELL, THEY ENGINEERED THE
CIGARETTES TO KEEP PEOPLE HOOKED, TO STOP SALES FROM
DROPPING. THEY LIED. THEY PUT IN A CAMPAIGN OF DOUBT,
DENIAL AND REASSURANCE TO STOP THEIR SALES FROM GOING DOWN.
INTERCEPTED CUSTOMERS WHO WERE SMOKING TO KEEP THEIR SALES
FROM GOING DOWN. THAT'S OKAY TO RUN A BUSINESS IN AMERICA.
THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT'S FINE, MAKING A PROFIT,
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT THIS
WAY. YOU CAN'T DO IT THIS WAY. SO IT'S CLEAR THEIR ACTS
WERE INTENTIONAL.
WERE THEY RECKLESS? ABSOLUTELY. THEY KNEW SURE AS
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
86 I'M STANDING HERE THAT 1 TO 3 OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WERE GOING
TO DIE. EVEN THOUGH, BY THE WAY, THAT'S NOT A NUMBER THEY
KEEP CLOSE IN THEIR MIND, AS THEY TOLD YOU.
480,000 PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR.
MR. COFER: OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. FOR THE RECORD,
WILLIAMS/STATE FARM.
THE COURT: ALL RIGHT. OVERRULED. YOU MAY
CONTINUE.
MS. LONDON: DO THESE COMPANIES NEED TO BE
PUNISHED? ABSOLUTELY. FOR THE TOBACCO EPIDEMIC THAT WAS
CAUSED BY THEIR AGGRESSIVE TACTICS DELIBERATELY. SPEWED ON
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT CAUSED AN EPIDEMIC, AN EPIDEMIC THAT
TOOK THE LIVES OF 20 MILLION AMERICANS, INCLUDING MR. HARRIS.
AND THERE IS MORE. THEY DON'T JUST DESERVE TO BE
PUNISHED. IT'S ALSO NECESSARY TO DETER THEM. TO DETER THEM,
BY THE WAY, BECAUSE THEY STILL DON'T GET IT. THEY STILL
DON'T GET IT AT ALL. THEY WANT TO TAKE WHAT THEY DID OFF THE
TABLE. THEY CAME IN HERE AND SAID, "NICOTINE ADDICTION IS
NOT EVEN A PROBLEM. IT'S NOT EVEN A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM.
WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO MAKE OUR CIGARETTES ANY LESS
ADDICTIVE." DON'T ADMIT IT TODAY. DON'T ADMIT THEY STUDIED
AND MARKETED TO CHILDREN.
BY THE WAY, THAT WOMAN WHO CAME UP AND TOLD YOU,
"OH, WE DON'T MARKET TO KIDS." RIGHT. THAT'S THE SAME
COMPANY, BY THE WAY, "HIGH SCHOOL IS THE BASE OF OUR
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
87 BUSINESS." THEY DON'T GET IT. THEY DON'T ADMIT IT AT ALL.
SO IT'S NOT JUST TO DETER THEM BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY
NEED TO BE PUNISHED AND THEY CLEARLY NEED TO BE DETERRED.
BUT IT'S ALSO, BY THE WAY, A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL TO DETER ALL
COMPANIES SO NO OTHER COMPANIES CAN DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
YOU HAVE A VERY, VERY POWERFUL TOOL, AND A VERY IMPORTANT
JOB, AND VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY AND OTHER
MANUFACTURERS ARE LOOKING AT YOU. THEY WANT TO KNOW.
I WISH IT WERE SO. I WISH IT WERE SO THAT WE
DIDN'T NEED TO DETER COMPANIES FROM DOING THINGS LIKE THIS,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, WE NEED THIS KIND OF DETERRENCE TO SAY YOU
HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU KNOW IT.
YOU CAN'T CONCEAL IT. YOU CAN'T COVER IT UP. YOU CAN'T
WAIT, HOPE NO ONE WILL FIND OUT WHILE PEOPLE ARE DYING.
CAN'T DO IT. YOU NEED TO BE PLAIN AND CLEAR.
THE COURT: WE'RE AT ONE HOUR, COUNSEL.
MS. LONDON: AND FOR THAT, WE ASK THAT YOU FIND YES
ON ALL THREE OF THESE. THANK YOU.


MS. LONDON: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
GOOD MORNING. IT'S OKAY TO DEFEND YOURSELF WHEN
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE, YOU DO
WHAT WE ARE TAUGHT AS CHILDREN --
MS. BAKER: OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR, PRETRIAL RULING.
THE COURT: SEE YOU SIDEBAR BRIEFLY. I'M SORRY,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOU MAY STAND IF YOU WISH.
(SIDEBAR CONFERENCE HELD.)
THE COURT: THIS DOESN'T COME OFF YOUR TIME.
MS. LONDON: THANK YOU.
THE COURT: I'M SORRY, I'M NOT GETTING THE
OBJECTION.
MS. BAKER: I APOLOGIZE, YOUR HONOR. I SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT IT UP THE PRETRIAL RULING. THERE WAS A MOTION IN
LIMINE GRANTED IN DEFENDANTS' FAVOR THAT THEY CANNOT
CRITICIZE OUR RIGHT TO DEFEND OURSELVES IN THIS LAWSUIT.
THE COURT: I THINK EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO
DEFEND. WE CAN BE DEFENDING AN AMOUNT. SO LET'S GET OFF THE
TOPIC.
MS. BAKER: THERE SHOULDN'T BE A SUGGESTION THAT WE
CAN'T DEFEND OURSELVES --
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
159 COURT: RIGHT.
MS. LONDON: WELL, HOLD ON. EXCUSE ME. FIRST OF
ALL, THIS LAWYER HAS VIOLATED MORE THAN FOUR PRETRIAL RULINGS
DURING THIS ARGUMENT, DURING HER ARGUMENT ABOUT ARGUMENTS SHE
WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE. I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO COME UP AND
EXPLAIN THAT. BEYOND THAT, I'M NOT SAYING THEY SHOULDN'T BE
ALLOWED TO --
THE COURT: YOU CAN ARGUE THEY SHOULD BE
RESPONSIBLE, BUT THE ARGUMENT THAT THEY SHOULD COME IN AND
CONFESS, I'M NOT GOING TO PERMIT THAT. THAT'S THE RULING.
MR. COFER: ANOTHER THING IS THAT OUR DEFENDING IS
NOT CONTENDING FRAUD (INAUDIBLE). THAT'S NOT PART OF --
MS. BAKER: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
(BACK BEFORE THE JURY.)
THE COURT: YOU MAY CONTINUE.
MS. LONDON: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
IN THE LAST WEEK-AND-A-HALF YOU DIDN'T HEAR
ANYTHING FROM THESE CIGARETTE COMPANIES EXCEPT EXCUSES.
EVERYONE ELSE IS TO BLAME. IT WASN'T OUR CIGARETTES. IF IT
WAS OUR CIGARETTES, THEN IT'S NOT -- IT'S SOME OTHER
COMPANY'S CIGARETTES. AND EVEN IF IT'S THEIR CIGARETTES,
IT'S HIS FAULT FOR GETTING ADDICTED. EVEN IF ISN'T HIS
FAULT, IT'S MRS. HARRIS' FAULT FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO HELP
HIM. EVERYONE ELSE IN THE FAMILY, IT'S THEIR FAULT TOO. OH
WAIT, IT'S THE SURGEON GENERAL'S FAULT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
160 ONES THAT SAID THE LIGHTS, THE LOW TARS, THE FILTERS. THEY
DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO WARN PEOPLE. EVERYONE ELSE'S FAULT,
RIGHT. IT'S NOT THEM, LIKE THEY DIDN'T EVEN EXIST.
MR. COFER HE TOLD YOU HE DIDN'T COME IN HERE AND
BLAME MRS. HARRIS. WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD.
THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL THESE COMPANIES CAME UP AND TOLD YOU
SHE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO HELP. THEY BLAMED HER, EVEN
SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE
SOMETHING TO KILL HER HUSBAND, AND OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T
BRING ANY WITNESS TO PROVE THAT TO YOU. THEY JUST THREW IT
OUT THERE, PUT IT OUT HERE IN THIS COURTROOM, IN THIS
PRESTIGIOUS HALL OF JUSTICE AND PUT IT AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC
RECORD, A PUBLIC ACCUSATION, AN INSULT TO HER INJURY. SO I
HAD TO STAND UP AND I HAD TO OBJECT A LOT TO THAT, TO PROTECT
HER FROM THIS SMEAR TACTIC.
NOW, I TOLD YOU BEFORE THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO
BRING HIM BACK, AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO FIX, BUT
ACTUALLY THERE IS, BY COMING BACK WITH A VERDICT, A JUST
VERDICT AND EXPLAINING EXACTLY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE HERE.
EXPLAINING -- SHOWING EXACTLY WHO BEARS SOME RESPONSIBILITY
HERE, THAT CAN BRING BACK HER NAME, HER GOOD NAME THAT THEY
TARNISHED IN THIS COURT. SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
NOW, COUNSEL JUST GOT UP HERE AND SAID THIS IS A
CASE ABOUT ONE SMOKER. WELL, THAT'S TRUE. IT IS HOW MUCH
RESPONSIBILITY THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES BEAR FOR WHAT HAPPENED
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
161 TO THIS SMOKER AND HIS FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT I TOLD YOU FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING. THAT'S WHAT THIS CASE IS ABOUT. NO
OTHER JURY HAS HEARD ABOUT THE HARMS AND LOSSES, THE
EXTENSIVE HARMS AND LOSSES THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT IN THIS
TRIAL. NO OTHER JURY HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY TO COMPENSATE THIS
FAMILY.
CIGARETTE LAWYER -- COMPANY LAWYERS ALSO CAME UP
AND THEY WROTE 100 FAULT TO MR. HARRIS, BLAMING HIM
100 PERCENT. NOW, REMEMBER, THEY HAVE TO PROVE TO YOU, THEY
HAVE TO PROVE TO YOU THAT HE WAS UNREASONABLE. AND I THINK
IT'S INTERESTING, I THINK EARLIER IN THIS TRIAL THEY TOLD
YOU, WELL, HIS DECISIONS WERE RATIONAL. NOW THEY ARE SAYING
HE'S UNREASONABLE FOR BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS AND DOING EXACTLY
WHAT THEY TOLD HIM TO DO.
BEYOND THAT WE ALSO SHOWED YOU IN THIS TRIAL TO
COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES. COMPARE WITH OTHER MEN OF HIS
GENERATION WHO GREW UP WHEN HE DID, AT THE TIME HE DID IN THE
MIDST OF ALL OF THIS CONDUCT OF WHAT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES
WERE DOING. SO LET'S COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES, NOT JUST SOME
HYPOTHETICAL PEOPLE WHO QUIT, NOT 60 MILLION, OR THIS, THAT
OR THE OTHER THING. LET'S LOOK AT THE MEN AND COMPARE HIM
AGAINST THEM.
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS WHO YOU COMPARE HIM AGAINST,
MEN WHO GREW UP WHEN HE DID. LOOK AT THAT. ALMOST
70 PERCENT OF MEN OF HIS GENERATION WERE SMOKING. AND LOOK
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
162 HOW SLOWLY THAT LINE DECLINES. MORE THAN HALF, HALF OF THE
MEN OF HIS GENERATION WHO STARTED SMOKING WERE STILL SMOKING
EVEN WHEN MR. HARRIS FINALLY STOPPED AND COULD NO LONGER
SMOKE. SQUARELY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEN OF HIS GENERATION.
THAT'S WHO YOU COMPARE HIM TO. OTHER MEN EXPOSED TO THE SAME
MESSAGES, WHO HAD THE SAME POWER OF ADDICTION AT THAT TIME IN
THEIR LIVES. THAT'S WHO YOU COMPARE HIM TO. THEY HAVEN'T
SHOWN YOU ANYTHING ABOUT HOW HE WAS UNREASONABLE WHEN YOU
COMPARE HIM TO THE RIGHT SET OF PEOPLE. THANK YOU.
NOW, YOU HEARD ALSO A LOT DURING THIS TRIAL ABOUT
ALCOHOL. DR. KAPLAN WENT IN DETAIL ABOUT THAT. YOU HEARD
SOME TESTIMONY FROM A DEPOSITION OF MR. HARRIS' EX-WIFE.
APPARENTLY JUST TO REMIND YOU, "OH, YEAH, HE DRANK. OH,
YEAH."
THEN THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL THEY'VE COBBLED TOGETHER
A THEORY THAT, "WELL, HE QUIT DRINKING SO HE COULD HAVE QUIT
SMOKING, SO THEREFORE, WE ALL GO HOME." BUT I THINK THERE IS
ANOTHER WAY TO SEE THAT. MR. HARRIS WAS A STRONG MAN, BOAT
CAPTAIN. HE WORKED HARD. HE DID WHAT HE COULD TO PROVIDE
FOR HIS FAMILY.
HE TOLD HIS NEIGHBOR, "I WANT TO QUIT. I'M TRYING
TO QUIT. I CAN'T. I'M ADDICTED TO IT." SO I THINK THE WAY
TO LOOK AT THAT, ABOUT ALCOHOL, I THINK THAT GOES TO THE
POWER OF ADDICTION MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THE ADDICTION TO
NICOTINE.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
163 NOW, INTERESTINGLY COUNSEL FOR THE CIGARETTE
COMPANY HE SAID, "OH, IT'S JUST NOT TRUE, NOT TRUE AT ALL
THAT NICOTINE ADDICTION IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ALCOHOL
ADDICTION." WELL, I DON'T KNOW, WE DIDN'T HEAR ANY EVIDENCE
ABOUT THAT. CERTAINLY NO WITNESS CAME IN HERE AND COMPARED
THE ADDICTIVENESS OF THESE TWO SUBSTANCES. BUT HERE'S WHAT
WE DO KNOW, AND EVEN DR. KAPLAN AGREED WITH THIS. WE KNOW
THAT EVEN IF HE USED THE SAME TOOLS, THE SAME TOOLS THAT HE
USED 20 YEARS EARLIER, WE KNOW HOW LIKELY HIS SUCCESS OF
QUITTING WOULD BE. THAT'S WHAT WE DO KNOW. DR. KAPLAN
AGREED LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF QUIT ATTEMPTS SUCCEED. WHY
DON'T YOU PUT UP THAT SLIDE FOR US.
HE AGREED IT WAS LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT. THE
CURRENT SLIDE IT'S ONLY THREE PERCENT. SO EVEN IF HE USED
ALL THESE TOOLS THAT THESE COMPANIES CAME IN HERE AND KEPT
REMINDING YOU ABOUT, THAT'S HOW LIKELY HE WAS TO BE
SUCCESSFUL, THREE PERCENT. THAT'S THE POWER OF NICOTINE
ADDICTION. THAT'S THE EVIDENCE YOU HEARD IN THIS COURTROOM.
NOBODY CAME UP HERE WITH ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON ALCOHOL. SO
DON'T BE DISTRACTED ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. YOU CAN TAKE
THAT DOWN.
ALL RIGHT. AND COUNSEL TALKED ABOUT THERE BEING NO
CONSENSUS ON THE DEFINITION OF ADDICTION. SO WHAT DID -- WE
BROUGHT YOU THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERT ON ADDICTION TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT. WHAT DID THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
164 DO? WELL, HE TOLD YOU WE BROUGHT YOU DR. KAPLAN, BUT HERE'S
WHAT'S INTERESTING. THEY DIDN'T BRING YOU ANY DEFINITION.
ALL HE DID WAS SAY, "WELL, I HAVE THIS BOOK." NEVER SHOWED
YOU THE BOOK. NEVER SHOWED YOU THE CRITERIA THAT HE USED.
DIDN'T DO THAT AT ALL. DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING TO CHECK HIS
WORK. NOT AT ALL. JUST SAID, "TRUST ME. I KNOW." WELL,
BELIEVE ME, AS WE SHOWED YOU IN CROSS-EXAMINATION THERE'S
PLENTY OF REASON NOT TO TRUST HIM.
HE'S THE SAME MAN THAT USED TO COME IN HERE TO
OTHER JURIES JUST LIKE YOU AND TELL JURIES, "NO, NICOTINE IS
NOT ADDICTIVE, OR I'M SORRY, IT DOESN'T MEET THE CLASSICAL
TECHNICAL DEFINITION." THE SAME PARTY LINE THE CIGARETTE
COMPANIES WERE SAYING DURING THAT TIME.
NOW HE MOVED TO THAT NEW DEFINITION THAT HE CLAIMS
HE USED TO BE AGAINST IT NOW HE'S FOR IT. PLENTY OF REASONS
NOT TO TRUST HIM. HE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN YOU HIS WORK. YOU
WERE ENTITLED TO THAT. YOU DIDN'T GET IT. DR. BURNS SURE
DID. AND YOU CAN CHECK IT AGAINST EVERYTHING YOU HEARD IN
THIS CASE, ALL THE EVIDENCE.
ALL RIGHT. NOW LEGAL CAUSE. UM, COUNSEL FOR THE
CIGARETTE COMPANIES THEY GAVE YOU A NICE STORY ABOUT SOMEBODY
WITH SKIN CANCER AND DOESN'T GO TO THE DOCTOR, DOESN'T GET IT
TREATED, WHAT'S THE CAUSE, WHAT'S THE LEGAL CAUSE? BUT WHAT
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU AND WHAT YOUR JOB WILL BE IN THIS CASE IS
NOT TO DECIDE WHETHER IT'S ONLY ONE LEGAL CAUSE AND NOT -- IF
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
165 IT'S ONE LEGAL CAUSE, IT MEANS THE OTHER ONE WASN'T. SO IF
HE DOESN'T GET IT FIXED, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE SUN DIDN'T
CAUSE IT TOO. THEY BOTH CAN BE LEGAL CAUSES. ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S WHAT THE JUDGE WILL INSTRUCT YOU, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU
CAN ABSOLUTELY FIND. AND EVEN IF YOU FIND THAT HIS FAILURE
TO QUIT, OR HIS INABILITY TO QUIT WAS A LEGAL CAUSE, IT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HIS ADDICTION WASN'T ALSO A LEGAL CAUSE.
AND AS WE SHOWED YOU THROUGHOUT THIS TRIAL, THOSE TWO THINGS
WORK HAND-IN-HAND.
WHAT DOES ADDICTION DO? IT MAKES YOU KEEP SMOKING.
IT MAKES IT HARDER TO PUT IT DOWN. THAT'S WHAT ADDICTION IS.
THAT'S WHAT OUR DOCTOR SHOWED YOU. THAT'S WHAT WE TOLD YOU.
THAT'S WHAT THE COMPANIES KNEW, BY THE WAY. THAT'S WHAT THE
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN STUDYING FOR 50 YEARS. THEY KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT THESE PRODUCTS DO. THEY DESIGNED THEM TO BE THAT WAY.
SO IT'S AMAZING TO IMAGINE THAT SOMEHOW ADDICTION TO A
PRODUCT CAN'T BE A LEGAL CAUSE IF YOUR FAILURE TO QUIT IT
WAS. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THE WAY TO LOOK AT IT
IT'S LIKE, A BICYCLE BUILT FOR TWO. THEY BOTH GO TOGETHER.
THEY BOTH PUSH THE BALL -- PUSH THE BIKE FORWARD. THEY WORK
TOGETHER. SO LONG AS ADDICTION WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT
HE KEPT SMOKING, GOT SICK, YOU'VE GOT TO FIND IN OUR FAVOR.
ALL RIGHT. COUNSEL ALSO CAME UP HERE AND SAID,
"OH, WE DID SOME DUMB THINGS. WE WERE WRONG-HEADED." BUT
WHERE WAS ANY WITNESS FROM THESE COMPANIES TO COME IN AND
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
166 LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND TELL YOU THAT? NONE.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE COMPANY EXECUTIVES SAID, RIGHT?
THEY SAID, WE'VE BEEN A RESPONSIBLE COMPANY. WE NEVER MEANT
TO DECEIVE. WE'RE A MORALISTIC COMPANY. THAT'S WHAT I
HEARD. I DIDN'T HEAR ANYONE SAY, "OH, WE WERE DUMP. OH, WE
WERE WRONG-HEADED. WE DIDN'T MEAN IT." NO ONE CAME IN HERE
TO SAY THAT.
AND THEN, IN FACT, I'M ACTUALLY QUITE SHOCKED THAT
COUNSEL FOR THE CIGARETTE COMPANY SAID WAY BACK WHEN, BACK
WHEN THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT CAME OUT, GOSH, WE WERE
WRONG. WE'RE SORRY. WHAT WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE DONE, WE
SHOULD HAVE JUST KEPT QUIET. I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE SAID WE
SHOULD HAVE JUST KEPT QUIET.
WELL, ACTUALLY I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE REALLY DONE
MORE THAN THAT. THEY CAME OUT ON TV OVER AND OVER WITH THEIR
PAID SPOKESPERSONS AND SAID IF WE FIND ANYTHING IN OUR
PRODUCTS WE'LL TAKE THEM OUT. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO
RESEARCH THIS QUESTION AND WE WORK AND COOPERATE WITH THOSE
WHOSE JOB IT IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH. THEY SHOULDN'T
HAVE JUST KEPT QUIET WITH WHAT THEY KNEW. WHAT THEY HAD BEEN
STUDYING. THEY SHOULD COME OUT AND TELL THE TRUTH. THAT'S
WHAT THEIR EXECUTIVES SAY. THEIR EXECUTIVES SAY WE SHOULD
TELL THE TRUTH. SO I SAW NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER, ANY
EXECUTIVE FROM THESE COMPANIES COME INTO THIS COURTROOM AND
TELL YOU THAT ANYTHING THEY DID WAS WRONG. THAT THEY ADMIT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
167 IT. THEY GET IT. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND, IN FACT, WE EXPECT
FAR MORE EVEN THAN WHAT THAT LAWYER SAID.
ALL RIGHT. A COUPLE OTHER THINGS. TALKED ABOUT
HOW ALL THESE THINGS THAT THEY DID OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS,
HOW THAT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE TO MR. HARRIS.
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL. WELL, WHY WOULD
YOU DO IT THEN? WHY WOULD YOU SPEND BILLIONS, AND BILLIONS,
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WORK WITH YOUR COMPETITORS TO PUT
OUT ADS, TO DENY IT, WHY WOULD YOU DO IT IF IT WOULDN'T MAKE
A DIFFERENCE?
THEY SPENT MORE IN ONE DAY THAN ALL THE PUBLIC
HEALTH AUTHORITIES SPENT IN ONE YEAR TRYING TO HELP WARN
PEOPLE TO QUIT. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT IF IT JUST WOULDN'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL? YOU DON'T SPONSOR AN AD ON THE
SUPERBOWL BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
COME ON. THAT'S JUST NOT CREDIBLE.
AND THEN, WE ALSO HEARD SOME ABOUT THESE INTERNAL
COMPANY DOCUMENTS, AND ALLEGATIONS THAT I SHOWED YOU JUST A
FEW SNIPPETS HERE AND THERE, THAT DIDN'T TELL YOU THE WHOLE
STORY. INTERESTINGLY ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS APPARENTLY TO SHOW
YOU THAT POINT THEY PUT UP A LIST OF THE POSSIBLE
CARCINOGENS. REMEMBER THAT, MR. COFER PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND SAID, "LOOK, WE SENT THESE POSSIBLE CARCINOGENS TO THE
SURGEON GENERAL. THAT MEANS, MS. LONDON SHE WAS TRYING TO
FOOL YOU." BUT WHAT HE DIDN'T REMIND YOU ABOUT WAS THAT THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
168 CIGARETTE COMPANIES ALSO TOLD THE SURGEON GENERAL THOSE ARE
INSUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO CAUSE CANCER, WHICH IS OF COURSE NOT
WHAT THEY KNEW.
AND WE SAW THIS AGAIN WHEN THE MAN UP ON THE VIDEO
HE SAID AGAIN, HE WAS BEING INTERVIEWED BY A TELEVISION
REPORTER, AND HE SAID, "WELL, YEAH, THERE IS POLY (INAUDIBLE)
HYDROCARBONS IN OUR PRODUCTS, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE CANCER.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS TRYING TO SHOW YOU, BUT
CERTAINLY IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT YOU NEEDED
TO SEE TO DISPROVE ALL THAT WE SHOWED YOU ABOUT WHAT THESE
COMPANIES KNEW, AND WHEN THEY KNEW IT, AND WHAT THEY DID AND
WHY, THEY SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THAT TO YOU. THEY SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT SOMEBODY IN HERE TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU AND THEY
ABSOLUTELY DID NOT.
BY THE WAY, OF COURSE MR. HARRIS COULDN'T HAVE
RELIED ON WHAT THESE COMPANIES SAID INSIDE THEIR FILES. THEY
DIDN'T COME OUT, THEY WEREN'T MADE PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE UNTIL
IT WAS AFTER -- FAR TOO LATE FOR HIM.
YOU ALSO HEARD A LOT ABOUT CONVERSATIONS THAT
DIDN'T HAPPEN, THINGS MR. HARRIS NEVER SAID. HE DIDN'T SAY
ABOUT -- THIS ABOUT AN AD, OR HE DIDN'T SAY THIS ABOUT THE
TOBACCO INSTITUTE, BUT EVEN THE CIGARETTE COMPANY EXECUTIVE,
WE BROUGHT HER HERE ON VIDEO, SHE SAID, "WELL, OF COURSE YOU
DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO TALK TO THEIR SPOUSES ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY ADVERTISING WORKS. THAT'S NOT THE WAY
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
169 THAT THIS STRATEGY WORKED." THE COMPANIES KNEW THAT. IT WAS
WALLPAPER. IT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO MISS
IT. THAT'S WHAT THE FTC -- WHEN THEY STUDIED THIS, THAT'S
WHAT THEY FOUND. VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE.
AND, IN FACT -- WELL, THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO BE INSTRUCTED ON AND THAT IS THAT YOU CAN --
YOU CAN PUT TWO-AND-TWO TOGETHER. SO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM
COUNSEL FROM LORILLARD IS, "WELL, GEE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHY
MR. HARRIS WOULD HAVE PICKED KENT III CIGARETTES. NO IDEA
WHATSOEVER. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE ABOUT IT." WELL, THAT'S NOT
TRUE.
NOW, FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW -- WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
MR. HARRIS TO TELL US HERE EXACTLY WHY HE SMOKED KENT III.
THAT'S TRUE, WE DON'T. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT INSTRUCTION
NO. 5. CAN YOU PUT THAT UP, PLEASE?
ALL RIGHT. AND THIS IS CALLED A CHAIN OF EVIDENCE.
YOU CAN PUT TOGETHER A CHAIN OF EVIDENCE AND DRAW ON
CONCLUSIONS. IT SAYS -- CAN YOU HIGHLIGHT THAT. "YOU ARE
NOT LIMITED TO THE BALD STATEMENTS OF THE WITNESSES. YOU ARE
PERMITTED TO DRAW FROM THE FACTS THAT YOU ARE FOUND TO BE
PROVED AND SUCH REASONABLE INFERENCES AS SEEN JUSTIFIED IN
THE LIGHT OF YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE. THAT IS TO SAY, FROM THE
FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVED YOU MAY DRAW AN INFERENCE BASED
UPON REASON AND COMMON SENSE."
OKAY. SO WE KNOW MR. HARRIS SMOKED KENT III
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
170 CIGARETTES. WE KNOW FROM THE DOCUMENTS WHY THE CIGARETTE
COMPANIES MARKETED THEM BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CATCH PEOPLE
AND INTERCEPT THEM FROM QUITTING TO SWITCH TO THESE
SUPPOSEDLY SAFER CIGARETTES, AND THAT'S HOW THEY MARKETED
THEM, EXACTLY HOW THEY MARKETED THEM. YOU SAW THE AD. ALL
THESE FANCY LOW TAR THIS, US GOVERNMENT THIS, AND TESTED BY
THIS AND LOW TAR TECHNOLOGY. ALL OF THESE LIES, RIGHT.
NOW, THEY SAID THE FTC APPROVED THAT AD. WELL, HOW
COULD THE FTC HAVE KNOWN WHAT THEY WERE CONCEALING? THEY
DIDN'T.
SO THEY PUT OUT THIS AD WITH THE MESSAGE. WE KNOW
MR. HARRIS SMOKED THEM. WE KNOW HE WAS TRYING TO QUIT. WE
KNOW HE PUT ON THE PATCH. YOU CAN MAKE ONE -- YOU TAKE EACH
OF THESE FACTS, PUT THEM TOGETHER AND CONCLUDE THAT
MR. HARRIS RELIED TO HIS DETRIMENT THAT HE BELIEVED WHAT HE
SAW AND THAT'S WHY HE SMOKED THESE CIGARETTES. THAT MADE A
DIFFERENCE.
OF COURSE THE JUDGE WILL INSTRUCT YOU THAT THE LAW
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIRECT EVIDENCE, MEANING
TESTIMONY OR DOCUMENTS, AND THIS CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, THE
EVIDENCE THAT YOU PUT TWO-AND-TWO TOGETHER. THEY ARE THE
SAME UNDER THE LAW.
I'M ABOUT TO WRAP UP. NOW, COUNSEL FOR REYNOLDS
TALKED ABOUT MR. HARRIS' CHOICES. TALKED ABOUT RESPECTING
THE CHOICES AND THE DECISIONS THAT HE MADE. WELL, HOW DOES A
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
171 COMPANY SHOW RESPECT FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS' CHOICES? DO THEY
HIDE THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DANGERS THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT? DO
THEY RIG THE PRODUCTS TO MAKE IT AS HARD AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM
TO QUIT? DO THEY TRY -- SHE TALKS ABOUT ALL THESE EXITS ON
THE HIGHWAY. WELL, WE KNOW THEY TRIED TO CLOSE ALL THE EXIT
GATES, KEEP THEIR CUSTOMERS SMOKING AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. YOU
TREAT THEM LIKE PAVLOV'S DOG, YOU TREAT THEM LIKE REPLACEMENT
SMOKERS, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM, FRESH IN YOUR
MIND, YOU KILL EVERY YEAR. THAT'S NO KIND OF RESPECT FOR
YOUR CUSTOMER. NO KIND OF RESPECT FOR THEIR FREE WILL OR
THEIR CHOICES. CERTAINLY NOT WHEN YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING
YOU CAN TO INHIBIT IT.
AND DO THEY KNOW ALL THIS? OH, YES THEY DO. YOU
SAW THIS EXHIBIT DURING THE TRIAL. IT'S EXHIBIT 94. GO BACK
THERE AND LOOK AT IT. WHAT DID THEY WRITE BEFORE THEY CAME
IN TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT BACK WHEN THEY THOUGHT NO ONE WAS
LOOKING? "OH, WE CAN'T DEFEND FREE CHOICE IF THE PERSON WAS
ADDICTED."
SO FINALLY, WHAT IS THIS CASE ALL ABOUT? WELL, THE
LAWYERS FOR THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES SAID THIS IS ALL JUST A
BUNCH OF COINCIDENCES. A BUNCH OF RANDOM ACTS THAT HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. NOTHING THEY DID HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH MR. HARRIS, SPENT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS ON ADS, OH
HE MISSED IT. THE AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN OF DOUBT AND DENIAL,
THE ONE THEY SAID WAS BRILLIANTLY CONCEIVED AND EXECUTED,
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
172 THAT KEPT THEM FROM BEING IN A DEPLORABLE POSITION, THE ONE
THAT MADE THEIR SALES GO UP, AND UP AND, DIDN'T HAVE AN
AFFECT ON HIM. HE JUST MISSED IT. THE REASSURANCE WITH THE
FILTERS, THE ULTRA LIGHTS, LOW TARS, DIDN'T WORK ON HIM. ALL
THAT WORK.
LIKE I SAID FROM THE BEGINNING, TWO STORIES ONE
FROM BEFORE WHEN THEY DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY WAS LOOKING AND
NOW WHEN THEY ARE BEING HELD TO ACCOUNT.
SO MR. COFER SAID THIS CASE HAD THREE QUESTIONS.
NOW, TO BE CLEAR, YOUR VERDICT FORM HAS VERY DIFFERENT
QUESTIONS, AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT YOU WILL BE ANSWERING
IN THIS CASE. AND WE SHOWED YOU BEYOND JUST MORE LIKELY
RIGHT THAN WRONG, BEYOND THAT, THAT WE MET OUR BURDEN ON
THESE CASES -- ON THESE CLAIMS.
THE COURT: WE ARE RIGHT AT TWENTY MINUTES,
COUNSEL. YOU CAN FINISH UP. GO AHEAD.
MS. LONDON: OKAY. THANK YOU.
SO IF I MAY SUGGEST TO YOU, WHY DID MR. HARRIS
SMOKE BASED ON THE EVIDENCE? HE WAS ADDICTED. WHY DID HE
WAIT SO LONG TO QUIT? HE WAS ADDICTED. OH, AND THE CAMPAIGN
OF DOUBT AND DENIAL. AND DID THEY DO SOMETHING THAT CAUSED
HIM TO SMOKE AND GET SICK? YES. WHAT WAS THAT? DIDN'T TELL
THE TRUTH, MADE THEIR CIGARETTES AS ADDICTIVE AS POSSIBLE,
TARGETED YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THEIR ADVERTISING FROM THE 20'S
ALL THE WAY TO TODAY, CONSPIRED FOR 50 YEARS TO CREATE DOUBT,
CONTROVERSY THAT MR. HARRIS EVEN TOLD HIS NEIGHBOR HE WAS
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
173 CONFLICTED. HE BELIEVED THAT.
THAT'S WHAT THIS CASE -- WE HAVE SHOWN YOU, WE HAVE
BROUGHT YOU THE EVIDENCE, AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE VERY
LAST THING I'LL SAY. YOU CAN TAKE THAT DOWN. THANK YOU. I
APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE. THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES CAME UP
HERE AND THEY SAID, "WELL, ALL THIS MONEY IF YOU GIVE A
PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD IT GOES TO MRS. HARRIS." I THINK THAT
WAS TO TRY TO DISCOURAGE YOU, TRY TO PLAY ON YOUR PASSION OR
PREJUDICE ABOUT THAT. SO LET ME BE VERY CLEAR WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT. IF YOU DON'T AWARD PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN THIS CASE
NO ONE WILL. THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITIES, THE CHARITIES
THAT WORK ON THESE CASES, THEY CAN'T DO IT ALONE. THEY CAN'T
STOP THIS EPIDEMIC ALONE. THE PUBLIC RELIES ON YOU, RELIES
ON YOU TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO PUNISH THEM IN THE ONLY
WAY THAT THE LAW KNOWS HOW. PUNISH AND DETER. WE ASK THAT
YOU DO THAT. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
