16                MR. REILLY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
17                Well, good morning, everybody.
18                You know, I think it's appropriate for me
19          to begin my closing argument somewhat like
20          Mr. Johnstone did, by saying, as I said to you
21          in voir dire -- and I am the one who said it to
22          you -- that you take on a tremendous
23          responsibility, along with the very power that
24          we give you when you get chosen as jurors in
25          cases.

 1                And what I want to spend just one minute
 2          talking about is our hopes as litigants and
 3          judiciary in civil cases like this.
 4                In order for this system to work at its
 5          best, what we hope for is that we will luckily
 6          select jurors that pay very close attention to
 7          the evidence.
 8                And, frankly, while I try very, very hard
 9          not to look at you during any part of the
10          trial, because I think that's your space, and
11          whatever you're doing is your -- was what
12          you're doing, sometimes when I was standing at
13          the podium, either examining somebody or
14          cross-examining somebody, I would glance in
15          your direction, I would see you taking lots of
16          notes; and you asked lots of questions, and you
17          obviously paid great attention in this trial,
18          and that's what makes this system work.
19                So, on behalf of Lucy and me, Philip
20          Morris, all the lawyers, all the parties, the
21          Judge, everybody, you're making the system
22          work; but you got your toughest work ahead of
23          you, right?  This is the hard part of your job.
24          Not that sometimes I'm sure the evidence wasn't
25          a little -- a little tedious and a little

 1          complicated and --
 2                But, anyway, now we come to the hard part
 3          of the job, okay?
 4                Now, in my opening statement, I said that
 5          I look forward to the moment in time -- I
 6          reviewed --
 7                I walked you through what I thought was
 8          going to be the evidence in the case, right?
 9          And I said I look forward to the moment at the
10          end of the trial when, in closing argument, we
11          get to walk together -- and I'm not going to
12          walk through a week of evidence, but we get to
13          walk together again through the evidence that
14          occurred in this trial, and see if it didn't
15          turn out to be pretty much what I told you it
16          was going to be.
17                And, in fact, with one area of exception,
18          the evidence turned out to be, frankly, just
19          exactly what I told you it was going to be.
20          Just exactly.  And we'll go over that, and
21          we'll go over the one exception.
22                And I told you that at the end of the
23          case, you were going to get written
24          instructions read to you by Judge Streitfeld,
25          and then given to you by Judge Streitfeld, and

 1          you are.  There are going to be multiple pages
 2          of dense legal language.
 3                But in my opening statement, I said, I
 4          think that you can boil all that down to these
 5          three words.  And I also said, you know what?
 6          I'm a guy that uses boards, and you know that I
 7          said you can -- well, I said you're going --
 8          you're going to see many of the same boards
 9          that I used in my opening statement once again,
10          because that's exactly how the evidence turned
11          out.  I don't have to change a thing.
12                But I said all this -- all this legal
13          language can be condensed down into these three
14          words:  "Control," "causation" and
15          "responsibility."  And I said, what's control?
16                Control is who was in control of
17          Mr. Hatziyannakis' decisions regarding smoking.
18          The decision to begin smoking, the decision to
19          smoke multiple cigarettes, the decision to
20          become a regular smoker, the decision to smoke
21          in the various countries in which he smoked,
22          the decision, if he ever decided he wanted to
23          quit smoking, to make an effort to quit
24          smoking, to quit smoking, who made all those
25          decisions?

 1                The brand choice decisions, who made
 2          brand choice decisions?  Who made brand choice
 3          decisions in every country in which he lived?
 4          Who made all those decisions?  That's who was
 5          in control of all those decisions.
 6                Causation:  It's, basically, two
 7          questions.  Two questions in this case were,
 8          and are, was he addicted, and was addiction the
 9          cause.  And you're going to see this term,
10          "legal cause," was it the legal cause of
11          Mr. Hatziyannakis developing his lung cancer
12          and dying.
13                And you also have the second question of
14          whether or not Philip Morris played some role,
15          some substantial role, some legal cause role,
16          in Mr. Hatziyannakis developing his lung cancer
17          and dying.  That's causation.  Bless you.
18                And then I said, once you know the
19          answers to these two questions, as we walk
20          through the evidence, then you're going to be
21          able to assign responsibility in this case.
22                And you heard Mr. Johnstone say in his
23          closing argument, well, we accept
24          responsibility on the part of
25          Mr. Hatziyannakis.  He said, we accept

 1          responsibility for all the smoking history he
 2          did outside the United States.
 3                You know, there are manufacturers of the
 4          cigarettes, who made the cigarettes that he
 5          smoked outside the United States, but they
 6          accept all the responsibility for all the
 7          smoking he did regardless of whether he was in
 8          Venezuela, Greece, or Canada.
 9                In his closing argument, as he spoke to
10          you just, what -- this was about ten minutes,
11          20 minutes into his argument, he said, we
12          accept the responsibility of all his smoking in
13          all these foreign countries.
14                But in this case, they want to change
15          that situation when Mr. Hatziyannakis steps off
16          the plane in New York, and now they want to
17          hold Philip Morris responsible for the
18          decisions that Mr. Hatziyannakis made while he
19          was here in the United States.  That's what
20          this lawsuit is all about.  All right?
21                They say, Mr. Hatziyannakis is
22          responsible for his smoking behavior outside
23          the United States.  What does it mean when they
24          say that they're accepting responsibility on
25          Mr. Hatziyannakis' part?

 1                I put this board up in my opening
 2          statement.  I said what it means is that
 3          they're acknowledging that Mr. Hatziyannakis'
 4          decisions were a direct substantial cause of
 5          him getting his lung cancer, only they want
 6          that to stop at the border of the United
 7          States.
 8                They accept that Mr. Hatziyannakis could
 9          have quit smoking in time to avoid his lung
10          cancer, but they want that to stop at the
11          border of the United States.
12                I said, you won't see these two -- these
13          three words on the verdict form, and you won't.
14          You won't.  Instead, what you're going to see
15          on the verdict form -- and Mr. Johnstone showed
16          it to you -- are multiple pages of questions.
17                And I'm going to put up the first two
18          questions -- first page.  This is the first
19          page of the verdict form.
20                And I just want to walk through the first
21          two questions on the verdict form, especially
22          the first question, because, you know,
23          Mr. Johnstone said, well, you can go back in
24          the jury room and you can immediately go to the
25          page that tries to apportion responsibility;

 1          but you can't.
 2                The Court's instructions tell you what to
 3          do.  And that's your responsibility as jurors.
 4          Judge Streitfeld's going to read you this
 5          verdict form, and it's going to tell you how
 6          you walk through the verdict form, what your
 7          responsibility as jurors is, what you're
 8          supposed to do.
 9                And what you're supposed to do is answer
10          this question first:  Was Mr. Hatziyannakis --
11          was Christos Hatziyannakis addicted to
12          cigarettes containing nicotine; and, if so, was
13          such addiction a legal cause of his death?
14                That's actually two questions, isn't it?
15          The first question is --
16                Let's just break it up right there.  The
17          first question is, was he addicted.  Was he
18          addicted.  And if he was, then you have to
19          answer the second question of whether or not
20          addiction was a legal cause of his death, a
21          legal cause of his death.
22                As we go through the evidence, I'm going
23          to -- we'll talk more about whether or not he
24          was addicted.  Obviously that was a point of
25          significant discussion in this courtroom.

 1                Evidence was presented on the issue of
 2          addiction from two very distinct points of
 3          view.  One came from a respected member of the
 4          public health community, Dr. David Burns, who
 5          the plaintiffs brought you; and the other came
 6          from, frankly, in spite of what Mr. Johnstone
 7          said, a very respected member of the medical
 8          community, a Board-certified psychiatrist,
 9          psychiatrist with a subspecialty in addiction
10          psychiatry, a very respected member.
11                He's a former medical school professor,
12          he currently remains a medical school professor
13          on a voluntary basis, yet Mr. Johnstone
14          characterized him as somebody that --
15                I don't know.  It was odd.  Odd.
16                They came to this issue in a very
17          different way.  Dr. Burns came from a public
18          health standpoint; Dr. Dosovitz came from the
19          perspective of a guy, as he described it, a guy
20          in the trenches, a guy who sees people coming
21          to them every day who have -- who use
22          substances.
23                He said, I don't treat heroin patients
24          anymore, they're just too tough.  He said, the
25          methamphetamine patients, there are --

 1          virtually a hundred percent of them are
 2          addicted.  It must be a terrible drug.  He
 3          treats cocaine, he treats nicotine.
 4                What did he say about his patients who
 5          come to him, the number of patients who come to
 6          him to deal with stopping smoking?  He said,
 7          look, they represent -- half of my patients are
 8          addiction patients, substance abuse patients of
 9          one form or another.  I have to evaluate them,
10          I have to decide whether they are or aren't,
11          and then I have to create a treatment plan for
12          them.
13                Matter of fact, I thought it was very
14          interesting, Dr. Burns was reporting on when he
15          treated patients who had any kind of substance
16          abuse issues, he said, well, it was when I was
17          in the critical care unit; and I said, well,
18          what would you do?
19                He said, oh, well, when we were in the
20          critical care unit, if we had somebody that we
21          thought had a substance abuse problem, we would
22          call for a psych consult.
23                And what was that?  I asked Dr. Dosovitz,
24          what's a psych consult?  He said that's where
25          they call for me, people with my expertise, and

 1          we come in and we tell the pulmonologists, the
 2          internists of the world, is this person really
 3          addicted, is this -- how do you deal with this
 4          person?
 5                And that's the guy that I brought you.
 6          And he gave you, from his perspective, after
 7          30-something years of doing this, what he
 8          thinks about.  And, granted, neither he nor
 9          Dr. Burns ever got an opportunity to examine
10          Mr. Hatziyannakis; he died many, many, many
11          years ago.
12                Mr. Johnstone said that Dr. Dosovitz
13          never even asked to interview the family.
14          Nobody says interview the family.  If you can
15          interview the patient, you interview the
16          patient.  There's no opportunity in this case
17          to interview the patient.
18                There's no law in the State of Florida
19          that allows us to require or ask for an
20          interview of the family.  I don't know why he
21          said it.  There's no opportunity to do that.
22                MR. JOHNSTONE:  I object.  That's a
23          misstatement of the law.  I object.
24                THE COURT:  Restate it.  Continue.
25                MR. REILLY:  The bottom line here is, you

 1          have to answer this question:  Was he addicted;
 2          and if so, was that addiction a legal cause of
 3          his lung cancer and death.
 4                And, by the way, if the answer to this
 5          question is "no," that ends your work in this
 6          case, you'll go home.
 7                Now, Mr. Johnstone went all the way
 8          through the verdict form.  I'm sure I'll go all
 9          the way through the verdict form, as well; but
10          I just want to point out to you right away,
11          that is a decisive question right there.  If
12          the answer to that question is "no," you do no
13          more work in this case and you go home.
14                All right.  What does legal cause
15          require?  This is the same board I used in my
16          opening statement.  I said, look, this is a
17          shorthand way of thinking about legal cause.
18          In order for something to be a legal cause --
19                And you're going to see the complex
20          language in the instructions the Court gives
21          you.
22                Law students go to law school for three
23          years to try to figure that out, and lawyers
24          like me try to explain it for the rest of our
25          lives to jurors.  It is dense.

 1                The shorthand of it is, in order for
 2          something to be a legal cause, there has to be
 3          a direct connection between whatever it is and
 4          whatever the outcome is.
 5                For example, for Philip Morris to have
 6          been a legal cause of injury to
 7          Mr. Hatziyannakis, there has to have been a
 8          direct connection between Philip Morris so that
 9          there was a substantial impact on
10          Mr. Hatziyannakis, and then Philip Morris can
11          be a legal cause.
12                Let me give you just an example.
13          Mr. Johnstone put up a number of documents, a
14          number of old Philip Morris documents.  Do you
15          know how many of those were even created during
16          the time that Mr. Hatziyannakis was here in the
17          United States?  I think there might have been
18          one.  How many of those --
19                I'll get to it later.
20                The bottom line is, for Philip Morris to
21          be a legal cause of injury to
22          Mr. Hatziyannakis, there has to be a direct
23          connection between something that Philip Morris
24          did that had a substantial impact on him that
25          resulted in an outcome, the legal cause.  And

 1          that's true for the addiction as well.  And
 2          we'll go through that in detail.
 3                But I said, you know, in order to know
 4          the answer to this question, was he addicted
 5          and whether or not the addiction was the legal
 6          cause of his injury, you've got to know his
 7          smoking history, right?  You have to know his
 8          smoking history.
 9                The next question asks, basically, the
10          same thing, but it asks it specifically about
11          cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris,
12          period.  Did he become addicted to cigarettes
13          manufactured by Philip Morris, and was that
14          addiction a legal cause of his injury.
15                Now, you heard Mr. Johnstone tell you
16          that Mr. Hatziyannakis became addicted to
17          cigarettes outside the United States, before he
18          ever got here, before he ever got here.
19                Did he tell you that that addiction
20          caused Mr. Hatziyannakis to develop his lung
21          cancer and die?  No, you didn't hear that.
22                Did he tell you that when he set foot on
23          American soil, that all of a sudden the
24          addiction that he said began outside the United
25          States went away?  No, he didn't say that.

 1                Did he tell you that when he went back to
 2          Greece, that the addiction wasn't there, or
 3          that when he came back to the United States,
 4          the addiction wasn't there, that it started
 5          here.  And where, we'll talk about that in just
 6          a minute.  No, he didn't.
 7                So, now let's just take a little bit of
 8          our time -- because Mr. Johnstone didn't do
 9          this -- let's just walk through
10          Mr. Hatziyannakis' smoking history.
11                And, you know, when this case started,
12          during the discovery phase, when the
13          depositions were being taken, and even straight
14          on through the direct examination, when
15          Mrs. Hatziyannakis was on the witness stand,
16          what she told everybody was, my husband wasn't
17          smoking when I met him in 1965, and he didn't
18          begin smoking until 1967 in Canada.
19                On cross-examination, she said to Lucy
20          Mason, well, my husband was sneaking some
21          cigarettes in '66 in Venezuela.
22                Harry Hatziyannakis and Clio
23          Hatziyannakis both came here, and they both
24          reported that Mr. Hatziyannakis told them --
25          told them directly that he began smoking as a

 1          young man.  Their impression was it was in
 2          Greece.  At this point, that's the most likely
 3          beginning point for Mr. Hatziyannakis beginning
 4          his smoking.
 5                You have these pictures of him.  Now,
 6          Mrs. Hatziyannakis has had these pictures since
 7          she moved to Toronto in 1967.  So, she said,
 8          well, these pictures are in Venezuela and these
 9          are Mr. Hatziyannakis.  Does he look like he's
10          sneaking those cigarettes?  No.
11                Here's Mr. Hatziyannakis in Venezuela in
12          December of 1966, he's smoking cigarettes with
13          a cigarette holder.
14                I'm sorry, I'm probably in your way.
15                Here he is with Mrs. Hatziyannakis at
16          Christmastime in December of '66.  Here he is
17          at Christmastime, again, or sometime in
18          December of '66, with Mrs. Hatziyannakis, and
19          here he is smoking a cigar, there's the smoke
20          from the cigar, in January of 1967, a month
21          later.
22                Now, that's clearly not sneaking
23          cigarettes.  Mr. Hatziyannakis was clearly
24          smoking.  Here he is, what is he in his early
25          20's?  I don't know exactly how old he is.  Is

 1          he in Venezuela?  Did he start smoking in
 2          Greece?
 3                He told his family, I started smoking as
 4          a young man.  So we still don't know whether
 5          the beginning is in Greece or Venezuela, but
 6          here he is in his 20's.  That's in the 50's.
 7          That's in the 50's.
 8                And whoever made these cigarettes,
 9          whatever company, we don't know what company
10          made the cigarettes or the cigar that he was
11          smoking in Venezuela or Greece, but
12          Mr. Hatziyannakis, based on counsel's
13          statement, he's taking full responsibility for
14          those cigarettes that he smoked, full
15          responsibility.  These are the cigarettes --
16                And that's the question that I was asking
17          Dr. Burns.  He said that I said it didn't
18          matter where he began.
19                The question I asked Dr. Burns was, is
20          Mr. Hatziyannakis fully responsible for
21          beginning smoking cigarettes?
22                And Dr. Burns and I at that time were
23          talking about the fact that who knew where he
24          actually began; and so, sure, I said, for that
25          purpose, for the purpose of that question, does

 1          it really matter where he started?
 2                And Dr. Burns said, no, it doesn't
 3          matter, because he said, wherever he starts,
 4          he's fully responsible for the decision to
 5          begin smoking.
 6                Of course, that's true.  Whether it's
 7          Venezuela or Greece or Canada, it doesn't
 8          matter, he's fully responsible for the
 9          decision, of course.
10                All right.  And that's exactly what I
11          asked -- sorry -- that's exactly what I asked
12          Dr. Burns.  I said, if, in fact,
13          Mr. Hatziyannakis began smoking -- and this is
14          a misprint by the court reporter, but it's in
15          the transcript -- in 1967, it should have been,
16          in Canada, because that's what
17          Mrs. Hatziyannakis --
18                Remember, he was the first witness to
19          testify in this case, so we didn't have the
20          testimony of Mrs. Hatziyannakis yet, so that's
21          why I said, in 1967, in Canada, the decision to
22          begin smoking there would have been his
23          decision, wouldn't it?
24                And he said the first cigarettes he
25          smoked in Canada would have been his decision,

 1          sure.  Sure.
 2                And then I went through with Dr. Burns,
 3          well, the decision to continue smoking.  In
 4          fact, if it took him a period of time to
 5          become, in your opinion, addicted, the
 6          cigarettes he smoked during that time would
 7          have been solely an unencumbered decision on
 8          his part to continuing smoking at that point in
 9          time; correct?
10                Yes.  He was being urged on by friends,
11          but it was certainly not an addiction-driven
12          choice.  Now, how long did that last?
13                There was another question I asked of
14          Dr. Burns.  Let me make this real simple.
15                For whatever period of time
16          Mr. Hatziyannakis wasn't addicted, the decision
17          to smoke each cigarette he smoked was his
18          decision alone, wasn't it?  And he said, yes.
19                Dr. Burns thinks he was addicted, but he
20          says, look, until he's addicted, he's the only
21          one who makes the decision.
22                I said, how long is that going to take?
23                Do you have an opinion --
24                Oh, this is a question by Mr. Johnstone:
25          Do you have an opinion, more likely than not,

 1          when Chris became addicted to the nicotine that
 2          was contained in the cigarettes he was smoking?
 3                Now, those cigarettes are in either
 4          Greece or Venezuela, right?  He probably became
 5          addicted within the first four or five years of
 6          the time he was smoking.
 7                Now, we still don't know when that four-
 8          or five-year time frame expired, but just to
 9          make sure that the design of the cigarettes was
10          not of any significance in differentiating
11          cigarettes in the United -- the Marlboro
12          cigarettes in the United States, or any of the
13          foreign cigarettes that he smoked, to make sure
14          there was no design difference of any
15          significance in this case, I asked this
16          question of Dr. Burns.
17                I said:  No cigarette has a greater or
18          lesser propensity to develop addiction in
19          smokers, does it?  No cigarette, whether it's
20          in Venezuela, Greece, Canada, or a Marlboro in
21          the United States, no cigarette has a greater
22          or lesser propensity to develop addiction in
23          smokers, does it?
24                And his answer was:  As far as we know
25          currently, we can't distinguish any addiction

 1          potential for different cigarettes.  It is
 2          possible that might exist, but we can't
 3          distinguish it at this point in time, period.
 4                Is there anybody that said anything
 5          different?  One guy, an ex-employee of Philip
 6          Morris that was fired more than 25 years ago.
 7                But here is their public health expert,
 8          the guy who's written all these chapters, the
 9          guy who's done all this work, here he is
10          telling you there is no difference.
11                And Mr. Johnstone just acknowledged, and
12          Dr. Burns has already said, this guy is
13          addicted to the nicotine in his cigarettes in
14          wherever it is.  Is it Greece, is it Venezuela,
15          is it Canada?
16                I went further with Dr. Burns on this
17          point.  I said:  Are all cigarettes equal in
18          terms of their propensity to cause lung cancer?
19                I said:  The cigarettes in Greece caused
20          people who smoked them in Greece to develop
21          cancer of the lung and other diseases?
22                Certainly did.
23                Just as readily as cigarettes in
24          Venezuela?
25                As far as we are able to determine at

 1          this point, yes.
 2                They certainly all had that capability.
 3          They certainly all caused large numbers of lung
 4          cancer deaths in their population.  The same is
 5          true in Canada, and the same is true in the
 6          United States.  Both Canada and the United
 7          States have also had large numbers of people
 8          who died from smoking cigarettes manufactured
 9          in their own country.  No difference, no place,
10          no design difference, period.  And that came
11          from their expert.
12                Did the cigarettes that he smoked in
13          Venezuela, Greece, Canada, play a substantial
14          role in Mr. Hatziyannakis developing his lung
15          cancer?
16                This is their expert, Dr. Burns.  I said:
17          Doctor, if he had quit smoking in 1981, would
18          he more probably than not have developed lung
19          cancer anyway?
20                And he said:  Maybe yes, maybe no, can't
21          tell.
22                The fact is, he didn't quit smoking, and
23          consequently all the smoking he did before
24          1981, ends up contributing to his ultimate
25          development of cancer; correct?

 1                And he said:  All before and all after,
 2          because he didn't quit, yes.  Because he didn't
 3          quit, yes.
 4                That's their expert.  That's their
 5          expert.  Here he is.  If he's smoking in
 6          Greece, when he gets to Venezuela, and he gets
 7          off the plane, this is --
 8                You remember I did this with Dr. Burns?
 9          Unfortunately, we had many steps because -- we
10          had many stops; right?
11                And I said:  Doctor, when he gets off the
12          plane, this time in Venezuela, he's got two
13          decisions to make; I'm going to stop smoking or
14          I'm going to continue to smoke; and if I'm
15          going to continue to smoke, I've got to select
16          a brand, right?  And Dr. Burns said, that's
17          right.
18                1965, Mrs. Hatziyannakis meets
19          Mr. Hatziyannakis.  They meet in Greece, they
20          date.  She says, in trial, he's not smoking.
21          You see the pictures.  You see the pictures.
22                Now, in trial, she said, yes, in 1966, he
23          started to sneak cigarettes, he was sneaking,
24          that's what she said.
25                Lucy Mason was cross-examining her.  You

 1          see the pictures.  Why she characterized it
 2          that way, I have no idea, honestly; but
 3          pictures are worth a thousand words, so I'll
 4          save you a thousand words.
 5                But the bottom line is, obviously, he was
 6          a regular smoker in Venezuela, and now you know
 7          that, unfortunately, because of the earthquake
 8          the family moves to Canada.
 9                And, again, when Mr. Hatziyannakis gets
10          off the plane in Canada, where he's going to
11          start new businesses and have a new life, he's
12          got two smoking decisions to make.
13                And you know from Mrs. Hatziyannakis'
14          testimony that as soon as she saw him smoking
15          in Venezuela, she told him, look, I hate
16          smoking, smoking is bad for your health,
17          smoking is addicting, you're going to -- you're
18          not going to be able to quit, and what did she
19          say he said?
20                She said he said, well, I'm only going to
21          do it for a while because I'm under a lot of
22          stress.  She said, don't do it, I hate it, it's
23          bad for your health, you can die.
24                How did she know?  Because she learned it
25          in Sunday school and she learned it from her

 1          dad.  So, ten years before Mr. Hatziyannakis
 2          ever gets here to the United States, his
 3          fiancee, future wife, now his wife, tells him,
 4          do not smoke.
 5                And you heard my exchange with Dr. Burns.
 6          I said, you know, he has a choice, doesn't he?
 7          He can do what his wife asks him to do, or he
 8          can decide not to, can't he?
 9                And Dr. Burns says:  Yes, he should have
10          listened to her advice, husbands oftentimes
11          should, but he chose not to.
12                Anybody else play a role in that
13          decision?  Is Philip Morris anywhere in this
14          picture?
15                Mr. Johnstone has said they accept full
16          responsibility for the decisions he made when
17          he gets off the plane in Canada and chooses a
18          brand.
19                Now, the manufacturer, whose brand he
20          chose, makes a cigarette called du Maurier.  My
21          French is worse than terrible, far worse than
22          terrible.
23                No one is attempting to hold the
24          manufacturer of du Maurier cigarettes
25          responsible in this case, their cigarettes are

 1          just as addicting, just as capable of causing
 2          cancer, and they played just as much a role in
 3          Mr. Hatziyannakis getting his lung cancer in
 4          this case, but no one is holding them
 5          responsible in this case.  No one is trying to.
 6          Mr. Hatziyannakis --
 7                Or they're accepting full responsibility
 8          for the decisions that Mr. Hatziyannakis made
 9          in smoking every du Maurier cigarette that he
10          smoked, every cigarette he smoked in Canada,
11          every cigarette he smoked in Venezuela.
12                Is there any evidence in this case that
13          there were any warnings on the du Maurier
14          cigarettes?  None.  But Mrs. Hatziyannakis is
15          there, telling him, don't smoke, don't smoke,
16          frequently, you heard it, frequently,
17          vigorously, angrily.
18                Is Mr. Hatziyannakis a guy, before he
19          even gets to the United States, that doesn't
20          know that there's a risk in smoking, that
21          there's a risk in developing illness and dying
22          or becoming addicted?  His wife has told him a
23          thousand times.
24                1971, he smoked in Canada for four years
25          and moved to Greece; right?  He wanted to get

 1          out of the cold climate of Canada, wanted to go
 2          home, go to Greece.  Once again, he gets off
 3          the airplane, he has a couple of decisions to
 4          make about smoking.
 5                My decisions are, am I going to continue
 6          to smoke.  If I'm going to continue to smoke,
 7          what brand am I going to smoke.  And when he
 8          gets off the plane, he makes the same
 9          decisions, right?  I'm going to continue to
10          smoke, I'm not going to do what my wife says,
11          I'm going to continue to smoke.  He chooses a
12          brand.
13                We don't know what brand he chose.  There
14          was a discussion of Karelia cigarettes, a Greek
15          cigarette, but I don't think there was a real
16          identification for sure that that was the brand
17          that he smoked there.
18                But whatever he smoked, for some reason
19          they distinguish between the full
20          responsibility they take for every cigarette he
21          smoked in Greece, but not the Marlboros he
22          smoked in the United States.
23                Did Philip Morris play any role in his
24          decision to smoke Greek cigarettes?  Absolutely
25          none.  You know that.  He's nowhere near the

 1          United States yet.  Nowhere near there.
 2                You know he opens new businesses in
 3          Greece, he stays -- the family stays in Greece
 4          until 1974, when they move to the United
 5          States.  Now, this is the first time they will
 6          have set foot on American soil.  And let's stop
 7          for a moment and ask ourselves, so what is the
 8          situation before he ever smokes his first
 9          Marlboro?
10                Well, the situation is they've already
11          said he's -- they've said he's addicted,
12          addicted to the cigarettes that he smoked
13          outside the United States.  So, if he's
14          addicted, as they say he is, he's addicted.
15          They say --
16                Well, by this time, how many cigarettes
17          has he smoked in Greece?  Mrs. Hatziyannakis
18          said he was smoking two packs a day.  That's 40
19          cigarettes a day.  She said he was smoking a
20          pack and a half in Greece, but you guys figured
21          out that's 25 cigarettes to the pack, a pack
22          and a half is really two packs of 20 cigarettes
23          a day.  Or a cigarette off.
24                So, Mr. Johnstone says, well, that's --
25          he does a calculation.  You can do the same

 1          calculation.  Going back how many years now?
 2          Are we back to the mid- to late 50's, has he
 3          been smoking for 15 or 20 years?  How old is he
 4          before he sets foot --
 5                The moment he steps foot in the United
 6          States, how old is he, and makes the decision
 7          to smoke his first Marlboro?  He's 38 years
 8          old.  After having smoked for 15 or 20 years,
 9          here's a Marlboro ad.  They want you to
10          conclude that somehow this Marlboro ad, with a
11          warning right on it, caused Mr. Hatziyannakis,
12          at age 38, to do what?
13                He's already been smoking at the rate of
14          two packs a day in Greece, he's gone to the
15          store to buy more cigarettes in the United
16          States.  What did -- what impact --
17                I mean, you guys didn't leave your common
18          sense at the front door.  What impact did that
19          have on a guy that they say was addicted and
20          has now been smoking cigarettes at the rate of
21          two packs a day for how long?  Fifteen years,
22          20 years.  That's a puzzle.
23                What about all the advertising that
24          occurred in Greece and Venezuela?  They're not
25          claiming any responsibility on the part of the

 1          manufacturers who advertised their cigarettes
 2          in Greece or Venezuela or Canada.  What about
 3          the du Maurier ads?
 4                Oh, and by the way, just so we're
 5          perfectly clear about this, Mrs. Hatziyannakis
 6          said he smoked some cigarettes called Marlboro
 7          in Canada.  There is no relationship between
 8          the cigarettes called Marlboro in Canada and
 9          Philip Morris' USA manufactured Marlboros.
10          There's no dispute about that.  Let's clear
11          that up.  Now --
12                And, by the way, here are the pictures of
13          Mr. Hatziyannakis smoking in Canada.  Here are
14          the du Maurier cigarettes.  Here he is smoking
15          pipes.  He smokes pipes, he smokes du Mauriers.
16          There you go.
17                All right.  Now, what is the situation in
18          terms of a warning when he gets off the
19          airplane in the United States?
20                Let me just take these down.
21                Well, the situation is that there is a
22          warning not only on every pack of cigarettes,
23          there's a warning on every ad in a magazine,
24          there's a warning on every billboard here in
25          the United States.

 1                What is that warning?  It says:  Warning:
 2          The Surgeon General has determined that
 3          cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.
 4                Now, somebody might say, oh, well, that
 5          warning's kind of little, but that warning was
 6          spotted by Mrs. Hatziyannakis, and she read it,
 7          she understood it, she translated it, she said
 8          it to her husband in Greek.
 9                She said, look, look, there it is, a
10          warning on every pack of your Marlboros says
11          this is dangerous for your health.
12                If her message hadn't gotten through to
13          Mr. Hatziyannakis in Venezuela or Greece or
14          Canada, there it is, in black and white, on
15          every ad, on every billboard, on every pack of
16          cigarettes here in the United States, every
17          Marlboro pack of cigarettes he smoked, every
18          Marlboro pack of cigarettes he bought.
19                Now, they say -- they say
20          Mr. Hatziyannakis -- that somehow this ad
21          caused him to do something.  I can't figure out
22          what the something is, though, because he's
23          already, by their description, a committed,
24          addicted smoker, right?  So, that ad,
25          obviously, doesn't make him begin to smoke, and

 1          he's already smoking.
 2                But I asked -- I asked Harry
 3          Hatziyannakis, the eldest son, I said, why did
 4          your dad pick Marlboros?  I said, your father
 5          never told you why he selected any given brand
 6          of cigarettes, did he?  He said we really -- we
 7          never had a conversation about it.
 8                You could stop that answer right there.
 9          We never had a conversation about it.  But he
10          went on to say, but I -- he always liked going
11          with big name brands -- well, there's no
12          question that Marlboro is a big name brand --
13          thinking that, you know, it's always a safer
14          way to go when you buy name-brand stuff.  For
15          quality?  Yes.  There you go.
16                I'm going to run out of space here.  All
17          right.  So, now, what's different about the
18          situation and the responsibility when
19          Mr. Hatziyannakis lands in the United States?
20                Why is it that now all of a sudden, in
21          this courtroom, that's supposed to be a
22          different situation than --
23                Here's all the blue.  You see the colors?
24          This is all the blue smoking that he's -- that
25          they say he's responsible for, before he gets

 1          to the United States.  And then they say, well,
 2          when he steps off the plane --
 3                Every morning in the mirror when
 4          Mr. Hatziyannakis gets up in Greece, Venezuela,
 5          Canada, and he looks in the mirror and he says,
 6          today I'm a smoker, I'm smoking today, I'm
 7          smoking my two packs today, in all those
 8          foreign countries, he's the only person in the
 9          mirror, the only person to be held responsible.
10                But when he steps into the bathroom in
11          the United States, all of a sudden they want
12          you to put Philip Morris in the mirror with
13          him.  Their cigarettes are no more dangerous,
14          no more addicting than all the cigarettes he
15          smoked right here.
16                But for some reason they're now supposed
17          to be in the mirror, too.  Why is that?  Does
18          his responsibility change when he gets to the
19          United States?  Does it change when he's
20          addicted?
21                This is their expert, Dr. Burns.  I asked
22          him:  Even after in your estimation he became
23          addicted, Mr. Hatziyannakis doesn't lose the
24          responsibility for smoking his cigarettes, does
25          he?  This is their expert.  That's his complete

 1          answer:  He does not.  That's his complete
 2          answer.
 3                All right.  The warning stays on every
 4          pack, every ad, et cetera.  Mr. Hatziyannakis
 5          creates new businesses, they move from New York
 6          City, to Arizona and back, and then because of
 7          an illness in her family, and because they want
 8          to have -- be closer to home, and new business
 9          opportunities, they move back to Greece.
10                Now, I can't imagine what it is that
11          differentiates Mr. Hatziyannakis and his
12          responsibility when he gets back to Greece; but
13          Mr. Johnstone said, you know what?  When he
14          does his foreign smoking, he's completely
15          responsible.
16                So, when he gets off the airplane in
17          Athens, all of a sudden because he goes to the
18          store and instead of buying Marlboros, he buys
19          Karelias, or some other Greek brand, he's fully
20          responsible again.  What -- what happened?
21                He's in Greece now for another three
22          years, '78 to '81, smoking two packs a day.  He
23          opens that bicycle carrier business.  You know,
24          this guy is smart, he's entrepreneurial, he's
25          disciplined, he's successful, he's intelligent.

 1                What happened that makes this difference?
 2          It certainly isn't because he ever heard or saw
 3          anything from Philip Morris or any other
 4          American cigarette manufacturer other than ads
 5          with warnings on them.
 6                How do we know that?  Well, first of all,
 7          no family member -- and they all came here --
 8          not one family member came here and said my
 9          father ever heard or saw anything from a
10          cigarette manufacturer ever, other than the ads
11          for Marlboros.  Nothing.
12                So, all these things that Mr. Johnstone
13          puts up -- and remember, look at the dates on
14          them -- but all these things that Mr. Johnstone
15          talks about, nobody ever came here and said
16          that anything that Philip Morris ever said,
17          other than those ads, was ever seen by
18          Mr. Hatziyannakis.
19                And I confirmed that with -- I'm going to
20          leave it there -- I confirmed that with their
21          expert, Dr. Burns, who said, I read all the
22          depositions of all the family members in this
23          case.
24                And I said, Doctor, you saw in the
25          depositions of his family members that they

 1          testified at no time did he tell any of his
 2          family members that he ever saw any statement
 3          by Philip Morris or any other cigarette
 4          manufacturer or the Tobacco Institute or
 5          anybody else connected with the tobacco
 6          industry during the time that he lived in the
 7          United States, right?
 8                Dr. Burns said:  I think that is a bit of
 9          an overstatement.  What is clear is he never
10          saw a statement by the tobacco industry that
11          was significantly important to him that he
12          would have discussed it with his family members
13          in a way that was significantly memorable to
14          those family members that they remembered it
15          and reported it in deposition.
16                That's a long-winded way of saying no.
17          No.
18                All right.  And besides, since at least
19          1965 or 6, Mr. Hatziyannakis has been hearing
20          from his wife regularly, loudly, angrily,
21          you're killing yourself, you're addicting
22          yourself, I don't want you to smoke.  Now he
23          hears it --
24                When he goes back to Greece, he's hearing
25          it from his own parents, he's hearing it from

 1          his in-laws.  During the time that he was
 2          living in the United States, '74 to '78, every
 3          pack told him, every ad told him.
 4                There's no failure to warn claim in this
 5          case.  They're not claiming Philip Morris
 6          failed to warn him about something.
 7                1981, family moves back.  When he steps
 8          off the plane, they want to have a new
 9          situation.  They want to go back to now
10          Mr. Hatziyannakis isn't fully responsible for
11          all the cigarettes that he smokes, now Philip
12          Morris is supposed to be back in the mirror.
13                What's different?  There's still a
14          warning on every pack.  There's still no -- no
15          seeing --
16                And is it any surprise --
17                Mr. Hatziyannakis, you heard, doesn't
18          really read English very well.  Is there any
19          surprise on the part of anybody that no family
20          member came here and said Mr. Hatziyannakis
21          ever said, I heard anything from Philip Morris
22          or any other cigarette manufacturer or anybody
23          else connected with the tobacco industry here
24          in the United States that misled me in any way?
25          In any way.  Never said that.

 1                All right.  1981 to 1988, they say
 2          Mr. Hatziyannakis smokes two to three packs a
 3          day.  Maybe he does.  I don't know.  But what I
 4          do know is that the testimony was, from Harry
 5          Hatziyannakis and Clio Hatziyannakis, that
 6          around 1988, or thereabouts, Mr. Hatziyannakis
 7          says, I quit.  He quit for a period of time,
 8          and then for the next five years, until his
 9          death, nobody sees him smoking.
10                Now, occasionally -- now, occasionally,
11          there are exceptions to that.  When Harry goes
12          off to the Gulf War for a period of time, his
13          dad was then smoking openly.  When
14          Mrs. Hatziyannakis' has gallbladder surgery, he
15          resumes open smoking.
16                But the rest of the time they don't see
17          him smoking, and occasionally they see
18          indications that he's smoking, because they see
19          the packs of cigarettes around, or they see
20          ashes and they confront him with it.
21                Not just one family member, but as a
22          group.  You heard about it.  As a group, they
23          would come to him and say, hey, husband, hey,
24          dad, hey, father-in-law, I see residue, I see
25          indications that you're smoking.

 1                And what was his answer?  He would say,
 2          I'm smoking one or two.  Now, maybe he was
 3          smoking more than that; but what you know is
 4          that if you're not smoking in front of your
 5          wife, if you're smoking in front of your
 6          children, that means when you get up in the
 7          morning, you can't smoke.
 8                That means when you're having breakfast
 9          and coffee, you can't smoke.  It means that
10          when you're driving with your wife to the shop,
11          you can't smoke.
12                The only time you can smoke is when
13          you're driving -- after you dropped her off,
14          you can drive on to the Mobil station, you can
15          smoke at the Mobil station, and you can smoke
16          from the Mobil station back to the shop.
17          That's how long he can smoke, and that's a
18          half-day job for him.  And that's it.  Because
19          the rest of the day you're with your wife, and
20          you can't smoke.
21                That means you can't smoke before dinner,
22          you can't smoke after dinner, you can't smoke
23          in the evening, you can't smoke on the patio
24          when you're listening to music.  You can't
25          smoke.  You can't smoke before you go to bed.

 1                And you remember that Harry, even though
 2          he's a student, even though he's not spending a
 3          lot of time at home, he's still at home until
 4          he gets married in 1992.
 5                And you didn't hear any different
 6          information from Mrs. Hatziyannakis.  In 1993,
 7          when he's diagnosed, does he quit?  It's a
 8          little unclear.  Mrs. Hatziyannakis said he
 9          quit.  Did he quit -- did he quit because he
10          couldn't smoke?  I don't know.
11                You know, I asked Dr. Burns --
12                Oh, and by the way, in 1985, you know
13          that the warnings on the packs changes.  In
14          1985, the warnings on the packs changes, and
15          now it says:  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart
16          disease, emphysema, and can complicate
17          pregnancy.  Smoke contains carbon monoxide.  It
18          says:  Quitting now greatly reduces your -- can
19          greatly reduce your risk of disease.  It's
20          rotating warnings.
21                All right.  All right.  You know, I asked
22          their expert, Dr. Burns.  Can every smoker
23          quit?  This is what I asked Dr. Burns.
24                I believe that nicotine addiction can be
25          overcome, and there is no addiction that can't

 1          be overcome.  That's their expert.
 2                This goes to the question of control and
 3          legal cause.  Will people quit smoking --
 4          excuse me -- if they're not motivated to quit?
 5          If you don't want to quit, are you going to
 6          quit?
 7                I asked Harry, his son:  But, frankly,
 8          you don't even think your dad was motivated to
 9          quit until the late 80's, do you?
10                His answer was:  I don't think so.
11                Back to that original word "control."
12          Who's in control of Mr. Hatziyannakis'
13          decisions regarding his smoking?  Who's in
14          control?  Well --
15                And remember what Harry went on to say
16          was, I believe the only reason why
17          Mr. Hatziyannakis became motivated to quit
18          smoking after that was because he just wanted
19          to avoid all the argument that we were giving
20          him.  He wanted to get us off his back.
21                That was exactly what he said, get us off
22          his back.  You know, you would think, based on
23          Mr. Johnstone's argument, that Dr. Dosovitz and
24          Dr. Burns were completely at odds in this case,
25          wouldn't you; but, in fact, they agree -- let

 1          me see if I can get out of everybody's way --
 2          that the decision to begin smoking was
 3          Mr. Hatziyannakis' alone.
 4                The decision to continue smoking was
 5          Mr. Hatziyannakis' alone.  Mr. Hatziyannakis
 6          continued to smoke for years without being
 7          influenced by addiction.
 8                Obviously, Dr. Dosovitz believes he
 9          continued to smoke his entire smoking career
10          without addiction.  He could have quit anytime,
11          if he was sufficiently motivated, expended
12          enough effort, and had the right circumstances
13          and support to quit.  They both agreed on that.
14                Who was in control?  What's different --
15          what's different about what happens in the
16          United States versus what happens in any one of
17          those other countries?  What's different?
18                Mr. Hatziyannakis is totally responsible
19          in every other country, but he has no
20          responsibility here.  How can that be?  All.
21                Right.  On this issue --
22                Let me put this down.
23                Addiction was described as compulsive
24          smoking, right?  Compelled smoking.  Loss of
25          control.

 1                When Dr. Dosovitz was describing his
 2          determination that he thought that
 3          Mr. Hatziyannakis had not truly been addicted,
 4          he said, look, I looked at several factors,
 5          because I try to get as much in-depth
 6          information as I can.
 7                For Dr. Burns it was, if you smoked a lot
 8          of cigarettes over a long enough period of
 9          time, and I see that you tried to quit and you
10          didn't quit, you're addicted.  Very simple.
11          Works for the public health guy.  That's okay.
12                For Dr. Dosovitz, who has to deal with
13          these people every day, every day, he said, you
14          know what?  And he said, I apply this criteria
15          across the board, whether I'm dealing with
16          somebody that's a heroin -- or he doesn't do
17          heroin anymore -- a cocaine addict or a meth
18          addict, an alcoholic, somebody that wants to
19          quit smoking, I look to see, you know what, do
20          they have a loss of control, really?
21                And he looked at, in particular various
22          instances that he talked to you about,
23          especially the end of '88 through '93, where
24          Mr. Hatziyannakis doesn't smoke in the presence
25          of his family, except on those few occasions,

 1          and he said, you know, that is to me -- to me,
 2          that's real control, that is not compulsive
 3          smoking.
 4                Withdrawal symptoms, he said, you know
 5          what, I need to know whether or not --
 6                The hallmark of addiction is you're going
 7          to have withdrawal symptoms.  What are they?
 8          He said it's not the shakes, that's not what
 9          people get.  You can get that with alcoholism,
10          you can get that with a lot of other
11          addictions, but what you're going to get is
12          irritability, sleeplessness, anger, loss of
13          concentration, that sort of thing.
14                And that was asked of Jim and Harry, and
15          nobody reported it.  They said his personality
16          never changed.  Clio, personality never changed
17          when he was smoking, when he wasn't smoking.
18                Failed self-motivated quitting.  Well,
19          there never was any failed self-motivated
20          quitting because Harry said he wasn't really
21          interested in quitting until '88, until the
22          late 80's, and he said, even then it was to get
23          us off his back.  That's what Dr. Dosovitz
24          found significant.
25                Mr. Johnstone, on cross-examination,

 1          asked him about, well, didn't it materially
 2          affect his lifestyle?  Weren't there people
 3          that wouldn't come over to his house because
 4          they didn't want to go to a house where a guy
 5          smoked?
 6                And Dr. Dosovitz said, well, you know
 7          what, the guy had a rich social life.  You
 8          remember he went to Minos' restaurant to sit
 9          and chat with Minos and his wife, Jeanne, in
10          Greek, smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee.
11                He was described as a guy who had a
12          social life, went to church, et cetera.
13          Dr. Dosovitz said, you know what, a two-hour
14          long service, if you get up at an hour and go
15          and get a cigarette, that is, to me, an
16          indication of control, not an indication of
17          addiction.
18                It's a judgment call.  It's a true
19          judgment call.  And that's exactly what you
20          guys now have to make, because Judge Streitfeld
21          isn't going to give you an instruction that
22          says this is how you determine whether or not
23          somebody -- whether or not Mr. Dos -- I'm
24          sorry, whether or not Mr. Hatziyannakis was
25          addicted or not.

 1                You're going to have to -- you've
 2          listened to all the evidence, now you're going
 3          to have to make a determination.  I know that's
 4          kind of hard, because ordinarily on everything
 5          else, you're going to get guidance.  On this
 6          one, you don't.
 7                Okay.  Dr. Dosovitz also said, you know
 8          what, I also look to see exactly how committed
 9          you are to quitting, and so I look for how many
10          methods you've attempted in order to quit.  If
11          you're really committed to quitting, if you try
12          cold turkey and you fail, you know if you're
13          really committed to quitting, you're going to
14          do something else.
15                You're going to try the patch, you're
16          going to go for professional help, you're going
17          to ask for a prescription, you're going to go
18          to a clinic, you're going to do something.
19                He talks to these folks every day.  Every
20          day.  But Mr. Hatziyannakis didn't do any of
21          those things.  They suggested because he didn't
22          know about any of them.
23                I leave that to you to decide whether
24          that seems credible or not for an intelligent
25          guy.  You know, when he got here in 1981, how

 1          old was he?  He was 45 years old.  Forty-five
 2          years old, in 1981, when he came to the United
 3          States and became a permanent resident, a
 4          citizen.  Forty-five years old.  He's no kid.
 5          This is not a case involving somebody who's 15
 6          and deciding, without information, whether or
 7          not he's going to smoke a Marlboro or not.
 8                This is a gentleman who is 45 years old,
 9          making the decision when he returns here from
10          Greece, whether he's going to smoke a Marlboro
11          or not.
12                Okay.  I'll go to the verdict form and
13          I'm just going to walk through it.  You've been
14          very patient with me.  I appreciate it.
15                All right.  Mr. Johnstone said both of
16          these questions should be answered "yes."  I
17          would suggest to you that both of these answers
18          should be answered "no."  In fact, if you
19          answer this one "no," you don't have to do
20          anything else, because that's the end of it.
21                Even if you were to decide that
22          Mr. Hatziyannakis was addicted and that his
23          addiction was a legal cause of him getting
24          cancer and dying, you've got to ask yourself,
25          well, what addiction was it?

 1                I mean, they've already said he was
 2          addicted before he ever got to the United
 3          States, so what addiction compelled him to
 4          continue to smoke?  If that's what you
 5          conclude, what addiction compelled him to
 6          continue to smoke?
 7                So, I think the answer to that one would
 8          be "no" even if the answer to that one was
 9          "yes."
10                And this one says:  Please state whether
11          the negligence of Philip Morris was --
12                Oh, and by the way, any findings that --
13          by another jury at another point in time have
14          nothing to do with answering these questions.
15          These are just yours to answer alone, period.
16                Next question says:  Was the negligence
17          of Philip Morris a legal cause, a legal cause,
18          a legal cause, a legal cause, of
19          Mr. Hatziyannakis' death.
20                Well, you would have to find --
21                And here's a guy who they've said has
22          full responsibility for everything he does,
23          except when he's here in the United States; and
24          then they're claiming that Philip Morris ought
25          to take on the responsibility because they're

 1          the maker of the cigarettes that he smokes in
 2          the United States.  Puzzling.
 3                You would have to find that all of a
 4          sudden they become the legal cause, they become
 5          the substantial reason why he gets lung cancer.
 6          Does that make any sense?  But the
 7          manufacturers of the cigarettes that he smokes
 8          in Greece, Canada, Venezuela, are not, even
 9          though Dr. Burns said they all contributed to
10          him getting his cancer.
11                So, I think the answer to all of these
12          questions is "no," and then you come to, please
13          state whether Mr. Hatziyannakis reasonably
14          relied to his detriment -- reasonably relied to
15          his detriment on any statement by Philip Morris
16          which concealed or omitted material information
17          concerning the health effects or addictive
18          nature of smoking cigarettes; and, if so,
19          whether such reliance was a legal cause of his
20          death.
21                Well, Dr. Burns told you the answer to
22          this one.  No one came to the stand and said,
23          yes, he relied on some statement by Philip
24          Morris.  The answer to this one is so obvious,
25          no, that it's -- I mean, all you've got to do

 1          is look at the testimony of Dr. Burns and you
 2          know the answer to that one.
 3                That's the same thing right here.  Please
 4          state whether Mr. Hatziyannakis reasonably
 5          relied to his detriment, reasonably relied to
 6          his detriment, on an act done in furtherance of
 7          an agreement to conceal or omit information
 8          concerning the health effects or addictive
 9          nature of smoking cigarettes; and, if so,
10          whether such reliance was a legal cause of his
11          death.
12                Dr. Burns just told you there's nothing
13          that anybody reported that Mr. Hatziyannakis
14          ever said that he relied in any way, that he
15          even heard anything from Philip Morris or any
16          other cigarette manufacturer, much less relied
17          on something that was said or unsaid.
18                Number 8 says:  Was there gross
19          negligence by Philip Morris; and, if so, was
20          that gross negligence a legal cause of
21          Mr. Hatziyannakis' death.
22                And, again, you have to make up your own
23          mind about this entirely.  What is it?  What is
24          it that Philip Morris did in connection with
25          Mr. Hatziyannakis that Mr. Hatziyannakis

 1          ever --
 2                What was his total interaction with
 3          Philip Morris?  It was he saw ads with cowboys,
 4          and he bought cigarettes manufactured by Philip
 5          Morris.  That is it.
 6                The same type of cigarettes that he
 7          bought everywhere else in the world, the same
 8          cigarettes that Dr. Burns said equally
 9          contributed to him getting his cancer and
10          dying; and yet those companies are not being
11          held responsible in any way, no claim, they're
12          accepting full responsibility for his smoking
13          of those companies' products, those companies'
14          cigarettes.
15                And yet Philip Morris does the same
16          thing, makes the cigarettes that he buys, and
17          they're supposed to be grossly negligent now.
18                Then you have to assign a percentage of
19          responsibility of Mr. Hatziyannakis and to
20          Philip Morris, if you get this far on the
21          verdict form.
22                And Mr. Johnstone said, well, I think
23          that the split should be 25/75, 75 percent on
24          Philip Morris, although he accepts full
25          responsibility for all the cigarettes

 1          manufactured by all the companies outside the
 2          United States.  How can that be?  How can it --
 3          I mean, it's --
 4                The idea that all of a sudden when he
 5          gets to the United States, he looks in the
 6          mirror --
 7                Up to that point, it's only
 8          Mr. Hatziyannakis looking in the mirror,
 9          deciding whether he's going to smoke; and now,
10          all of a sudden Philip Morris takes on a 75 --
11          must be more than that, it must be a hundred
12          percent responsible to get a 75/25 split.  Must
13          be a hundred percent responsible for
14          Mr. Hatziyannakis deciding he's going to smoke
15          cigarettes in the United States.
16                I just don't understand how it's
17          different for the manufacturers outside the
18          United States, the manufacturers -- and Philip
19          Morris inside the United States, when the
20          products are the same, the results are the
21          same, and Mr. Hatziyannakis sees nothing more
22          than ads with warnings on them.  That's the --
23          that's the entire interaction.
24                Now, I'm not standing here and telling
25          you that everything that Philip Morris ever

 1          said or failed to say about the health risks of
 2          smoking was right or that they would do it
 3          today or they've done it in the last ten years,
 4          I'm not doing that.  I told you that in my
 5          opening statement.  But there has to be a legal
 6          cause requirement.  It has to have an impact on
 7          Mr. Hatziyannakis.  It has to.  And you can't
 8          overlook that in doing your job.  That's just
 9          the way it is.  That's the law.  And that's
10          your responsibility.
11                If you get this far in the case,
12          Mr. Johnstone said you should put 10 million
13          here, 10 million here, two-and-a-half million
14          here, two-and-a-half million here.  You know
15          what?  I'm not going to comment on that.
16          You're a wise jury, you'll make a wise
17          decision.
18                Yes, this number is 114,000, we agreed to
19          it, but that doesn't mean we agree that that's
20          a number that -- that you should award in this
21          case.  That's all controlled by the prior
22          answers to the prior questions.
23                And then we come to the final question:
24          Under the circumstances of this case, please
25          state whether you find by clear and convincing

 1          evidence that punitive damages are warranted
 2          against Philip Morris USA.
 3                And this is the punitive damage standard.
 4          Intentional misconduct -- and you'll get this
 5          exact language -- intentional misconduct means
 6          that Philip Morris USA, Incorporated, had
 7          actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of the
 8          conduct and there was a high probability of
 9          injury or damage to Christos Hatziyannakis,
10          and, despite that knowledge, it intentionally
11          pursued that course of conduct, resulting in
12          injury or damage.
13                Philip Morris made the same kinds of
14          cigarettes that all the other manufacturers
15          did.  There's not even a whisper of
16          responsibility on our part.
17                Mr. Hatziyannakis has accepted full
18          responsibility for doing the very same thing
19          that they did, they want to hold --
20                In connection with Mr. Hatziyannakis,
21          they want to hold Philip Morris and punish
22          them, punish them.
23                All right.  You know what?  You've been
24          very patient and very attentive, once again, as
25          usual, and, so, let me conclude this.

 1                And Lucy was very kind to let me make the
 2          entire closing argument.  You know she wanted
 3          to do this.
 4                Okay.  I'm going to sit down.
 5          Mr. Johnstone gets a second bite at the apple,
 6          he gets to get back up and he gets to talk to
 7          you again.  Why?  Because they have the burden
 8          of proof in this case.  They have the burden to
 9          prove to you that everything I just said to you
10          is wrong, everything I just said is just flat
11          wrong.
12                They have the burden of proving this case
13          to you, most of it by the greater weight of the
14          evidence.  This punitive damages -- some of
15          these punitive damage issues are by clear and
16          convincing evidence, an even much higher
17          standard.
18                And that's why he gets a second bite.  I
19          don't know what he's going to do in his closing
20          argument.  He may show you more old documents,
21          he may say, well, here's the difference between
22          the manufacturers in Europe and South America
23          and Canada and Philip Morris.
24                But you know what?  At the bottom,
25          bottom, bottom line, ask yourself -- number

 1          one, ask yourself, what's the interaction with
 2          Mr. Hatziyannakis?  He saw these ads, he smoked
 3          their cigarettes.  That's it.  In Canada, he
 4          sees their ads, he smokes their cigarettes.
 5          They're equally as dangerous, equally as
 6          potentially addictive.  In Greece, same story.
 7          In Venezuela, same story.  Same story.
 8                He may get up and show you more old
 9          documents.  I just ask you to ask yourself
10          this:  When you're looking at that document,
11          ask yourself, where is Mr. Hatziyannakis?  What
12          does this document have to do with
13          Mr. Hatziyannakis?
14                For example, the testimony of the CEO's
15          before Congress, where was Mr. Hatziyannakis?
16          He had already died.  That -- that clip, he
17          didn't show you the clip, he gave you the quote
18          of the guy commenting on the -- being
19          interviewed after the Surgeon General's report,
20          where was Mr. Hatziyannakis in 1964?  He's in
21          either Greece or Venezuela.  He's not here,
22          watching American television.
23                He may put up an old ad or something.
24          Ask yourself, where is Mr. Hatziyannakis?  Does
25          Mr. Hatziyannakis see this?

 1                He showed you the Frank Statement.  1954.
 2          Where was Mr. Hatziyannakis?  He's either in
 3          Greece or Venezuela.  Is there any evidence in
 4          this case that Mr. Hatziyannakis saw the Frank
 5          Statement?
 6                THE CLERK:  You're at 75 minutes,
 7          counsel.
 8                MR. REILLY:  Thank you.  I'm so close to
 9          done, as you can tell.
10                Okay.  Please just ask yourselves that,
11          because neither Lucy nor I get to get back up
12          again, and say, wait a minute, wait a minute.
13                Okay.  Thank you very much.
