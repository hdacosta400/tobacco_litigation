14                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Good morning, counsel.
15          Ladies, good morning.
16                Our firm has represented clients here in
17          Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, Miami, Palm
18          Beach, for 50 years.  And we are proud to speak
19          for folks that believe in good faith that
20          they've been injured or killed or harmed by the
21          reckless or intentional misconduct or
22          negligence of others.
23                And I'm proud to appear in court before
24          you and His Honor, and I thank you, and, more
25          importantly, the family thanks you for your

 1          service.
 2                You folks have taken notes day in and day
 3          out, you've been here on time, you all have
 4          jobs --
 5                THE COURT:  Mostly.
 6                MR. JOHNSTONE:  College students have
 7          other things going on.  In any case, you folks
 8          have been fantastic.
 9                And I want you to remember that when we
10          went back through the jury selection process,
11          each of the attorneys, Mr. Reilly and I had a
12          chance to speak directly with you, and with the
13          Judge's help -- and we've gotten a lot of his
14          help, things you don't even know about, with
15          the law -- we were able to agree on you seven
16          folks that everyone seemed to believe would be
17          the most suited, the most qualified to sit as
18          jurors in this case, and we thank you very
19          much.  You've done a fantastic job.
20                Mr. Reilly told you in his opening
21          statement that you wield tremendous power, and
22          that's one of the things that he and I can
23          agree on in this case.
24                You are judges of the facts, and that's
25          why each time you came and went, we rose, just

 1          as we did for His Honor.
 2                You're not wearing black robes, but, in
 3          essence, really, you serve as judges of the
 4          facts; and then, as you've been told and will
 5          learn a little bit more today, you'll have a
 6          chance to take all of the law -- and some of
 7          it's a little bit confusing, a little bit
 8          complicated -- and apply it to the facts, to do
 9          what?  To reach a verdict that is just and true
10          based on the evidence that was presented.
11                Now, this is one of the very few, if not
12          the only, countries in the world, that give lay
13          people in the community, citizens that live in
14          the same area as those involved in the case,
15          the power to make decisions of this magnitude.
16          And you do wield tremendous power.
17                And we believe, the family believes, that
18          that power that you wield will be wielded in
19          this case justly and fairly, and that based on
20          the evidence you will hold Philip Morris
21          responsible to some degree for Chris' death.
22                Now, when we pursued this case against
23          this tobacco company, we made it very clear
24          from the outset, to anybody and everybody
25          involved, that Chris Hatziyannakis is, to some

 1          extent, responsible for his own death.  And
 2          we've said that since day one.
 3                The first decision that he made, put a
 4          cigarette in his mouth when he was being
 5          pressured, as so many people are, with peer
 6          pressure from friends, guys he works with, was
 7          his decision alone.  He had the control to do
 8          that, and it was a mistake.
 9                And Chris Hatziyannakis paid for that
10          mistake.  He paid the ultimate price by
11          developing a particularly aggressive, virulent
12          deadly lung cancer that killed him over about a
13          six-month period, from the time when he first
14          started hacking and coughing up blood, until
15          the time that he died at the hospital, holding
16          his wife's hand, he paid the price.
17                Now, we've admitted some fault, and I'll
18          talk to you about that a little bit later, and
19          ask you to consider the fault of Philip Morris.
20                Now, Philip Morris has not accepted the
21          slightest responsibility at any time, ever, for
22          Chris' death.  They have continued to argue
23          since the day that we have attempted to hold
24          them responsible, that it's his problem, it's
25          his wife's problem, it's the family, Jim's

 1          problem, his son, it's not their problem.
 2                And they don't -- you can tell from the
 3          evidence and by what they've done in this
 4          case -- they don't care that their product
 5          killed this man.
 6                MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
 7          "Care."
 8                THE COURT:  Overruled.
 9                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Philip Morris called a
10          single witness, an expert witness that was
11          hired in the Washington area, near one of their
12          offices, to come in and tell you what?  That
13          this man was not addicted to any cigarettes and
14          was not addicted to Philip Morris' cigarettes,
15          Marlboros.
16                They did not even have a corporate
17          representative, anybody from the company,
18          sitting here during this trial.  And that is
19          evidence that they do not care.
20                THE COURT:  Okay.  That's sustained.  No
21          more of that.
22                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Yes, sir.  They called --
23                THE COURT:  They have a right to defend
24          themselves.
25                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Indeed, they do.

 1                THE COURT:  So, focus on the evidence.
 2                MR. JOHNSTONE:  The evidence is they did
 3          not call any witnesses of any kind after 14
 4          years, 15 years, Chris has been dead, they did
 5          not call a single witness to go through all of
 6          their documents, their statements, their
 7          positions, to explain them to you, to describe
 8          what their thinking was or anything.  They
 9          didn't do that.
10                And even today, as Mr. Reilly gets up,
11          he's going to suggest to you that Philip Morris
12          bears no responsibility whatsoever for this
13          man's death, and that's not what the evidence
14          has been.
15                Now, I want to show you the verdict form
16          and I want to show you a little bit of law, so
17          you understand what you're being asked to do.
18                Let's take a look, if we can, at CL40,
19          please.
20                Now, this is the verdict form.  I don't
21          think you folks have seen this, and I think
22          it's important that as we go through this
23          closing argument that I'm offering here on
24          behalf of the family this morning, that you get
25          a better feel of what it is you're being asked

 1          to do, so we can discuss the issues in light of
 2          what the verdict form and the law is.
 3                Now, can you enlarge that so that we can
 4          see what the -- what it says, please?
 5                This is the verdict form.  Now, each of
 6          you jurors that retire to deliberate will have
 7          a chance to go over all the evidence and the
 8          law and to talk among yourselves to reach a
 9          unanimous verdict.  You must reach a decision
10          that all of you agree on on each of these
11          issues.  This isn't a state where you can come
12          back four to two or something like that.  Each
13          of you have to agree on each of the issues.
14                So, the first issue you're being asked to
15          decide in this case:  Was Christos
16          Hatziyannakis addicted to cigarettes containing
17          nicotine; and, if so, was such addiction a
18          legal cause of his death.
19                What has the overwhelming evidence been
20          in the case?  We know that by the time Chris
21          got to Canada and smoked in Canada before
22          coming to this country in 1973, '74, he was
23          addicted to cigarettes.  That's when he smoked
24          full time, that's when he had cigarette packs
25          in his pocket.

 1                And you know from the evidence and from
 2          your own experience and your own common sense
 3          that he was addicted to cigarettes by the time
 4          that he got to this country.
 5                And he stepped off the plane in 1973, and
 6          the first thing he saw in Times Square was the
 7          huge billboard with the smoke billowing from
 8          the cowboy's mouth that he saw with his son,
 9          Harry.
10                And he became addicted to what?  The next
11          question.  He became addicted, in this country,
12          to cigarettes containing nicotine manufactured
13          by Philip Morris.
14                He was addicted to all of the cigarettes
15          that he smoked, including Philip Morris
16          Marlboro cigarettes in this country.
17                So, these are the first two questions.
18          And how are you to decide this?  You are to
19          decide these two questions by the greater
20          weight of the evidence, what is more probable.
21          Was he probably addicted to cigarettes
22          containing nicotine; and was he probably, more
23          likely than not based on all the evidence,
24          addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine
25          manufactured by Philip Morris?

 1                Those are the first two questions.  And
 2          they're very, very important.  And all of your
 3          subsequent decisions in the case really, for
 4          the most part, are based on answering these
 5          first two questions.
 6                Can we see the next page, please?
 7                THE COURT:  If I might make a suggestion,
 8          the verdict form, of course, will be given to
 9          you in the jury room, as will my instructions,
10          so I see you feverishly notetaking.  The idea
11          is to still be able to move your right or left
12          hand by noon.  So, just some caution there.
13                MR. JOHNSTONE:  That's a good point.
14          Thanks, Judge.  Appreciate it.
15                You guys were able to take notes, and you
16          guys were able to ask questions, and you are
17          going to get the instructions and you're going
18          to get the jury verdict form.
19                So, I'm just trying to get you acclimated
20          right now as we listen to the evidence and
21          what's been in the case as to what you're being
22          asked to do.
23                So, those are the first two questions.
24          Was he addicted to cigarettes containing
25          nicotine at all, period; and was he addicted to

 1          the Marlboros.
 2                And I'll show you, in due course, that he
 3          was, indeed, addicted.  In fact, if Chris
 4          wasn't addicted, who was?  If Chris
 5          Hatziyannakis was not addicted to cigarettes,
 6          and addicted to Marlboros that contain
 7          nicotine, for all those years that he smoked,
 8          who in the heck is?
 9                We learned from both experts and from the
10          DSM that the vast majority of people who smoke
11          with any regularity are what?  Dependent.
12                I'll talk about Dr. Dosovitz in a minute,
13          but he made it clear that when we're talking
14          about the word "addiction," it means dependent,
15          was he dependent on.
16                Now, there is no agreement in this case
17          about what addiction is.  You'll get different
18          definitions and different phrases and different
19          descriptions of addiction depending on who you
20          speak to.
21                But what's very simple and very easy to
22          remember is that everyone agrees that if you
23          are dependent to any degree on cigarettes, you
24          are addicted.
25                And that's the word I would like you to

 1          remember when you try to figure out was he
 2          addicted, was he dependent.
 3                Third question:  You're going to be asked
 4          to decide whether Philip Morris was negligent;
 5          you're going to be asked, in Number 4, to
 6          decide if the product that they sold was
 7          defective and unreasonably dangerous.
 8                Then can we go to the next page, please?
 9                You'll be asked to decide whether the
10          cigarettes that Philip Morris sold to Chris for
11          all those years, beginning in '73, up through
12          '78, '79, and then again from '81 up until the
13          time of his death, were defective due to being
14          unfit for the uses intended or reasonably
15          foreseeable.
16                All right.  Number 6.  Did Chris
17          reasonably rely to his detriment on any
18          statements of Philip Morris in this regard.
19                May we see the next, please?
20                I hope this helps you understand what
21          you're being asked to decide.
22                Number 7:  Please state whether Chris
23          reasonably relied to his detriment on any act
24          done.  We'll talk about that.  Was there gross
25          negligence by Philip Morris; and, if so, was

 1          that gross negligence, was that intentional
 2          misconduct a cause of Chris' death.
 3                All right.  And let's see the next
 4          question.  There will be, on the jury verdict
 5          form, an opportunity for you to hold both
 6          parties responsible, both Chris and Philip
 7          Morris.
 8                There is no other party, no other
 9          manufacturer, both within this country and
10          manufacturers of cigarettes outside the
11          country, that anyone is suggesting is
12          responsible legally for this man's death.
13                So, let me say it again.  The only two
14          decisions you have to make on the apportionment
15          of responsibility is between Chris and Philip
16          Morris.  There will be no other manufacturers
17          or cigarette brands in this case on this
18          verdict form for your consideration.
19                And you may, if you like, when you get to
20          the jury verdict room, go right to this page
21          and check for Chris Hatziyannakis, "yes,"
22          absolutely, was he negligent.
23                We have conceded that and admitted that
24          since day one.  And it will be up to you folks
25          to determine what that percentage is.  We'll

 1          talk about that a little bit later; and then
 2          you'll have a chance, at this point, to
 3          actually determine to what extent the family is
 4          entitled to compensation.
 5                And, further, whether Philip Morris acted
 6          recklessly, acted with knowledge that their
 7          behavior may well have hurt their customers,
 8          whether they were grossly negligent, whether
 9          they committed fraud, all right?
10                And if you find that, you may check that
11          in this case Philip Morris, to some extent,
12          should be punished for its behavior by the
13          award of punitive damages.  So, I hope that
14          helps.
15                Now, let's go up to CL3, please.
16                Now, you will hear from His Honor that if
17          you find in the first two questions that we
18          talked about, was there negligence -- excuse
19          me, was Chris addicted to cigarettes that
20          contain nicotine, and was he addicted to
21          Marlboros, if you find that that's true, that
22          he was, based on the evidence in the case,
23          which I'll talk about, you must consider these
24          findings.  These findings are binding on you,
25          and I'm going to read them to you very quickly.

 1                If you make those determinations to the
 2          first two questions, then you will consider
 3          this:  Smoking cigarettes --
 4                Because these have been findings in
 5          another case that Your Honor told you about
 6          that are binding in this case.
 7                Smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer.
 8          Now we know that now.  Nicotine in cigarettes
 9          is addictive.  It is addictive.  And, in fact,
10          the first two have been admitted in this case
11          by Philip Morris.
12                Dr. Dosovitz wanted to argue about
13          whether nicotine may be addictive or is
14          addictive.  It is.  They admit it, their expert
15          wouldn't, but they admit it.  And these are
16          findings binding on you.
17                Next, Philip Morris placed cigarettes on
18          the market that were defective and unreasonably
19          dangerous.
20                Next, Philip Morris concealed or omitted
21          material information not otherwise known or
22          available, knowing that the material was false
23          or misleading, or failed to disclose a material
24          fact concerning the health effects or addictive
25          nature of smoking cigarettes or both.

 1                Next, you will consider, and it's binding
 2          on you jurors in this case, Philip Morris
 3          agreed to conceal or omit information regarding
 4          the health effects of cigarettes or their
 5          addictive nature with the intention that
 6          smokers and the public would rely on this
 7          information to their detriment.
 8                These are all findings that have already
 9          been made.  And, again, they're binding on you
10          if you answer "yes" to the first two questions.
11          He was addicted to cigarettes, and he was
12          addicted to Philip Morris' Marlboros.
13                You also must realize that you are bound
14          by this finding:  Philip Morris sold or
15          supplied cigarettes that were defective.
16          Philip Morris sold or supplied cigarettes that,
17          at the time of the sale or supply, did not
18          conform to representations of fact made by
19          Philip Morris.
20                And, lastly, you are bound by the finding
21          that Philip Morris was negligent.
22                Now, what I would like to do is to go
23          through some of the evidence with you now,
24          please.  And I'm going to stand over here out
25          of the way, so you all can see.

 1                I would like to go and discuss with you
 2          kind of in chronological order, so we can kind
 3          of remember what we talked about, beginning --
 4          I think it was -- I think it was Wednesday of
 5          last week with Dr. Burns.  We're going to pick
 6          up kind of there.
 7                Now, a lot of information, but it's
 8          important information, so I'm going to spend a
 9          little time with you on it.
10                In this case, Philip Morris has admitted
11          the following:  These are stipulated facts that
12          they have decided to admit in this case.
13                Here's what they've said:  We agree with
14          Despina that nicotine in cigarettes is
15          addictive.  We agree that smoking cigarettes
16          can cause lung cancer.  We agree that Chris
17          died from a primary lung cancer for which
18          cigarette smoking was the medical cause.
19                Now, that's been the evidence, you've
20          seen the medical records, portions of them, and
21          the death certificate.
22                He died of cigarette smoke that he
23          consumed for more than 30 years, most of which
24          were comprised of Marlboro cigarettes.
25                Number 4:  Marlboro cigarettes, which

 1          were manufactured by Philip Morris USA, and
 2          sold in the U.S., were a substantial
 3          contributing of Chris Hatziyannakis' lung
 4          cancer.
 5                All right.  That's important, because the
 6          first two questions are was he addicted to
 7          cigarettes that contain nicotine and Marlboros
 8          that were a legal cause of his death.  That's
 9          what you're going to see on the verdict form I
10          showed you, and the law that's given you by the
11          Judge.
12                And Philip Morris has actually admitted
13          in this case everything but the last element,
14          that he was addicted.  And they've done that
15          because if you find that he wasn't addicted,
16          despite the overwhelming evidence, they walk
17          out of the courtroom and they're not legally
18          responsible for compensating the family.
19                Marlboro cigarettes, which were
20          manufactured by Philip Morris and sold here to
21          Chris, were a contributing, substantial
22          contributing cause of his lung cancer and
23          death.
24                He didn't die of any other lung cancer,
25          from any other cigarettes, he died of lung

 1          cancer from Marlboro cigarettes that he smoked
 2          predominantly in his adult life.
 3                The last thing that Philip Morris has
 4          admitted and has stipulated to is the
 5          following:  Philip Morris admits that it is not
 6          claiming and will not suggest to you here in
 7          this courtroom that any other American brands,
 8          Kent, Camel, Winston, or any other cigarettes
 9          smoked by Chris in America caused or
10          contributed to cause his lung cancer.
11                And they did that, of course, because for
12          the last 50 years they have worked in unison --
13                MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
14                THE COURT:  Sustained.
15                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Now, Mr. Reilly may try
16          to attempt to tell you that foreign brands of
17          cigarettes caused or contributed to cause his
18          death, and that's for you to decide, and it may
19          or may not be true; but the major competent,
20          substantial contributing cause of Chris' death
21          was smoking Marlboros.
22                And it's important, after we go through
23          this evidence, on judgment day, that you hold
24          this company accountable for its conduct, and
25          for its behavior and for its peddling of this

 1          poison to this man.
 2                Now, let's go to the next exhibit.
 3              (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
 4          taken down to the best of the reporter's
 5          ability as follows:)
 6                Let me begin my questioning on the matter
 7          of whether or not nicotine is addictive.  Let
 8          me ask you first, and I would like to just go
 9          down the row, whether each of you believes that
10          nicotine is not addictive.
11                I've heard virtually all of you touch on
12          it, and just "yes" or "no," do you believe
13          nicotine is not addictive?
14                I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.
15                Mr. Johnston?
16                Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine
17          clearly do not meet the classic definitions of
18          addiction.  There is no intoxication.
19                We'll take that as a "no," and, again,
20          time is short, if you could just -- I think
21          each of you believe nicotine is not addictive,
22          I just would like to have this for the record.
23                I don't believe that nicotine or our
24          products are addictive.
25                I believe nicotine is not addictive.

 1                I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
 2                I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
 3                And I, too, believe that nicotine is not
 4          addictive.
 5                MR. JOHNSTONE:  There's the Philip Morris
 6          CEO, who sells Marlboros, testifying under
 7          oath, in a congressional hearing, that
 8          cigarette smoking is not addictive.  It's a
 9          lie.  It's a lie.  It is addictive, and this
10          man was horribly addictive, and there are
11          grades of addiction.
12                Dr. Dosovitz's testimony the other day
13          regarding whether he was addicted and whether
14          there are degrees of addiction makes no sense.
15          You know better.  You have common sense that
16          you can use in this case.  We all know smokers
17          who are addicted, we've all seen it, we can
18          smell it, we know what it looks like.
19                And like Justice Potter, the Supreme
20          Court justice, who, when asked to describe what
21          pornography is and said, I'm not sure exactly
22          what it is, but I know it when I see it, we
23          know addiction in this courtroom when we see
24          it.
25                And Chris Hatziyannakis was addicted to

 1          cigarettes, the vast majority of his life, and
 2          to the cigarettes that Philip Morris sold him
 3          when he got off the plane in New York.
 4                Next exhibit, please.
 5                So, in public -- in public, Philip Morris
 6          is saying nicotine is not addictive.  And they
 7          did that right up until the time that they were
 8          involuntarily made to admit the truth, after
 9          Chris' death.
10                They never told Chris or their other
11          smokers, their other customers, that this was a
12          powerful drug, as powerful as cocaine,
13          morphine, heroin, and that addiction would hook
14          him and make it very, very difficult, if not
15          impossible, to quit smoking.  They never told
16          him that.  They did the exact opposite.  But
17          they knew better.
18                And inside, for years, going back to the
19          50's and 60's, their private documents, their
20          corporate documents that were generated by
21          many, many of their employees, that we finally
22          were able to show you in this courtroom, said
23          what?
24                Can you blow up the first two, please?
25                This is their internal documentation that

 1          they never shared with Chris or anybody else
 2          until they were made to.
 3                Nicotine is a powerful pharmacologic
 4          agent with multiple sites of action and may be
 5          the most important component of cigarette
 6          smoke.
 7                The cigarette should be conceived not as
 8          a product but as a package.
 9                The product is nicotine.  Internal
10          document:  I am told, that the entire matter of
11          addiction is the most potent weapon a
12          prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer
13          case.  We can't defend continued smoking as
14          free choice if the person was addicted.
15                Now, I want you to think about that for
16          just a minute.  I'm not a prosecuting attorney,
17          but I am an attorney speaking on behalf of the
18          Hatziyannakis family.  And Mr. Reilly, and his
19          able partners, are speaking on behalf of Philip
20          Morris; and he has told you repeatedly, in
21          essence, both in opening and through his
22          questions to the witnesses, that Chris had free
23          will, that Chris could quit smoking any time he
24          wanted, that Chris had a choice, a free choice,
25          to smoke or not to smoke.  That isn't true.

 1          The internal documents -- bless you -- the
 2          internal documents, going way back to the 60's
 3          and 70's, show that Philip Morris knew that we
 4          cannot defend continued smoking as free choice,
 5          which is what's being done in this courtroom if
 6          the person was addicted because that free
 7          choice is eroded, it's impeded.
 8                Chris didn't know that there are
 9          nicotinic receptors in his lungs and his brain,
10          and that every time he took a hit of nicotine
11          that washed through his lungs and in his brain,
12          he was becoming more deeply addicted.  He had
13          no idea.  Not a clue.
14                And Philip Morris knew and continued to
15          sell these products, knowing that they would
16          hook the most vulnerable, and that there was a
17          strong likelihood over time that they would die
18          of some smoking-related disease.
19                At the bottom, another internal document.
20          Do we really want to tout cigarette smoke as a
21          drug?  They didn't want to do that, but it is,
22          of course.  They say it is, of course.
23                Next document, please.  This is blown up,
24          so that you can see.
25                My remarks in this summation are not

 1          directed at any of the defense attorneys.  Fine
 2          attorneys, reputable folks.  Don't mistake what
 3          I'm saying.  But, in fact, the attorneys acting
 4          on behalf of Philip Morris are attempting in
 5          this courtroom with you to defend the
 6          indefensible.  That's what they've done for the
 7          entire week and a half, two weeks we've been
 8          here.
 9                We cannot defend continued smoking as
10          free choice if the person was addicted.  But
11          that's what they're doing in this courtroom
12          today, despite knowing for 25 or 30 years that
13          that's an illegitimate position to take.
14                Next document.
15              (Thereupon, the video deposition was played
16          and taken down to the best of the reporter's
17          ability as follows:)
18          Q.    Were you employed by Philip Morris USA?
19          A.    Yes.
20                MR. REILLY:  Objection.
21                THE COURT:  I'm sorry?
22                MR. REILLY:  I don't believe you permit
23          playing videos.
24                THE COURT:  Overruled.  Incorrect.
25                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Would you start again,

 1          please?
 2                THE COURT:  That's testimony they may
 3          present.
 4              (Thereupon, the video deposition was played
 5          and taken down to the best of the reporter's
 6          ability as follows:)
 7          Q.    Were you employed by Philip Morris USA?
 8          A.    Yes.
 9          Q.    Do cigarettes contain nicotine?
10          A.    Yes.
11          Q.    Does nicotine find its way into the lungs
12   through anything other than tobacco?
13          A.    Not that I'm aware of, no.
14          Q.    Are there receptors for nicotine in your
15   lungs?
16          A.    Yes.
17          Q.    Are there things added to the tobacco
18   that goes into cigarettes which contribute to the
19   addictive properties of cigarettes?
20          A.    In my opinion, yes.
21          Q.    Are those additives put into cigarettes
22   by the cigarette companies for that purpose, to
23   enhance the addictive nature of smoking?
24          A.    In my opinion, yes.
25          Q.    Is the rate at which nicotine enters the

 1   body and gets into the system, to the brain, so to
 2   speak, something that the cigarette companies enhance
 3   or control?
 4          A.    They control them, yes.  And enhance it.
 5          Q.    All right.  And who is in control of
 6   these design parameters?
 7          A.    The manufacturer.
 8          Q.    Earlier in your testimony you mentioned
 9   that nicotine was manipulated.
10          A.    Yes.
11          Q.    Is urea another additive that's used in
12   cigarettes?
13          A.    Yes, it is.
14          Q.    And what was the purpose of putting urea
15   in the cigarette?
16          A.    When you burn urea, it makes ammonia.
17   And ammonia, as we've talked about a little bit
18   earlier, can change the characteristics of nicotine.
19   It can help remove nicotine from tobacco, and it can
20   also change it to the free-base form, which makes it
21   transmit across tissue faster.
22          Q.    Was urea added for that purpose, to
23   free-base the nicotine?
24          A.    Yeah.  They didn't need it for any other
25   purpose.  So, yes.

 1          Q.    And did the people that you worked with
 2   at Philip Morris, that were involved in it, did they
 3   believe or express to you that they believed that that
 4   helped them sell cigarettes?
 5          A.    Yes.
 6          Q.    And did they express to you that they
 7   knew that smoking was, in fact, addictive?
 8          A.    Yes.
 9          Q.    And did they think that -- that these
10   compounds, ammonia, urea and so forth enhanced the
11   addictive nature of cigarettes?
12          A.    Yes.
13                MR. JOHNSTONE:  That's outrageous.  Was
14          Chris Hatziyannakis in control of how these
15          cigarettes were manufactured, so that the smoke
16          was like free-base that hit his lungs and then
17          his brain and hooked him right up until the
18          time that he died?
19                This was a man who was so addicted to
20          Marlboro cigarettes that even after he got the
21          lung cancer diagnosis, and was shocked and
22          frightened, his addiction was so strong, he
23          continued to smoke.
24                And we know that from Clio, who was
25          sitting next to him as he met with his

 1          physician before radiation therapy.
 2                The only time that he quit smoking
 3          permanently after these cigarettes were
 4          manipulated and additives were included with
 5          the tobacco to hook him was when he had
 6          radiation therapy to his chest, which made him
 7          so deathly ill, so sick, he couldn't swallow,
 8          he couldn't eat, and he certainly couldn't
 9          smoke.  That's how addicted this man was.
10                Do any of you really believe for an
11          instant, after hearing all of this evidence,
12          that Chris was never addicted to any degree on
13          cigarettes?  He wasn't dependent on Marlboro
14          cigarettes, that he was hiding from his family?
15          Do you really believe that?
16                And why would you believe a witness that
17          is brought in from Washington, Dr. Dosovitz,
18          who is the only person you heard from to ever
19          say he wasn't addicted?
20                Why would you believe a word he said when
21          he's been hired by Philip Morris, who has lied
22          to us for 50 years?  Would you really believe
23          what he said?  Was he credible?  Did you think
24          that his demeanor was convincing?  Do you think
25          he really believed what he was saying?

 1                Juxtapose his comments and his testimony
 2          with Dr. Burns.  And we'll talk about
 3          Dr. Burns, who has worked in the public health
 4          service, and has helped edit or write at least
 5          five separate Surgeon General reports.
 6                Every question that was asked of him, he
 7          was cordial and polite, and answered the
 8          question truthfully and quickly and honestly.
 9          Is that what you watched Dr. Dosovitz do the
10          other day?  And, yes, I was upset.
11                Now, I apologize to any of you if I've
12          said or done anything in this courtroom in any
13          way to upset either the Court or you jurors;
14          but, yes, I was upset, because I watched him,
15          you saw him.
16                MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
17                THE COURT:  Overruled.
18                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Now, let's go to the next
19          exhibit, please.
20                Going back -- and I'm going to move along
21          here -- going back to the 50's, the public
22          statement that Philip Morris offered to all of
23          its customers, and this is an environment that
24          they helped create.  You younger folks may not
25          recall the 50's, 60's and 70's, when everybody

 1          smoked everywhere.
 2                But the public statement that was being
 3          offered by Philip Morris was:  We accept an
 4          interest in people's health as a basic
 5          responsibility paramount to every other
 6          consideration in our business.  We have -- we
 7          have and always will cooperate closely with
 8          those whose task it is to safeguard the public
 9          health.
10                People like Dr. Burns.  A Harvard
11          graduate who wrote a huge chapter in Harrison's
12          textbook.  People like Dr. Burns, who have
13          spoken out in the public health interest since
14          the 70's.
15                Their private remarks, 1977, when the
16          man's here smoking, in New York, hits the
17          tarmac, he is addicted to cigarettes, that's
18          right, and you can hold him responsible for
19          that addiction as he comes to this country.
20                And you must hold these people
21          responsible for the continued addiction that
22          they fostered in him and helped him with and
23          encouraged him with throughout the rest of his
24          lifetime in this country.
25                This family has lived as citizens doing

 1          the right things, as immigrant Greek citizens
 2          in this country, going back to the early 70's.
 3          And I'm asking you to hold Philip Morris
 4          responsible to this family for their
 5          misconduct, because look what they did.
 6                Smoker Psychology Program.  First every
 7          undertaking has to have some mission.  I would
 8          state our charter from Philip Morris in this
 9          fashion:  Study the psychology of the smoker in
10          search of information that can increase
11          corporate profits.
12                Yeah.  That doesn't sound to me as though
13          they will cooperate closely with those whose
14          task it is to safeguard the public health.
15                When I asked Dr. Dosovitz, their paid
16          expert, who they paid something like 70 grand
17          or something to, in this case alone, whether
18          the Surgeon General is a recognized medical
19          expert in this country, he said "yes" on the
20          stand; and we went back to a depo he gave two
21          months ago where he said no, he wasn't, I don't
22          agree with that; is that cooperating closely
23          with those whose task it is to safeguard the
24          public health?
25                Look what else they say at the bottom.

 1          Our position should obviously be supportive of
 2          Jet's for the primitive reason of "Who ain't
 3          for more money?"
 4                Once again, I'm forced of the opinion
 5          that the program --
 6                This is the Tobacco Research Council that
 7          they set up, that was actually starting to
 8          disclose how bad cigarette smoke was and how
 9          addictive it was, one of the folks that worked
10          for Philip Morris said that program seems to be
11          misdirected since its main mission seems to be
12          to prove that smoking causes cancer.
13                Well, of course, it does.  Their
14          cigarettes, they've admitted, caused his lung
15          cancer, but they weren't telling the public
16          that.
17                Next document.  Now, this is another
18          employee of Philip Morris, just like the fellow
19          whose video we just watched a minute ago.  And
20          he was asked in deposition, on the stand, and
21          you can read this for yourself.  Two hundred
22          thirty billion cigarettes Philip Morris sells a
23          year.  We know that they have 50 percent market
24          share, they're the single biggest manufacturer
25          by distribution by volume of cigarettes in the

 1          country.
 2                Next document.  They spent $200 million a
 3          year, at least during this five-year period,
 4          when Chris was smoking their cigarettes, they
 5          spent in or around $200 million a year in
 6          advertising.
 7                Next document.  James Morgan was deposed,
 8          and John and Steve Hammer read portions of
 9          this, and I want to enlarge the second and
10          third paragraph.  Bring it down, please.  Right
11          there.  Those two paragraphs.  Thank you.
12                And there's -- this is all in evidence,
13          you can read them for yourselves.
14                Early on, we were talking about
15          marketing, and I think I used the word
16          "integration."  I think Marlboro integrates its
17          products and total proposition extremely well.
18                What does that mean?  It means it floods
19          the marketplace with their cigarettes and with
20          their advertisements, all of which Chris
21          Hatziyannakis saw in this country all through
22          the 70's and 80's.
23                Secondly, I think its packaging is
24          excellent.  I believe its advertising is
25          excellent.  I believe its sales promotion

 1          programs are excellent.
 2                Can you go to the next paragraph?  Right
 3          down there at the bottom.
 4                We spent -- we spend a lot of money
 5          making sure that things like the tear tape on
 6          the cellophane are always in the right
 7          position, not defective.  We really try to make
 8          that brand the highest quality brand that we
 9          can make.
10                So, if you're asking yourselves, yes,
11          Chris was addicted to cigarettes when he came
12          to this country, why did he start smoking
13          Marlboros, it's because of the concerted
14          attempt to make their brand the most
15          interesting, most well advertised, easiest to
16          open, most consistently addictive, both
17          visually and physically, cigarette that you can
18          buy in America.  And they did it on purpose.
19          And they knew that.  And that's wrong.  It's
20          outrageous.
21                Next exhibit, please.  And so when Chris
22          gets off the airplane, and as he drives down 95
23          and as he heads to Miami or Tampa or to his
24          son's school, what does he see?
25                You may not recall this, some of the

 1          younger folks.  These advertisements were
 2          plastered all over South Florida, and they were
 3          in magazines, and he saw them, and we know that
 4          as a young father he was taken by the American
 5          cowboy, Clint Eastwood and others, that he
 6          admired and tried to emulate.
 7                And what does he see?  He looks at these
 8          and says, gee, that guy looks pretty healthy,
 9          he doesn't look like he's got lung cancer to
10          me, my dad's 98 years old.
11                And he did believe he was going to
12          continue living, and he paid the price.  He
13          paid the ultimate price.  He's in a grave in
14          Memorial -- in Hollywood, after leaving
15          Memorial, that his wife continues to visit all
16          these years later.  He paid the price.
17                What did she do wrong?  Her name isn't on
18          the jury verdict form.
19                MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
20                THE COURT:  Sustained.
21                MR. JOHNSTONE:  What did she do wrong?
22                THE COURT:  Sustained.
23                MR. REILLY:  Motion, Your Honor.
24                THE COURT:  Step in the jury room,
25          please.

 1               (Whereupon, the following proceedings
 2          were had outside the hearing of the jury:)
 3                THE COURT:  I can barely hear you,
 4          Mr. Reilly.
 5                MR. REILLY:  I appreciate --
 6                THE COURT:  You need to keep your energy
 7          level up for at least another day, sir.
 8                MR. REILLY:  Okay.
 9                THE COURT:  Now, what are you talking
10          about?
11                MR. REILLY:  This is the third improper
12          argument that counsel has made.  There is a
13          cumulative effect.  Even though Your Honor has
14          sustained my objections to each of his improper
15          arguments, there is a cumulative effect.  He's
16          violated --
17                THE COURT:  Denied.  Denied.  Denied.
18                MR. REILLY:  Well, the argument --
19                THE COURT:  In fact, the first one I
20          admonished him in front of the jury.
21                MR. REILLY:  You did.
22                THE COURT:  So, it had the exact opposite
23          effect.  It not only cured any prejudice, it
24          let the jury know he did something wrong.
25          Overruled, denied.

 1                Bring the jury out.  You've got to be
 2          careful, Mr. Johnstone.
 3                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Yes, Your Honor.  Thank
 4          you, Judge.
 5               (Whereupon, the following proceedings
 6          were had within the hearing of the jury:)
 7                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Ladies, on the jury
 8          verdict form, as you look at the jury verdict
 9          form, there are two parties or two entities
10          that you are to determine were at fault.  Chris
11          and Philip Morris.  That's it.  Those are the
12          only two parties that you're going to be
13          considering respective fault.
14                And if you make an award in this case,
15          the verdict will be reduced by that respective
16          fault.  For instance, if you were to award a
17          hundred dollars, for the sake of argument, and
18          you found Chris 25 percent responsible, the
19          award to the family would be $75.
20                So, when you attach comparative
21          negligence to the respective parties, and weigh
22          their respective fault, please remember that.
23          That's what happens.  That's what your verdict
24          means.  You hold Chris a percentage
25          responsibility and the award is diminished by

 1          that.
 2                Next exhibit, please.
 3                Again, don't see an oxygen bottle
 4          trailing behind this cowboy.  Looks pretty
 5          healthy, virile, another chiseled cowboy
 6          galloping across the Colorado hillside.
 7                And this is what he saw over and over and
 8          over again, day-in and day-out, and he made a
 9          connection between the strong cowboy actors he
10          saw on TV or in the movies and these
11          advertisements.
12                And so what did he do?
13                Next video, please, or next image.
14                He actually dressed his kid, Harry -- I'm
15          not so sure about Jim, but we know Harry -- in
16          cowboy outfits.
17                Now, it's not the Marlboro outfit, but
18          for a young boy it's pretty close.  He's got
19          his badge and his two six-shooters on his hips;
20          and you can't see it in that photo, but he's
21          got cowboy boots on and his cowboy hat.
22                And even years, years later, 12, 15 years
23          later, Chris had around the house -- or Harry
24          did, because his father had encouraged him to,
25          a cowboy hat, and he's got jeans on and boots,

 1          as well.
 2                Next image, please.
 3                And, so, as Chris, with his addiction
 4          that he's responsible for, that we agree he
 5          should be held responsible for, for smoking
 6          brands outside the country, comes to this
 7          country to raise his two sons, he starts buying
 8          cigarettes by the carton because he's so
 9          addicted.
10                He's terrified that he's going to be
11          without cigarettes during the normal day, so he
12          goes to the Seminole reservation, out on 441,
13          and picks up as many as two or three cartons at
14          a time, so that he's always got cigarettes; and
15          after they go shopping, he hands it to his
16          wife, and you can see the bag with Marlboros
17          inside.
18                Next image, please.  Now, this is the
19          sworn testimony in this courtroom that you
20          heard from Dr. Burns.  Again, you'll have the
21          ability, as you speak to one another in the
22          back, to talk about Dr. Burns and whether you
23          found him to be believable, whether you found
24          him to be a credible witness, whether he
25          answered questions directly, whether he had the

 1          knowledge and experience to comment on
 2          addiction.
 3                This is a pulmonologist who has spent
 4          many years in intensive care units taking care
 5          of smokers with emphysema, and with lung
 6          cancer, and with chronic obstructive pulmonary
 7          disease, who's written and spoken widely on
 8          cigarette smoke, cancer-causing agents,
 9          addiction, and actually contributed, as I said,
10          to many of the Surgeon General reports by
11          either writing portions of it or editing.
12                And he says, when asked:  Do you know
13          approximately when Chris returned to this
14          country and began smoking the Marlboros
15          predominantly, if not exclusively?
16                And he's right, the undisputed evidence,
17          since 1973, '74, folks were living in New York,
18          he says:  Chris Hatziyannakis died of lung
19          cancer because he was addicted to the nicotine
20          in Marlboro cigarettes.  Absent that addiction,
21          absent that addiction, he never would have
22          continued the repetitive exposure to all those
23          cancer-causing substances that ultimately
24          resulted in his cancer.
25                Question:  Is there any question in your

 1          mind that Chris was addicted to Philip Morris'
 2          cigarettes, the Marlboros that led directly to
 3          his death in 1994?
 4                None whatsoever.
 5                If Philip Morris had actually
 6          manufactured a cigarette that it didn't add
 7          ammonia to, urea to, if it didn't create a
 8          free-base effect that hooked people like
 9          Chris -- for instance, if they had sold
10          cigarettes that didn't contain nicotine or much
11          less nicotine -- Chris wouldn't have been
12          addicted to their cigarettes; but they didn't
13          do that because they know why people smoke
14          cigarettes.  It's not for the flavor or the
15          taste, not really.  It's for the nicotine that
16          they manipulate in the cigarettes that they
17          sell the public, including Chris, and that's
18          why he was addicted to their cigarettes and
19          that's why he was hooked and that's exactly
20          what they wanted.
21                And now it's time for them to be held
22          responsible.  Because without you, they will
23          not accept responsibility of any kind.  Not
24          one percent, not one percent will they say,
25          yes, we have some responsibility, we accept

 1          that, we are willing to be held accountable.
 2                You jurors are the only people in this
 3          case that are able to hold this company, Philip
 4          Morris, accountable.
 5                Next exhibit, please.
 6                THE CLERK:  You're at 50 minutes,
 7          counsel.
 8                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Thank you.  We know that
 9          he smoked mostly Marlboros, it's undisputed.
10          They have admitted their cigarettes caused his
11          death.
12                Next exhibit, please.
13                And there he is, smoking their
14          cigarettes.  We gave them everything in the way
15          of documentation, photographs, that we had.  We
16          gave them the photographs that they never sent
17          to their expert.
18                The gentleman that they brought to this
19          courtroom, who's supposed to use the DSM-IV as
20          a guide to help him make a determination as to
21          whether Chris was addicted, never interviewed
22          or asked to interview the family or to look at
23          photographs --
24                MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
25          There's no legal basis for interviewing family.

 1                THE COURT:  Overruled.
 2                MR. JOHNSTONE:  He didn't ask at any time
 3          to interview the family as a psychiatrist.
 4                MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
 5                MR. JOHNSTONE:  He didn't ask --
 6                THE COURT:  Overruled.
 7                MR. JOHNSTONE:  He didn't ask for the
 8          photographs, and they didn't send them to him.
 9          Nor did they send him any of the internal
10          documents that we've been talking about for a
11          week.  That's the expert, the only person after
12          all these years, that Philip Morris has brought
13          in the courtroom.
14                Cross-examination by Mr. Reilly of
15          Dr. Burns.  So, when I finished, Mr. Reilly got
16          up and he began to ask questions.  That was
17          first his chance to examine the witness to make
18          sure that the jury had all the information that
19          he thought was important.
20                And this is what he asked:  If, in fact,
21          Mr. Hatziyannakis -- this is Mr. Reilly --
22          began smoking in Greece as a young adult, the
23          decision to begin smoking would have been
24          Mr. Hatziyannakis'; correct?
25                Answer:  I'm not sure why it would make a

 1          difference where he started smoking cigarettes.
 2                And what did Mr. Reilly say?  It probably
 3          doesn't.
 4                He's just putting a time frame on it.  It
 5          probably doesn't matter where he started
 6          smoking cigarettes.
 7                Now, think about that for a minute.  It
 8          doesn't matter.  Not in this case.  Not in the
 9          family's lawsuit that they've brought against
10          this company.  It doesn't matter where he
11          began.
12                They don't walk out of this courtroom
13          because he began to smoke outside the country.
14          That's not the issue you're being asked to
15          decide.
16                What did we learn?  Was he addicted to
17          cigarettes that contain nicotine, and, later,
18          was he addicted to Marlboros?  The overwhelming
19          evidence is yes.  It doesn't matter.
20                So, listen carefully when Mr. Reilly gets
21          up to address you in his summation.  And remind
22          yourselves mentally, he's talking about foreign
23          cigarettes, we're talking about issues that he,
24          himself, has admitted doesn't matter.  What
25          else is he going to talk about?

 1                They've already admitted that he died
 2          from smoking their cigarettes.  They already
 3          admitted that he was a resident of the State of
 4          Florida.  They've already admitted that
 5          cigarettes are addictive.  They've already
 6          admitted that the cigarettes that are addictive
 7          can cause lung cancer, like he had.
 8                What else are they going to talk about
 9          when they will not accept responsibility?
10          Things like whether he started smoking in
11          Greece, or whether he smoked earlier in life.
12          It probably doesn't matter, he said, and he's
13          right, it doesn't make the slightest difference
14          in this case.  So keep that in mind.
15                Next exhibit, please.
16                Now, Dr. Burns explained that people
17          smoked everywhere.  It was in the environment.
18          It was normal.  And we have this belief, as
19          human beings, that things that are normal can't
20          be very dangerous.
21                What happens is people then consider it
22          normal, it's normal to smoke.  And part of what
23          "normal" means is it can't be very dangerous
24          for you.  I mean, it might have a little bit of
25          risk, you know, maybe something's out there,

 1          but it can't be really bad for you because
 2          everyone does it.
 3                And especially when, as in this case, the
 4          tobacco company, Philip Morris, continued to
 5          bomb the public with misinformation and
 6          denials.
 7                Next exhibit.
 8                Psychological Crutch.  This is a memo,
 9          Philip Morris, way back in 1964.  At some
10          point, reflecting the same seriousness with
11          which we met the Report -- the Surgeon
12          General's report, '64 -- we must in the near
13          future provide some answers which will give
14          smokers a psychological crutch and a
15          self-rationale to continue smoking.
16                And they did.  They said you can quit any
17          time, nicotine isn't addictive, it's a choice.
18          You have free will.  You like the flavor,
19          everybody smokes.  We disagree it's dangerous,
20          it doesn't cause cancer.  You've heard that.
21          And that's not true, and they've known it since
22          1964, when I was living in Winter Haven as a
23          five-year-old.
24                Next exhibit.
25                MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.

 1                THE COURT:  Sustained.  Do not
 2          personalize again, sir.
 3                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Yes, Your Honor.
 4                Tobacco Institute, fraud and concealment.
 5          May 1st, 1972.  For nearly 20 years, this
 6          industry has employed a single strategy to
 7          defend itself on major fronts.  Internal
 8          documents from the Tobacco Institute directly
 9          aligned with Philip Morris.
10                Politics and public opinion.  While the
11          strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed
12          over the years, helping to win important
13          battles, it is only fair to say that it is not,
14          nor was it intended to be, a vehicle for
15          victory.
16                On the contrary, it has always been a
17          holding strategy, consisting of creating doubt
18          about the health charge, without denying it;
19          advocating the public's right to smoke, without
20          actually urging them to take up the practice,
21          1972.
22                Next document.  Chris didn't know about
23          nicotinic receptors.  I wanted you to
24          understand that it's not free will whether you
25          smoke addicting cigarettes like Marlboros.

 1          It's not just free will.
 2                The free will is eroded by the release of
 3          chemicals and the pickup in the lungs and brain
 4          of the nicotine that sends a cascade or shower
 5          of dopamines and other chemicals to the brain.
 6                And that's what hooks you, and that's
 7          what causes you to have terrible withdrawal
 8          symptoms and shakes and nervousness and upset,
 9          when you can't get your fix.  When you can't
10          get your drug delivery device, and get your
11          fix, your brain screams for nicotine.  That's
12          what this exhibit was about.  It's
13          physiological as well as psychological.
14                Next exhibit, please.  Broken Promises.
15          Philip Morris accepts an interest in people's
16          health.  Philip Morris will cooperate closely.
17          We find -- if we find any components of tobacco
18          smoke that we consider harmful, we will remove
19          them.  Way back in 1955.
20                We want to be the detective just as much
21          as the Surgeon General and the American Medical
22          Association, we'll cooperate in any way.
23                If we find any bad elements in tobacco,
24          we'll remove them.
25                It's not true.  It was a conspiracy by

 1          Philip Morris with the other tobacco companies
 2          in this country to spread misinformation for 50
 3          years.
 4                Next exhibit.
 5                Mr. Farone.  I think we've looked at
 6          this.  Maybe not.  Have we looked at this?  I
 7          think we did.  That was the testimony.
 8                Dr. Burns, control.  Philip Morris
 9          certainly controlled --
10                This is Dr. Burns on the stand, the
11          fellow that came in from the University of
12          California San Diego where he's still a
13          professor emeritus at the university.
14                Philip Morris certainly does control the
15          amount of nicotine in their product very
16          closely as part of the manufacturing process.
17          They do it with a variety of different
18          approaches, and they do it very carefully; and
19          then they test it to make sure they've done it.
20          So, they do control the amount of nicotine
21          present in cigarettes.
22                Philip Morris knew it had to control the
23          amount of nicotine to ensure that people would
24          continue to come back and buy their product.
25                Now, on the issue of Chris -- and he's

 1          worked with hundreds of addicted people --
 2          Chris felt, in a sense, angered at the
 3          cigarettes for controlling him.  That is what
 4          throwing them away and stomping on them or
 5          stepping on them means.
 6                If you're not addicted, you don't see
 7          cigarettes as controlling your life and
 8          something you need to attack by destroying
 9          them.
10                He knew that he was addicted.  He told
11          people like George that he was addicted.  He
12          even used -- and I can't pronounce it -- he
13          used a Greek phrase to describe his own
14          addiction.
15                And what did their expert say just
16          yesterday to one of you jurors' questions about
17          the following?  Do addicts come to you and try
18          to deny that they're addicted?  And
19          Dr. Dosovitz admitted, no, they actually tell
20          me they're addicted, they know better than
21          anyone.  They're actually very intelligent
22          about that and recognize that they are
23          addicted.
24                I don't remember which one of the jurors
25          asked the question, but that was the question

 1          and answer that came yesterday.
 2                Chris knew he was addicted.  He was so
 3          addicted, he thought of the cigarettes as some
 4          third-party entity, that he had to kill.  He
 5          threw them on the ground and jumped on them.
 6                If you're not addicted, you don't see
 7          cigarettes as controlling you.
 8                And at the bottom, often when somebody is
 9          addicted and quits and says to their family
10          they have quit, when they relapse back, they
11          often try to hide that because they're
12          embarrassed about the fact they can't control
13          their own behavior.
14                Their expert, Dosovitz, admitted on the
15          stand that he relapsed.  He relapsed.  He was
16          dependent on cigarettes.
17                Next exhibit.  This is important because
18          way back in '64, this gentleman, who was the
19          Philip Morris CEO at the time, said the
20          following:  Obviously, a filter --
21                If you look at the bottom sentence at the
22          top, obviously, a filter takes out certain tar
23          and nicotine.
24                And there was an illusion that Philip
25          Morris tried to give the public that if you

 1          smoked filtered cigarettes, tar and nicotine
 2          and other cancer-causing agents would be
 3          absorbed by the filter and they would be safer.
 4          That's what the testimony has been, and that's
 5          what that means.  That's the public remark.
 6                The private remark is the illusion of
 7          filtration is as important as the fact of
 8          filtration.
 9                It was an illusion.  It wasn't true.
10          Despina thought it was true.  She spoke
11          directly with her husband, and said, look, if
12          you're going to have to smoke, try to smoke
13          these cigarettes that are filtered; and he did,
14          both du Maurier in Canada, and Marlboros here.
15                And she told us he was under the
16          impression, by smoking those cigarettes, he
17          would please me, and that those filters would
18          protect him from additives and cancer-causing
19          agents.
20                Next exhibit.
21                And it wasn't true.  It's a lie.
22          Knowledge of Carcinogens.  Philip Morris has
23          said since '64, if there are bad elements
24          through our laboratories, we hope we may find
25          them; and if they're found, they will be

 1          removed.
 2                Well, that's preposterous because they
 3          had known three years earlier that by that time
 4          there were at least 20 known cancer-causing
 5          agents, and we need to go to the next exhibit.
 6                Okay.  Let's go to the next exhibit.
 7                1968, our basic position in the cigarette
 8          controversy is subject to the charge, and may
 9          be subject to a finding that we are making
10          false and misleading statements to promote the
11          sale of cigarettes.  They knew that back in
12          '68.  That it may come to light someday.  And
13          they still did it.
14                Next example.  Let's go to the next
15          example.
16              (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
17          taken down to the best of the reporter's
18          ability as follows:)
19               We asked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds,
20          Brown & Williamson and Lorrilard to appear on
21          this program.  None would.  They told us to
22          talk to the Tobacco Institute.  The Institute
23          said Anne Browder would speak for them.
24               The case is still open.  The jury has not
25          come in.

 1               It may not be harmful.  You're not
 2          convinced?
 3               It may be or it may not be.  We don't
 4          know.
 5                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Now, I could go on for
 6          another half an hour, but there isn't adequate
 7          time, and I need to save a little bit of time
 8          to speak to you later.
 9                And so I'm going to ask you to bear with
10          me for a couple of minutes as we go through the
11          verdict form, and I'm going to ask you to
12          follow along, as I show you what the family
13          recommends that you consider in this case, if
14          we could, please.
15                Can we turn this ELMO on, please?
16          Thanks.
17                This verdict form is, I believe,
18          identical or very, very similar to the one that
19          you're going to get.
20                Thank you.  Thank you very much.
21                We see that Judge Streitfeld, our judge,
22          is at the top of the verdict form.  We, the
23          jury, return the following verdict.
24                One of you will be chosen to serve as the
25          foreperson, and will announce your verdict in

 1          open court when you've reached the conclusion
 2          or the decisions that you've all decided on.
 3                Was Chris addicted to cigarettes
 4          containing nicotine, to any degree was he
 5          dependent on cigarettes?
 6                Of course he was.  That's been the
 7          overwhelming evidence.  They called no
 8          witnesses, other than Dosovitz, to tell you he
 9          was not.  His testimony, I will suggest to you,
10          was not credible.
11                Next question:  Was Chris Hatziyannakis
12          addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine
13          manufactured by Philip Morris USA; and, if so,
14          was such addiction a legal cause of his injury,
15          his death?  The overwhelming evidence is of
16          course that it was.
17                Now, this is important, please.  One of
18          the instructions that you're going to get, the
19          law in the case, on both of these issues will
20          read, essentially, as follows:  In order to be
21          regarded as a legal cause of death, addiction
22          need not be the only cause.  Addiction may be a
23          legal cause of death even though it operated in
24          combination with some natural cause or some
25          other cause, if such other cause occurs at the

 1          same time.
 2                Now, this is what this means:  These
 3          folks are going to get up and say, the sole
 4          cause of his death was his own decision.  And
 5          we know that's not true.  We know that there
 6          are two responsible parties in this case.  One
 7          is Chris, we've acknowledged that, and one is
 8          Philip Morris.
 9                And I want you to understand that you
10          have the evidence and you have the law to hold
11          both of these folks responsible, and I'm asking
12          you to do that based on the overwhelming
13          evidence in this case.
14                If you look at the next page that you
15          folks are going to get, please state whether
16          the negligence -- forgive me -- please state
17          whether the negligence of Philip Morris USA --
18          let me get my glasses -- was a legal cause of
19          Chris' death.  The answer is yes.
20                And I went through these with you a
21          little earlier; and I'm asking, as you go
22          through the evidence in the case, that you hold
23          Philip Morris responsible in this case for each
24          of the claims that have been made by the
25          family, both Jim and his wife, Despina.

 1                And you'll see as you go through them
 2          there are a number of separate claims, and
 3          whether he relied to his detriment on
 4          misstatements that we've been talking about ad
 5          nauseam for days.
 6                Again, if you get to the bottom, as I
 7          believe the evidence suggests you will, if you
 8          look at Number 8:  Was there gross negligence
 9          by Philip Morris; and, if so, was that gross
10          negligence a legal cause.  Was it "a," not the
11          only legal cause, was it a legal cause.
12                Please don't be confused by that.  There
13          may be more than one reason for Chris' death.
14          His own behavior and decision-making, and the
15          acts and fraud and misrepresentation and
16          purposeful hiding of facts without any concern
17          for the consequences of their actions by Philip
18          Morris.  The answer is "yes."
19                Please state the percentage of any
20          responsibility for Chris' death that you charge
21          to Philip Morris.
22                Now, I have suggested to you based on
23          their superior knowledge, their information
24          going back to the 60's, that they hid from the
25          country, from their fellow Americans, and from

 1          this man when he moved to this country in the
 2          70's and lived here all through the time of his
 3          death in the 90's, that an appropriate
 4          distribution of responsibility in this case is
 5          Philip Morris 75 percent, and Chris
 6          Hatziyannakis, 25 percent.
 7                All of these decisions on the
 8          apportionment of fault, and the compensation to
 9          which the family is entitled in this case are
10          your decisions.  And you may exercise that
11          power as you deem appropriate based on the
12          facts and the law given to you by the Court.
13                What is the total amount of damages
14          sustained by Despina Hatziyannakis for the loss
15          of her husband's companionship and protection
16          and for pain and suffering as a result of her
17          husband's death?
18                And I suggest to you that you consider in
19          the past, for the 16 years that she's lived
20          without her husband, a figure of $10 million.
21          We know that she is healthy, and that she's
22          going to live, more likely than not, another
23          15, 20, 25 years.  And I ask you to consider
24          compensating her for the death of her husband
25          in the future with $10 million.

 1                This is a woman, after her husband's
 2          death, who continued to work and goes to
 3          Hollywood to this day to open and close her
 4          shop, and steps out into the dark alone at
 5          night, and goes home to her quiet home at
 6          eleven, 12:00 at night.  She has a picture of
 7          her husband at her bedside that she speaks to
 8          and prays to each night.  She continues to
 9          visit his grave.
10                She has told you that he was her life, he
11          is the father of her sons, and she never
12          considered remarrying.  She loves him dearly to
13          this day, and Philip Morris is responsible to
14          some significant degree for that man's gruesome
15          death.
16                THE CLERK:  You're at 70 minutes,
17          counsel.
18                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Thank you.
19                Because the eldest son, Harry, who you
20          heard from, was over the age of 25 at the time
21          of his father's death, the law in Florida does
22          not recognize his claim, and that's why
23          although you heard from Harry, and he is a son,
24          he doesn't have a legal claim in Florida
25          because that's what the legislature determined.

 1          Because Jim was 22 when his father died, he
 2          does have a claim in Florida that is
 3          recognized.
 4                Now, you know how much both of those boys
 5          loved their father, you heard from both of
 6          them.  I'm asking you to consider in this case
 7          Jim's claim for the loss of his father, his
 8          guidance and companionship, his father's
 9          inability to ever come to his wedding, meet his
10          wife, see what he does in life, give him help
11          and guidance, and speak to him as fathers and
12          sons do.  He's lost that all these years, and
13          will never have a father again.  He was taken
14          away from him in 1994.
15                And the figures that I've suggested to
16          you are $2.5 million in the past, and
17          $2.5 million in the future.
18                We already know, because the defendants,
19          Philip Morris, have already agreed that the
20          total amount of economic damages sustained by
21          Mrs. Hatziyannakis' husband's estate is
22          $114,609.
23                These decisions that you make are yours
24          alone, and we will respect your decision.
25                The last decision that you have to make

 1          today as you retire is the following:  Under
 2          the circumstances of this case, state whether
 3          you find by clear and convincing evidence that
 4          punitive damages are warranted against Philip
 5          Morris USA.
 6                The clear and convincing evidence in this
 7          case is that they lied and manipulated and
 8          disseminated misinformation and confused and
 9          created an environment all through the 60's,
10          70's, 80's, up and through the time of Chris'
11          death, that encouraged smokers to smoke, they
12          directed their message to those that are
13          addicted.
14                Their message wasn't focused on those
15          that don't smoke.  Their message was focused on
16          the most vulnerable, who were looking for a
17          psychological crutch and reassurance that
18          smoking was not addictive, it would not cause
19          death.  That was an outrageous lie.
20          Outrageous.  And I'm asking you to hold these
21          folks in this courtroom, in this case,
22          responsible.
23                We respect your decision and we thank
24          you.  And I'm going to have a couple of minutes
25          to speak to you when Mr. Reilly is through.

 1          I'll have a couple of remarks for you.  I've
 2          tried very hard to give you the information
 3          that you need to make an intelligent, just
 4          decision as jurors in the case.  I believe that
 5          we've been able to do that for the family.
 6          Thank you.


 4                MR. JOHNSTONE:  Okay.  I just have a few
 5          minutes that I'm going to speak with you before
 6          lunch.  I know everybody's hungry, you all have
 7          been here for the better part of two weeks.
 8                Please let me respond for a few minutes,
 9          and we will get the law and your jury verdict
10          form, and you can get to work on reaching a
11          fair and just verdict in the case.
12                The only personality that doesn't really
13          change is Mr. Reilly's.  He's a very nice guy,
14          and he's an able spokesperson for Philip
15          Morris, and he has attempted in his closing
16          statements to, essentially, change the focus
17          and to continue to defend the indefensible.
18          There have been some statements that he made
19          that I would like to address, if I may.
20                The family has accepted responsibility to
21          some extent for all the cigarettes that Chris
22          smoked.  It's not as though we're suggesting
23          that he's not responsible for cigarettes that
24          he smoked abroad.
25                I told you in opening statement that we

 1          provided evidence to the other side and
 2          photographs that he smoked certainly in
 3          Venezuela, and in Canada, and we know he smoked
 4          in the U.S.
 5                Now, Mrs. Hatziyannakis, when she took
 6          the stand, never indicated, never told you that
 7          he had never smoked at all outside of Greece,
 8          outside of Canada.
 9                What she said was that he became a
10          full-time smoker and started actually having a
11          pack of cigarettes in her pocket -- his pocket,
12          rather, he did, in Canada, when he started
13          smoking du Maurier.  That's the testimony, and
14          that's what we have been telling you since the
15          case began.
16                Now, let me focus on a few things that
17          were said about what changed, what's different.
18          There is no evidence whatsoever, although I
19          suppose if Mr. Reilly had chosen to, he could
20          have brought you evidence and spoken to you
21          folks about the advertising and about the
22          public statements that were made by foreign
23          tobacco companies.  He didn't do that.
24                What changed when Mr. Hatziyannakis
25          looked in the mirror in 1973, '74, '75, '76, up

 1          through 1979, and then all through the 80's and
 2          early 90's, is that Philip Morris, in this
 3          case, purposefully targeted, with advertising,
 4          people like Mr. Hatziyannakis, who were the
 5          most vulnerable to that advertising.
 6                We know why he started smoking Marlboros.
 7          We know that he was addicted to cigarettes
 8          before he came to the country, and we know he
 9          was addicted to Marlboros throughout his entire
10          life here in this country for the last 20 years
11          of his life.
12                Now, there were remarks made by
13          Mr. Reilly about nicotine patches, professional
14          help.  There's been no evidence or testimony
15          that nicotine patches were even available in
16          the last years of this man's life.  What
17          testimony was there?
18                Professional help?  This is a fellow that
19          never went to the doctor.  He had been
20          perfectly healthy up until the time that he got
21          sick with his lung cancer and the hacking and
22          the blood in his sputum started to cause him
23          problems and sent him to the doctor.
24                We accept full responsibility for his
25          attempts and his failures to quit smoking.

 1          We've heard that he tried to quit as many as
 2          ten times.
 3                You folks know in your hearts that he was
 4          addicted to cigarettes, that's the first
 5          question; and you know that he was addicted to
 6          Marlboros.  He smoked them for the last 14
 7          years of his life, almost exclusively.  The
 8          jury verdict form, the first two questions that
 9          you answer, are those first two questions.
10                And it's critical that you understand
11          that Dr. Burns, a foremost expert in the
12          country on this topic, made it crystal clear
13          that he was addicted to cigarettes and to
14          Marlboros.
15                The fellow that they brought from
16          Washington, D.C., Mr. -- or Dr. Dosovitz, used
17          for his diagnosis and his opinion that this man
18          was not addicted, the DSM.  That diagnosis can
19          be made using the DSM, if you obtain a detailed
20          history from the individual, or if you
21          interview the family and speak to them.  He
22          never did any of that.
23                When they put him on the stand to say
24          that he wasn't addicted to cigarettes and
25          wasn't addicted to Marlboros, he never even

 1          went through the criteria with you.  They
 2          talked about one or two of them and stopped
 3          dead.
 4                I went through all seven criteria that
 5          they used for addiction to Marlboro cigarettes,
 6          and Mr. Hatziyannakis met every single one of
 7          those criteria.
 8                They never told you, for instance, when
 9          he tried to suggest that Chris wasn't addicted
10          to cigarettes, or to Marlboros, they never
11          discussed with you the following:  The most
12          common signs of nicotine dependence are tobacco
13          odor, cough, stains on the finger -- fingers,
14          all of which he had, and you know, from the
15          evidence, is undisputed.
16                This fellow was addicted to both
17          cigarettes and Marlboros, and I'm asking that
18          you do your duty and go through the remainder
19          of the jury verdict form and get to the other
20          issues.
21                Let's put up a couple of exhibits for
22          just a couple of minutes, please.  Put up, if
23          you would, CL22, please.
24                Now, Mr. Reilly started talking to you
25          fairly early in his closing remarks about the

 1          issues in the case according to Philip Morris.
 2                Control:  Philip Morris controlled and
 3          manipulated the levels of nicotine in Marlboro
 4          cigarettes to make them particularly addictive
 5          for this man.
 6                We know that he struggled for many years
 7          to try and quit, he was ashamed of his smoking,
 8          it caused tremendous upset in his family; and
 9          because of the way in which these cigarettes,
10          with the level of nicotine in them, affected
11          his brain and his willpower, he was unable to
12          control his smoking and able to quit.
13                Philip Morris controlled and manipulated
14          the levels of nicotine in Marlboro cigarettes.
15          On causation, Philip Morris admits, in this
16          case, that their Marlboro cigarettes were a
17          cause of Chris' death.
18                So, on the first couple of questions, was
19          he addicted, that's crystal clear.  You guys
20          know he was addicted.
21                And then in an attempt to divert your
22          attention, perhaps, from the next easy issue,
23          was he addicted to Marlboros, and did that
24          addiction cause his death, as Dr. Burns told
25          you, he tries to suggest that it's complicated

 1          or difficult to understand.
 2                They stipulated in the case, admitted --
 3                Please put up CL35.
 4                They have admitted in Number 4 that
 5          Marlboro cigarettes manufactured by their
 6          company, sold in the U.S. to Chris, were a
 7          contributing cause of Chris' lung cancer.
 8                So, you have the addiction, you have the
 9          medical cause, and you have the legal cause.
10          There's no debate about it, there's no
11          question; and if you permit Dr. Dosovitz to
12          come in and suggest to you that he was not
13          addicted, it will be a terrible miscarriage of
14          justice.
15                The overwhelming evidence that you know
16          in your hearts to be true, is that he was
17          addicted to cigarettes, and to their cigarettes
18          in particular.
19                Dr. Burns -- CL8 -- is there any question
20          in your mind that Chris was addicted to Philip
21          Morris cigarettes that led directly to his
22          death in 1994?  None whatsoever.  That is the
23          legal cause.
24                Take a look at CL11, please.  Mr. Reilly
25          put a lot of testimony, a lot of exhibits up to

 1          recount what Dr. Burns had to say.  He put up
 2          very little about what his expert said, but he
 3          consistently wanted to draw your attention to
 4          Dr. Burns.
 5                And this is important, because whether he
 6          knew it or not, during his questioning of
 7          Dr. Burns, he conceded, through the questions
 8          and answers, the following:
 9                Question:  If Mr. Hatziyannakis began
10          smoking in Greece as a young adult, the
11          decision to begin smoking would have been
12          Mr. Hatziyannakis'; correct?  Answer:  I'm not
13          sure why it would make a difference where he
14          started.
15                And it doesn't in this case.  We are not
16          in this courtroom holding anyone responsible
17          for this man's death but the company that
18          marketed these cigarettes to him for going on
19          20 years, that he smoked two to three packs of
20          a day for the last several years of his life.
21                They have a legal responsibility to this
22          family that they have shirked for the last 16
23          years, and it's your -- most respectfully, your
24          duty to hold them responsible to some extent
25          today in this courtroom.

 1                Please put up CL39.  Now, we learned in
 2          the videotape deposition of one of their
 3          employees, the chemist that worked for many,
 4          many years with Philip Morris, that ultimately
 5          was fired by Philip Morris when he spoke out,
 6          we learned the following:  Philip Morris has a
 7          motto -- and we see the twin horses there,
 8          opposing one another -- and it's Veni, Vidi,
 9          Vici.  Philip Morris' motto is, I came, I saw,
10          I conquered.
11                Now, it's probable that that motto has to
12          do with its battle with other tobacco companies
13          that it was in competition with, but it's also
14          true of what these folks are trying to
15          accomplish in this courtroom in this case.
16                They expect you, essentially, to ignore
17          the last 20 years of this man's life, and all
18          of the misconduct and outrageous behavior of
19          their executives going back to the 1950's.
20                And I suggest to you that if you permit
21          them to do that in this case, then there will
22          not be justice for this family.  There will not
23          be a fair verdict reached if you let them leave
24          this courtroom without accepting any
25          responsibility whatever.

 1                This gentleman had a chance today to
 2          accept some responsibility for this man's
 3          death, and he accepted none.  He refuses to,
 4          and continues to stiff arm the family on any
 5          liability by Philip Morris.
 6                The reason that this company is
 7          responsible to this family -- put up CL24,
 8          please -- because they marketed and sold for,
 9          essentially, the entire time this man lived in
10          this country as an American citizen, their
11          cigarettes, knowing that they would hook him,
12          knowing that he may well get sick, and knowing
13          that he would die.  That's why they're
14          responsible.
15                Take a look, please, at CL36-1.  On
16          Christmas Day, this photograph was taken -- and
17          the actual photographs are in evidence, and you
18          can take a look for yourself -- the effects of
19          this cancer that ravaged this man's body, that
20          they admit they caused, they admitted that, not
21          voluntarily, but --
22                MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
23          That's not correct.
24                THE COURT:  Sustained.
25                MR. JOHNSTONE:  They admitted eventually

 1          in this case that the cigarettes they sold this
 2          man caused his lung cancer and caused his
 3          death; and if you go through the records,
 4          you'll see, among many other medical terms and
 5          descriptions of what happened to this man,
 6          you'll see that he experienced what's called
 7          temporal wasting, which means his head and the
 8          temple areas of his head actually began to cave
 9          in.
10                The cancer that they caused to some
11          extent in this man's lungs ate his brain from
12          the inside out, and he had seizures, and he
13          died on Dilantin, in seizures, unable to
14          breathe, because of the cigarettes they sold
15          him for the better part of 15 years.
16                Now, you have the opportunity when you go
17          to your jury verdict form and read the law, you
18          have the opportunity to hold both of the
19          parties in this case responsible.
20                You determine to what extent this
21          particular company is responsible after they've
22          admitted that they caused his death, and you
23          hold Chris responsible to the degree that you
24          believe he was.
25                And if you do that, and if you speak to

 1          one another and look at the evidence, you will
 2          have done your duty, and we respect that and we
 3          thank you for that.  Take care.
