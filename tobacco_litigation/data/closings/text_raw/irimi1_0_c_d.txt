18       MR. BOYCE:  Thank you, Your Honor.
19       Good morning.
20       JURORS:  Good morning.
21       MR. BOYCE:  May it please the Court.
22 Counsel.
23       Ladies and gentlemen, I want to start by
24 thanking you for your time and your patience
25 and, most importantly, your attention in this
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 case.  You've been a remarkably professional
2 and attentive jury, and that's one thing
3 everybody here agrees on.
4       So before I get started with my review of
5 the evidence, I want to make sure that you
6 understand on behalf of myself, Miss Amadi, and
7 Mr. Harrison, we appreciate your willingness to
8 serve in this case.
9       What I want to do today is go through the
10 evidence.  And as you may recall in opening
11 statements, I used this board that I entitled
12 Four Key Issues.
13       Sorry, can you see it down there?
14       THE COURT:  Do you want the easel,
15 Counsel?
16       MR. BOYCE:  No, I'll be okay.  I want to
17 use it for a second.
18       I want to use this as a roadmap to help
19 us go through the evidence, try to point out
20 the evidence that I think will help you decide
21 the questions that you have to decide now that
22 we have a verdict form.
23       But I want to spend a moment at the
24 outset to remind you as we talked about in
25 opening statements, there are really four key
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 issues.
2       The first thing we'll talk about is
3 evidence in this case that shows Mr. Moyer is
4 not a member of the Engle class.
5       The second issue is the evidence that
6 proves that Mr. Moyer at age 83 passed away
7 from skin cancer unrelated to smoking 13 years
8 after he decided to stop smoking.
9       The third main topic is the evidence that
10 prevents plaintiffs from ever being able to
11 close that drawbridge that we talked about; the
12 evidence that prevents plaintiff from being
13 able to connect any of the stuff that
14 Mr. Schlesinger spent so much time talking
15 about yesterday to Mr. Moyer in a direct,
16 continuous and substantial way.
17       And lastly, we'll talk about the evidence
18 you saw that shows that Mr. Moyer is 100
19 percent responsible for the consequences of his
20 smoking-related decisions.
21       In my opening statements, I tried to make
22 it clear that this case was about Dale Moyer
23 and Dale Moyer alone.
24       It's not about tobacco.  It's not about
25 whether cigarettes should be banned.  It's not
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1 about cigarette advertising.  It's not about
2 other smokers and what may or may not have
3 happened to them.
4       It's a case exclusively about Mr. Moyer,
5 the reasons he smoked, and what happened in his
6 life.
7       And the verdict form, as you'll see when
8 we go through it, each and every question on
9 that verdict form is about Mr. Moyer.
10       There's one question at the end, punitive
11 damages, and that's where Mr. Schlesinger would
12 have you start.
13       But there's a whole host of questions
14 before then, and each and every one of them
15 relates exclusively to Mr. Moyer and the
16 decisions he made about smoking throughout his
17 life.
18       What we saw from the evidence time and
19 time again, as we talked about in opening
20 statements, is that Mr. Moyer was a smart,
21 willing and informed smoker.
22       From the time he very first started
23 smoking at age nine, he knew to hide it from
24 his parents, he knew to hide it from his
25 father's congregation.  He knew that it was
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        inappropriate and something that he shouldn't
2        be doing.
3              In the early '50s, when he was in college
4        and in his early 20s, he starts to believe that
5        smoking is linked with a variety of health
6        problems.
7              And as we saw, by 1964, 1965, he believes
8        that smoking causes lung cancer, and that
9        belief never changes once for his entire life.
10              He never even heard of the agencies that
11        Mr. Schlesinger talked about yesterday.
12              Mr. Moyer never heard of TIRC or CTR or
13        TI, and we have the video clip for you.
14              Can you get it for me, Cliff?
15 16 17              follows:)
18        Q.    Have you ever heard of an entity called
19 Tobacco Industry Research Committee or TIRC?
20        A.    No.
21        Q.    Have you ever heard of an entity called
22 Council for Tobacco Research or CTR?
23        A.    No.
24        Q.    Have you ever heard of an entity called
25 Tobacco Institute or TI?
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        A.    No.
2              (Video clip concluded.)
3              MR. BOYCE:  He never even heard of the
4        organizations.  Mr. Moyer's beliefs about
5        smoking never changed based on anything the
6        tobacco companies ever said or did not say.
7              And when we go through the instructions,
8        you'll see how time and time again you're told
9        to focus on that connection.
10              Did plaintiffs prove a connection between
11        Mr. Moyer and the conduct?
12              And with all due respect, the
13        instructions are not mumbo jumbo.  They are
14        long, and it's a complicated case, but that's
15        the law that you have to follow here.  It's the
16        law of the case.
17              They are easy to understand if you take
18        your time and go through them.  But they're not
19        mumbo jumbo.  They are very important, because
20        they're the law that you have to apply to the
21        facts.
22              Secondly, we asked Mr. Moyer if he had
23        ever even spoke to an employee of a tobacco
24        company.
25              And you can see at the bottom that she
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        said: You've never spoken to any agent or
2        employee of any of the other co-defendants in
3        this case.  And he said no.
4              He never spoke to anybody at Reynolds, he
5        never heard of TI, he never heard of CTR, he
6        never heard of the TIRC.
7              We saw also from the facts that the first
8        time in his life that Mr. Moyer put in a
9        concerted and continuous and serious effort to
10        stop smoking, he did.  And never smoked again.
11        He was in control of his smoking.
12              The first time he went more than a day or
13        so without smoking, he stopped smoking
14        permanently and never started again.
15              And we saw time and time again how
16        Mr. Moyer was a willing smoker, smoked because
17        he liked it and enjoyed it.  Smoked because he
18        wanted to.
19              He was the one that led the jokes and
20        wrote the cheers.  Mr. Hammer described him as
21        a ball of fire at the party.  That's who he
22        was.
23              He was a man who enjoyed smoking, he was
24        a man who enjoyed having fun, restaurants,
25        vacations every summer, and as Mr. Hammer put
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        it, he's the ball of fire at the party.
2              But most importantly, he was a ball of
3        fire who passed away at 83 from skin cancer;
4        not from smoking.  And when he passed away at
5        83, it was 13 years after he stopped smoking.
6        And he stopped smoking by following through on
7        a program that lasted one week.
8              There was another piece of evidence in
9        here that I think was very important, and it
10        showed just how willing and happy Mr. Moyer was
11        with his smoking behavior.  And that's the
12        story that Ms. Rodd told us about the visits to
13        the R.J. Reynolds tobacco plant sometime in the
14        mid '70s.
15              In the mid 1970s, Mr. Moyer is in his mid
16        50s, and he decides to take his family on a
17        tour of a tobacco plant.  That evidence shows
18        that Mr. Moyer was not a smoker tortured by an
19        inability to quit smoking.  Somebody smoking
20        against his will because he couldn't stop.
21              It shows that it's somebody who is very
22        comfortable with his smoking, very comfortable
23        with the smoking decisions he made.
24              You heard her describe it as important to
25        him.  It was a big deal.  He wanted to go and
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        look at how cigarettes were made.  But it shows
2        his attitude about smoking as of that time.
3              An alcoholic trying to stop would not
4        tour a Jack Daniels factory.
5              MR. HAMMER:  Objection.
6              THE COURT:  Overruled.  This is argument.
7              Ladies and gentlemen, this is just
8        counsel's take on the facts in evidence.
9              Proceed.
10              MR. BOYCE:  It underscores that for the
11        vast majority of his life, as he put it, when
12        it hit the fan, he was happy smoking, in
13        control of his own behavior and smoking because
14        he wanted to.
15              And those are the two fundamental reasons
16        why Mr. Moyer is not a member of the Engle
17        class.  He knew everything he needed to know
18        about smoking from a very early age, he was in
19        control of his smoking and smoking willingly
20        because he wanted to.
21              The only legal cause, a direct and
22        continuous and substantial cause of his
23        smoking, was Mr. Moyer.  That's why he's not an
24        Engle class member.
25              There are Engle class members.  There are
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        people that maybe heard of TI or CTR, or CTR or
2        TIRC?
3              MR. HAMMER:  Objection.
4              THE COURT:  Sustained.
5              MR. BOYCE:  People who have difficulty
6        stopping and are tortured over a long period of
7        time by an inability to put it down.  That was
8        not Mr. Moyer.
9              We also saw a variety of evidence that
10        when Mr. Moyer wanted to control his smoking,
11        he had no problem doing that.
12              We talked about his early jobs at the
13        department stores, the clothing stores.  We
14        talked about how in church and when he was at a
15        nonsmoking restaurant or a nonsmoking hotel, he
16        didn't smoke cigarettes.
17              He told you, and his brother echoed this,
18        that after he stopped working in the stores, he
19        became a traveling salesman.
20              One of the things he liked about being a
21        traveling salesman was that he set his own
22        schedule, that he was his own boss, and he was
23        in charge of his own day.  And Larry Moyer
24        explained to you that smoking was part of that
25        lifestyle.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              But what appealed to Mr. Moyer was being
2        in control.  He was always in control of every
3        aspect of his life.  It was life well led; it
4        was a long life; and it was one that at every
5        turn, Mr. Moyer did what he wanted to do on his
6        own terms.
7              I want to point out Brooks Brothers
8        quickly.  He started working at Brooks Brothers
9        in 1986.
10              In 1986, Mr. Moyer is about 57 years old.
11        56 or 57 years old.
12              Plaintiffs would have you believe that
13        he's 30 or 40 years into an addiction that is
14        controlling his own hands in a way he can't
15        stop.
16              But he decides to go and work at Brooks
17        Brothers.  We know there's no smoking at Brooks
18        Brothers.  There's no stepping outside every
19        ten minutes to have a cigarette.  He takes a
20        job where he knows he's not going to be able to
21        smoke for big portions of the day, and he does
22        it in the mid '80s.
23              We've heard time and time again in this
24        case if you can go a day, you can go a week.
25        If you can go a week, you can go a lifetime
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        without quitting -- without smoking.
2              On the other side of the coin, we saw
3        time and time again that Mr. Moyer enjoyed
4        smoking.  Picture after picture shows him
5        living a happy and full life of which smoking
6        was a part, not a life that was controlled by
7        and led by an addiction to cigarettes.
8              Here he is at the beach, with his golfing
9        friends, winning a box of balls with a friend,
10        singing at the piano table, singing with
11        Ms. Hedberg, in the barbershop quartet.
12              And importantly, it wasn't just
13        cigarettes.  You heard from his brother that he
14        smoked a pipe in the late '50s and '60s.
15              You heard from Ms. Hedberg he smoked a
16        pipe in the '80s.
17              It's not just cigarettes.  There are a
18        variety of smoking that appealed to Mr. Moyer.
19        But it wasn't just cigarettes.
20              You've heard the concept of legal cause
21        needs to be direct, continuous and substantial.
22        But another way to look at that is if you take
23        it out, if you take the cause away, would it
24        have made anything different?
25              And when you think about whether
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        addiction is the legal cause of Mr. Moyer's
2        smoking, remember the pipe smoking, remember
3        that he smoked other forms of tobacco, and that
4        it wasn't just cigarettes.
5              And remember the pictures that show him
6        time and time again enjoying himself in a
7        variety of settings, of which smoking was a
8        part.
9              Contrast that with the very limited
10        evidence that you saw that Mr. Moyer ever
11        missed out on any activities or spent time
12        alone because of his smoking.  Smoking did not
13        control Mr. Moyer.
14              Now, addiction doesn't change it.  Talk
15        about how Mr. Moyer is in control of his own
16        behavior, but addiction doesn't change it.
17        Plaintiffs want you to believe that addiction
18        takes away choice, that it takes away control.
19              But every single doctor in this case said
20        the opposite.  Dr. Seidman, Dr. Mascarenhas,
21        Dr. Proctor, Dr. Wolek, Dr. Civantos and
22        Dr. Policzer.  All agreed that every smoker can
23        quit.  They all have the ability to stop if
24        they're properly motivated.
25              Dr. Wolek, I thought, put it pretty good.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        The idea that Mr. Moyer was too addicted to
2        stop is right here from Dr. Wolek.
3              He says: Certainly Mr. Moyer would be a
4        good example of that.  He, at the end of his
5        addiction, was at three and a half packs a day,
6        according to his testimony, you know, up to
7        four packs a day and he was able to quit.  So
8        there's proof right there.
9              That's plaintiff's expert witness,
10        Dr. Wolek, telling you that Mr. Moyer himself
11        is proof that every smoker can quit when
12        they're properly motivated.
13              You saw this from the Surgeon General.
14        Studies suggesting that everyone can quit
15        smoking.  And smokers quit by the millions over
16        the years, between 1955 and 1965, almost 18
17        million people quit smoking.  They are smoking
18        the same cigarettes as Mr. Moyer.  Smoking
19        cigarettes in the same amount of Mr. Moyer.
20              Thirty million people quit between 1964
21        and 1979, and by 2014, there's 60 million
22        former smokers in this country.  That is the
23        largest change in any one health behavior in
24        this country's history.  Period.
25              There are not 60 million people who
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        didn't jog and now jog.  There are not 60
2        million people who have lost weight or stopped
3        drinking or stopped drinking coffee or anything
4        else.
5              This is by far the largest change in any
6        one health behavior in the history of this
7        nation.
8              There's nothing about the cigarette that
9        stops this.  Those people smoked the same
10        cigarettes as Mr. Moyer.  Mr. Moyer himself
11        quit smoking the same cigarettes he smoked from
12        sometime in the late 1970s.
13              A couple points about the cigarette, and
14        I'll get back to Mr. Moyer.
15              You heard that nicotine occurs naturally
16        in the tobacco plant.  Dr. Proctor explained
17        that the defendants do not add extra nicotine
18        to tobacco.  They process it, but they do not
19        add extra nicotine to tobacco.
20              Dr. Seidman told you pretty clearly
21        there's nothing magic about a cigarette; it has
22        no power other than what the smoker gives to
23        it.  But there's nothing magic in it.
24              Dr. Seidman explained that after two or
25        three days, all the nicotine is out of your
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        body after you stop, and in two or three days,
2        all the nicotine is gone.
3              In a couple weeks, the brain begins to
4        rewire itself.  The brain rewires itself within
5        a couple of weeks.
6              The idea that there's a permanent change
7        is just not supported by the evidence.
8              But most importantly for Mr. Moyer, none
9        of this mattered on day 8 in 2000.  He used
10        Zyban for seven days.  There's no nicotine in
11        Zyban.  Zyban is an antidepressant.  It's
12        called Wellbutrin.  And Wellbutrin was around
13        for a long time.  But it is not nicotine
14        replacement therapy.
15              That means the first day he went without
16        smoking, there is no nicotine in his body.  He
17        uses the Zyban for seven days.  On the eighth
18        day, none of this is in any way powerful enough
19        to make Mr. Moyer pick up a cigarette or make
20        Mr. Moyer want to smoke or make Mr. Moyer go
21        back to smoking, and he stays that way for the
22        last 13 years of his life.
23              There's no such thing as a subset of
24        hyper addicted smokers.  And we talked about
25        this with Dr. Proctor.

1              The National Cancer Institute wrote
2        Monograph 15.  This document is in evidence.
3        You can review it yourselves.
4              We have a quote from page 24.  As you
5        recall, I talked about it with Dr. Proctor, and
6        what they looked at was people that were still
7        smoking, and they tried to figure out are these
8        people still smoking more addicted than the
9        60 million that have put it down.  And they
10        found no.
11              They said there's little evidence to
12        suggest there's an increasing level of
13        addiction in the residual smoking population as
14        measured either by the number of cigarettes you
15        smoke each day, or how quickly you smoke when
16        you wake up.  No evidence.
17              When I asked Dr. Proctor about it, he
18        said: That's what the National Cancer Institute
19        set out to study.  They were looking at whether
20        there was a group of super addicted residual
21        smokers who will never give it up, and they
22        said they didn't find any support for that
23        hypothesis.
24              But Dr. Proctor went on.  I asked him:
25        You don't dispute that the fundamental
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        conclusion of Monograph 15 is that there's no
2        support for this hardening hypothesis?
3              And he said: Oh, for sure.  That's a
4        mythology.  There's no body of smokers who
5        absolutely can't quit.  That is why the level
6        is continuing to fall right through that
7        mythical layer.
8              And the level he's talking about is the
9        number of people who smoke in this country.
10        They set out to see if there was some way to
11        explain why people kept smoking.
12              And he said: Look, the level of people
13        who quit continues to fall right through it.
14        It's a myth, from plaintiff's own expert.  It's
15        a myth to suggest that there's a group of
16        smokers who are so addicted they can't stop.
17              And the same thing goes for Mr. Moyer.
18        Dr. Wolek told you he's proof of this.  The
19        National Cancer Institute and Monograph 15 and
20        Dr. Wolek are saying the same thing.
21              If you look at what it takes to stop
22        smoking, you see the same thing.  Dr. Seidman
23        described Mr. Moyer as an emotion-triggered
24        smoker.  His advice for those smokers is that
25        wanting a cigarette won't hurt you.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              There is a saying: Don't just do
2        something, sit there and let the feeling pass.
3        That's what he's up against if he tries to quit
4        smoking.
5              And that's why motivation is the key.
6        There's nothing in withdrawal that overwhelms a
7        smoker who is serious about stopping.
8              If you could switch me to the Elmo,
9        please.
10              TECHNICIAN:  Sure.
11              MR. BOYCE:  You can see it at the bottom
12        from Dr. Seidman's chart.  Without a cigarette,
13        Mr. Moyer was nervous, irritated, angry, edgy
14        and upset.
15              On day 8 when he stopped in 2000, he's
16        experiencing those feelings.  But since when
17        did those feelings become a legitimate reason
18        not to do something that you wanted to do?
19              If being irritated was an excuse for not
20        doing something you were committed to do, would
21        any of us have graduated high school or been
22        able to park in the garage --
23              MR. HAMMER:  Objection.  Golden Rule.
24              THE COURT:  Objection noted.  Overruled.
25              MR. BOYCE:  You wouldn't make it to work
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        if being irritated or a little upset was a
2        reason not to follow through.  Not to put in a
3        little continuous effort to stop smoking, none
4        of us would be here.
5              You can switch me back, please.  Thank
6        you.
7              Dr. Seidman also had Mr. Moyer as the
8        scared to quit smoker.  This is the smoker who
9        has no end of reasons and excuses to put off
10        smoking.  If you can quit for a day, you can
11        quit every day. But it's the smoker that says,
12        no, not today, I'm too busy, too stressed.
13        They have no end of excuses.
14              That's what plaintiff's own addiction
15        expert classified Mr. Moyer as.
16              Dr. Seidman went on to say that even if
17        hardcore smokers, if you just go a day, they
18        are surprised by how easy that first day of
19        nonsmoking really is.
20              Now, Dr. Mascarenhas I thought was a very
21        important witness in this case.  He's not just
22        Mr. Moyer's longest term treating physician.  I
23        think he knew him for more than 20 years.  He
24        also knew him personally.  He knows him
25        personally, he knows him professionally.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              He also is the only doctor in the whole
2        case who ever met Mr. Moyer when Mr. Moyer was
3        a smoker.  So he knows him personally and
4        professionally, but he's the only person in
5        this case, the only doctor, that knew Mr. Moyer
6        when he was a smoker.
7              And Dr. Mascarenhas said quite clearly:
8        Quitting smoking is a function of willpower.
9              Do you agree that Mr. Moyer, during any
10        period of smoking, that he could have quit?
11              I believe he could have quit if he had
12        been motivated.
13              He always had that capability to be
14        motivated?
15              Correct.  And it wasn't until 2000 that
16        he found the actual motivation and actually
17        quit.  That's Dr. Mascarenhas.
18              That's important, because the only
19        difference between 2000 when Mr. Moyer quit
20        permanently and all the other times that he
21        thought about quitting or threw cigarettes out
22        the window until he got to the next town,
23        that's not a quit attempt.
24              Throwing your cigarettes out the window
25        while you're driving down the road and buying a
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        pack in the next town is not a serious effort
2        to quit.  It's a passing thought at best.
3              But Dr. Mascarenhas says it quite
4        clearly.  He always had this ability, always
5        had this power.  Didn't choose to exercise it
6        until 2000.
7              Now, in 2000 Mr. Moyer was properly
8        motivated, and he told you why in his own
9        words.
10              I want to look at four key dates to see
11        why it's the defendants' position that
12        throughout Mr. Moyer's life until 2000 he's
13        smoking because he wants to, not because of an
14        addiction.
15              The first is 1964, '65.  This is when
16        Mr. Moyer starts to believe that smoking causes
17        lung cancer.  That's a belief that never
18        waivers.
19              What else does he need to know?  He
20        believes that it causes lung cancer, emphysema,
21        way back in the '60s.  The ingredients, stuff
22        that people find on the websites.  If you
23        understand that it causes lung cancer, that's
24        all you need to know.
25              There was no evidence of a motivated,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        serious, continuous effort to stop smoking in
2        1964.
3              In 1979, he turned 50 years old.  This is
4        when he gets separated from Mrs. Moyer, and in
5        1984 he retires.  You saw the photo where
6        Mrs. Moyer kept working until 1996, but
7        Mr. Moyer actually retired full time in 1984,
8        except for the job at Brooks Brothers for a
9        period there in 1986.
10              So he turns 50 years old.  At a time when
11        millions of Americans are making choices about
12        their health.  If they're interested in what is
13        going to happen to them at the end of their
14        lives, they're making different choices.
15              And Mr. Moyer separated from his wife and
16        spent the next 20 years, actually from about
17        1979 to 2003, golfing every day, traveling
18        internationally, traveling around the United
19        States, playing cards with his friends at the
20        club in the afternoon, going out to dinner each
21        night, and having a couple martinis.
22              Mrs. Hedberg described him as the Dean
23        Martin type, the drink in one hand and the
24        cigarettes in the other.
25              But for that period of time, 24 or 25
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        years, he's not trying to stop.  He's doing
2        what he wants to do.
3              It's not until he gets motivated that
4        anything changes.  Nothing changed in the
5        cigarettes, and don't forget there is no
6        nicotine in Zyban.  Zyban is not nicotine
7        replacement.
8              In 1985 is when the warning labels start
9        to say smoking causes cancer.  Mr. Moyer told
10        you he stopped reading it.  He believed the
11        warnings, and we'll get to that in a minute.
12        But he stopped reading them.
13              More importantly, 1985 is when his Uncle
14        Tommy passed away from emphysema.  Larry Moyer
15        told you how repeatedly he explained to
16        Mr. Moyer, this is what's going to happen to
17        you.
18              But you didn't see any evidence of a quit
19        attempt, something serious, motivated,
20        continuous, a couple days in a row connected in
21        any way to what happened with Uncle Tommy or
22        the warning labels in 1985.
23              1984 is when Dr. Mascarenhas tells him
24        you've got to quit smoking.  It's the first
25        time we see COPD in a medical record and
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        Dr. Mascarenhas tells him: You need to stop.
2              Dr. Civantos explained to you that these
3        dates are important.  Because '64, '79, '85, if
4        he stopped smoking then, we're not here.
5              But Dr. Civantos also said if he had
6        stopped in 1994, he had a pretty good chance of
7        avoiding the injury that the daughters are
8        suing for today.
9              But from 1994 to 2000, Mr. Moyer kept
10        smoking.  And there's no evidence that he ever
11        put in a continuous and sustained and serious
12        effort to stop for those six years.
13              We talked about the patch.  Look at the
14        medical records.  In these five boxes that
15        Mr. Schlesinger was pointing to yesterday, you
16        won't find one record, ever, where the reason
17        for the visit was smoking cessation assistance.
18              His cardiologist tells him to stop
19        smoking in 1994.  Never asked Mascarenhas for
20        help.  Never asks any doctor for help.  Not one
21        record where the reason for visit is patient is
22        here to quit smoking.
23              Never goes to a cessation clinic.  Never
24        sees a psychiatrist or psychologist.  Never
25        asks anyone for help.  Has friends who are
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        former smokers, doesn't reach out to them, hey,
2        how did you do it?  Do you have any tips?  Hey,
3        Doc, I'm struggling with this, can you give me
4        a hand?
5              We have two patch records from 1992.  One
6        is from February and it says 30 patches.  If
7        Mr. Moyer was serious, there would be another
8        one from March.
9              The next one is December 31st of 1992.
10        No evidence he ever filled that prescription.
11        In Mr. Moyer's own words, he used the patch one
12        time.
13              We were talking about the patch you said
14        you took.  Do you remember what time frame it
15        was?
16              He said: I think I tried it just once.
17              The reference to the patch is two years
18        later.  We have February of '92, December of
19        '92.  Two years later.  It says: Offer patches
20        ASAP.
21              No evidence that prescription was ever
22        filled, and certainly no evidence that from '92
23        at any point in time he put in a serious,
24        continuous effort to stop.
25              Same thing with the gum.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              How long did you use the gum?
2              He said: It tasted awful.  I didn't
3        finish what I bought.
4              Chews the gum one time.  Doesn't finish
5        what he buys.  But this period between '94 and
6        2000 is the one that I think underscores it.
7        The only difference between what happened in
8        the past and what happened in 2000 is
9        Mr. Moyer.
10              Because there's no evidence of that
11        continuous, sustained effort for a period of
12        six years after he's told quite clearly from
13        his long-time friend, long-time cardiologist,
14        you've got to put them down.  No follow-up for
15        help, no request for assistance.  In those six
16        years, all we have are two patch records, a
17        year apart, and then two years later on, the
18        patch.
19              When he finally quits, nobody knows.  His
20        daughters told you they didn't know that he
21        quit.
22              This is Dr. Civantos.  I read this
23        quickly.  He says: I think there was a
24        reasonable chance if he had stopped in '94, we
25        wouldn't be here today.  When you stop smoking,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        your body starts to heal itself immediately.
2        Your risk of getting diseases from smoking goes
3        down every day that you go without smoking, so
4        after a long enough period of time you're
5        basically down at the same level of somebody
6        who never smoked.  You may not decline as
7        quickly.  May take a longer period of time.
8        But if you quit smoking, the benefits start
9        immediately, and they get better every day you
10        go without cigarettes.
11              That's what Dr. Civantos is saying, and
12        you can see that in the Surgeon General report
13        for yourself if you want to review them.
14              We asked his daughters, what did he do to
15        quit in 2000.  Miss Irimi said: I was busy at
16        the time.  I had a one-year-old child.
17              Miss Rodd said: I wasn't there at that
18        time.
19              And Miss Mumtaz explained: I don't know
20        how long it took him to quit.  I don't know
21        what he used.
22              I asked her: Were you surprised when you
23        learned sometime later that he stopped?
24              And she said: I never really had a
25        thought about it.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              The significance of that testimony is
2        that it shows that Mr. Moyer was not fighting a
3        50-year battle against addiction and losing.
4              Think about it the other way.  Think if
5        you had a family member that was trying to
6        fight an addiction, and they finally beat.
7        That would be the talk of the family.
8              MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge, golden
9        rule.
10              THE COURT:  Thank you.  Overruled.
11              MR. BOYCE:  If you had an alcoholic in
12        your family and they drank against their will
13        for 50 years and they put down alcohol, that
14        would be all you would talk about.  That would
15        be everything.
16              MR. HAMMER:  Judge, again, objection,
17        golden rule violation.
18              THE COURT:  Thank you.
19              Why don't you come sidebar.
20              MR. BOYCE:  I'll move on, Your Honor.
21              THE COURT:  Thank you.
22              MR. BOYCE:  Thank you, sir.
23              One of the daughters mentioned that she
24        saw him with a patch on one time and never
25        mentioned it to him.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              In the '90s.  Sees him with a patch.
2        Doesn't even mention it.  Hey, Dad, what are
3        you doing?  Keep it up.  Way to go.  Nothing.
4              No conversations about the health risks
5        of smoking with their father, no conversations
6        about cessation from smoking with their father.
7              The only possible explanation for that is
8        outside this courtroom they accepted that
9        Mr. Moyer, and Mr. Moyer alone, was in control
10        of his smoking.
11              We've seen the clip before.  This is what
12        Mr. Moyer said he did.  He followed the
13        instructions.  He took the pills and quit.
14        Took about a week.  Never smoked after that.
15              And we asked him why.
16              You can fast-forward.  I don't want to
17        play the clip.  Thanks.  You can fast-forward
18        to the first medical chart, please.
19              When we asked Mr. Moyer why he quit in
20        2000 -- you're all familiar with the clip -- he
21        said that it hit the fan for him.  That was it.
22              Told him he had emphysema.  It was
23        different.  For the first time in his life, he
24        was motivated to stop.
25              He was on Zyban for one week, and after
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        that the only person standing between Mr. Moyer
2        and resuming smoking was Mr. Moyer.  That's the
3        only thing for 13 years, and he never smoked
4        another cigarette.  And you heard him say in
5        this case that he never wanted to.
6              If you can flip to the Elmo, please.
7              TECHNICIAN:  Push the button on the side,
8        the white button.
9              MR. BOYCE:  Thanks.
10              That's the evidence that shows that
11        addiction is not a direct and continuous
12        substantial cause of Mr. Moyer's smoke.  He
13        knows what he's doing.  He's doing it
14        willingly.  He's touring tobacco plants with
15        his family.
16              And no evidence of a continuous,
17        sustained effort to stop until 2000, and that's
18        when he stops.
19              And that's why whatever you want to call
20        his smoking -- Mr. Hammer is right, you can
21        call it addiction, you can call it habit, you
22        can call it behavior.  Whatever you want to
23        call Mr. Moyer's smoking, that's up to you
24        guys.
25              The second part of this question: And if
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        so, was addiction a legal cause of the COPD,
2        emphysema and heart disease?  Right?
3              First part is, was he addicted.  That's
4        entirely up to you.  Whatever definition you
5        want to apply.  He might need it, he might not.
6              What is really important for class
7        membership is the second part.  Was addiction a
8        legal cause?
9              To be a legal cause, it has to be direct,
10        continuous and substantial.  And here, because
11        Mr. Moyer knew what he was doing and smoked
12        willingly and didn't put in the continuous
13        effort to stop, the only direct and continuous
14        substantial cause of his smoking is himself.
15        And that's why he's not an Engle class member.
16              That's why your answer to this
17        question -- and I know I skipped ahead a little
18        bit -- has to be no.
19              Mr. Moyer is in control of his smoking,
20        not an addiction.  Regardless of what you call
21        it, even if you call it addiction, it's not a
22        direct continuous cause of Mr. Moyer's smoking.
23        There's only one of those in this case, and
24        it's Mr. Moyer.
25              Now I want to switch gears a little bit.

1              If you could flip it back over, please.
2              TECHNICIAN:  Sure.
3              MR. BOYCE:  You got it.
4              TECHNICIAN:  The first medical record?
5              MR. BOYCE:  Yes.
6 7 8              follows:)
9              VOICE:  What was it that --
10              (Video clip concluded.)
11              MR. BOYCE:  We'll start right there.
12              The actual first question -- you can go
13        ahead and put it up.
14              The actual first question on the verdict
15        form, and rather than switching back to the
16        Elmo, I'll read it for you.
17              Was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of
18        Mr. Moyer's heart disease.
19              There's two introductory questions on
20        there.  One about heart disease and one about
21        when Mr. Moyer got COPD.  If you answer those
22        questions no, the case is over.  You would come
23        back in, and the case would be over.
24              We talked about the timing of Mr. Moyer's
25        COPD, and you see the evidence on both sides.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        One thing that's important to consider as you
2        look at that question is that Mr. Moyer never
3        saw a lung doctor until 2003.
4              The first time he goes to see a
5        pulmonologist, the guys that treat lungs, is
6        2003.  And that's the first time he had the
7        formal test, the pulmonary function test, that
8        diagnosed his COPD and emphysema.
9              I don't want you to think that because
10        they're separate on the verdict form, there is
11        any difference.  Emphysema is a form of COPD.
12        They are listed separately.  But emphysema is a
13        form of COPD.
14              With respect to the heart disease, with
15        respect to whether it was a legal cause, the
16        answer has to be no.
17              We asked Dr. Mascarenhas.  As part of
18        your care and treatment of Mr. Moyer, did you
19        determine what caused his coronary artery
20        disease?
21              Dr. Mascarenhas said: Nobody can tell
22        you.  All I can tell you is he was a coronary
23        profile.
24              If you look at all of the things in his
25        coronary profile, looking at all of Mr. Moyer's
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        risk factors, he had multiple risk factors.
2              Dr. Mascarenhas said he had five out of
3        the seven.  Smoking is one of them.  Family
4        history, obesity, high cholesterol,
5        hypertension.  He's got five of the seven.
6              Alcohol is also a risk factor, and you've
7        seen the alcohol records in this case.
8              But we asked Dr. Mascarenhas, can you
9        look at those and say that one of these is a
10        legal cause, that one of these is more
11        likely --
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me, Your Honor,
13        I object.  That's not what it says.
14              THE COURT:  Thank you.
15              Ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on
16        your own recollection of the evidence.  The
17        testimony of Dr. Mascarenhas is on the screen
18        as well.
19              Proceed.
20              MR. BOYCE:  They asked him, could you
21        look at those risk factors and say that one was
22        more likely a cause than the others?
23              He said: No.
24              Asked him again: You said no?
25              And he said: That's correct.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              That's Dr. Mascarenhas telling you he's
2        got a list of risk factors, and I can't tell
3        you which one of these risk factors caused the
4        disease.
5              In that situation, that's a gentleman
6        that if you take smoking out of the picture is
7        going to get heart disease anyway.  That's
8        but-for causation.
9              If you take smoking out of the picture,
10        because of the other risk factors, he gets
11        heart disease anyway.  That should be an easy
12        "no" for you on the verdict form for heart
13        disease.  That's Mr. Moyer's own cardiologist
14        telling you that it's not a legal cause.
15              Dr. Mascarenhas says that, you know, his
16        heart never even gave him a problem.  Having it
17        written in the medical records doesn't mean
18        that it's manifested or that it's causing you
19        problems such that you could recover for it in
20        a court of law.
21              This is his cardiologist saying,
22        fortunately, his heart never gave him a
23        problem.
24              And we heard this from Mr. Moyer himself:
25        You've had heart problems?
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              Not really.
2              When you say not really, it lends me to
3        believe -- well, he had been told he had a
4        heart problem, but it never showed up as being
5        one.
6              That should be an easy no for you on the
7        first question there with respect to heart
8        disease.
9              I want to talk quickly about the lung
10        cancer.  Mr. Moyer was lucky when he went in
11        for his hip.  They found the mass in his lung
12        on a chest X-ray.  They found it in October of
13        2003.  He had surgery November 12, 2003.  Never
14        had another treatment for lung cancer after
15        November.
16              In fact, in 2008 he tells Dr. Alvarez
17        that he's not going to follow up any longer.
18        He won't do any diagnostic studies and will
19        accept whatever happens.
20              Mr. Moyer did have a variety of health
21        problems that were unrelated to smoking, but I
22        want to spend a couple minutes talking about
23        his lung condition.
24              And then we'll talk about the next
25        question on the verdict form, which is whether
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        he had parotid cancer, and if so, did the
2        parotid cancer cause his death or was it
3        smoking-related diseases that caused his death.
4              First, I want to talk a little bit about
5        Mr. Moyer's pulmonary condition.  First, let me
6        say he obviously had COPD and emphysema.  But
7        the one thing I think that is clear from the
8        record in this case is that he didn't die from
9        COPD or emphysema, and that he didn't suffer
10        debilitating symptoms from COPD or emphysema
11        every day from sometime in the '90s until 2013.
12              And the evidence there starts with
13        Mr. Moyer himself.
14              In 2003, he said:
15 16 17              follows:)
18        Q.    Do you think the hip surgery had more of
19 an impact on preventing you from playing golf or the
20 COPD?
21        A.    Oh, the hip surgery.  The COPD was not
22 really evident yet, as far as slowing me down.  I was
23 in great shape up till then, I thought.
24        Q.    Up until 2003?
25        A.    Yeah.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              (Video clip concluded.)
2              MR. BOYCE:  So that's Mr. Moyer himself
3        saying up until 2003, the COPD didn't slow him
4        down.
5              I also want to make a point there is no
6        evidence, no testimony in this case that
7        Mr. Moyer's smoking has anything to do with his
8        hip trouble.
9              You can see in the medical records his
10        hip gives out after a lifetime of golfing.
11        It's not related to smoking, not a
12        smoking-related disease.
13              But it continues.  The first time he sees
14        a pulmonologist is in '03.  The first time he
15        has a PFT is in '03.
16              You've seen this record from February of
17        2003 where he's still golfing without any
18        shortness of breath unless he's on a hilly
19        course.
20              Mr. Moyer was 74 years old in 2003.  He's
21        a 74-year-old man golfing, walking without any
22        shortness of breath unless he's on a hilly
23        course.
24              That's in 2003.  It continues.  You saw
25        the pictures.  That's Mr. Moyer in 2006 with
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        his daughters and Mrs. Moyer.  He's not wearing
2        oxygen.  He's out of the house, part of family
3        events, doing things he wants to do.
4              In 2008, Mr. Moyer was 79 years old.
5        That's his youngest grandson, who is seven or
6        eight years old -- excuse me, about six years
7        old in this photo.  I think he was born in
8        2002.
9              Again, Mr. Moyer, not on oxygen, part of
10        the family, living a life.  He's 79 years old
11        at that point.  That's eight years after he
12        stopped smoking.  And the pictures tell you
13        what you need to know about this.
14              He also had other problems like his
15        weight and his sleep apnea.  Problems with his
16        spine that further exacerbated the breathing
17        problems that he did have.
18              When he gets to see Dr. Civantos in 2011,
19        he's not on oxygen, and Dr. Civantos's first
20        thought is that his lung condition may not be
21        as severe as we were worried.
22              But you think golfing in 2003, no oxygen
23        in '06, no oxygen in '08, doesn't wear the
24        oxygen at least all the time because he didn't
25        take it with him to see Dr. Civantos.  And
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        that's June of 2011.  June of 2011, he had just
2        turned 82 years old.
3              The reason he went to see Dr. Civantos is
4        he had the mass on his neck, and this is what
5        ultimately caused Mr. Moyer's death.  And it's
6        the only cause of Mr. Moyer's death.
7              Mr. Moyer had a mass on his neck.  He
8        went to see Dr. Civantos.  Dr. Civantos told
9        you that his first thought was it was squamous
10        cell carcinoma.
11              And here is a brief summary of the
12        history of all the squamous cell carcinomas
13        that Mr. Moyer had on his skin from 1999 to
14        2012, 13 years.  Squamous in '99, '01, '05,
15        '07, '09, and '11.  And there was a big one in
16        2008 on his left cheek.  And it spread.
17              This is what Dr. Civantos told you.  He
18        said that when he came in, he was worried about
19        the fact that what happened in his neck had
20        come from his cheek, and he wanted to get a
21        core biopsy.
22              But first we have a biopsy from what they
23        took out of his cheek in 2008.  This is what
24        Dr. Rosic was talking about.
25              These are the slides from what they took
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        out of Mr. Moyer's cheek in 2008, and these are
2        the slides that show that they did not get it
3        all.
4              That's a cancer cell.  You can see
5        Dr. Rosic, who is the only pathologist in the
6        whole case -- in fact, the only witness in the
7        entire case that doesn't agree that the
8        squamous cell carcinoma that he had here, here
9        and here and here over 12 years is not the same
10        cancer that he had behind his ear in 2011 is
11        Dr. Policzer, a guy who saw him four times in
12        2013, never looked at any pathology, looked at
13        one inch of medical records that he got from
14        Mr. Gdanski.
15              Dr. Policzer is the guy who sat in that
16        chair and said: People didn't know about
17        sunscreen until the '80s.
18              Mr. Harrison asked him: Where did you get
19        that?
20              He said:  I was guessing.
21              Just guessing.  Dr. Policzer is the only
22        doctor in this case who doesn't acknowledge
23        that what happened on his cheek spread to his
24        ear.
25              But that's the cancer cells in the 2008
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        cancer.  That's what Dr. Rosic explained is the
2        lymphatic system, the way cancer spreads, it
3        gets into your lymph system or your blood
4        vessels.
5              That's a cancer cell in Mr. Moyer's lymph
6        symptom in 2008.
7              These are cancer cells in Mr. Moyer's
8        bloodstream in 2008.  He was out and about.
9              That's where Dr. Civantos stands right on
10        this.
11              When Dr. Civantos sees him in 2011, he
12        said: I was suspicious because of the history
13        of this patient, and I wanted to know myself.
14        So I took a core biopsy.
15              The core biopsy is cutting the skin off
16        first, going in and getting a core.  Not just a
17        needle.  You want to make sure it doesn't come
18        from the skin.  Cut the skin off and go get a
19        core.
20              He said: Look, I want to make sure I know
21        what I'm dealing with.
22              When the report came back, Dr. Civantos
23        said it was spread out squamous cell carcinoma.
24              Dr. Arguelles, Mr. Moyer's cancer doctor
25        said: This is a periparotid metastatic tumor.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        Periparotid means it's around the parotid.
2              When we go back to the Elmo, I'll show
3        you what these questions are.
4               Periparotid means it's not in the
5        parotid, and it's around it.
6              And finally, Dr. Arguelles says: Judging
7        by the history of the large skin cancer
8        resected from the left cheek, this may well
9        represent a relapse of cancer, of which
10        Mr. Moyer is aware.
11              He told him this on the ground.
12              Only Policzer came in and second-guessed
13        any of this.  There's Policzer, the primary
14        parotid tumor.  The only guy in the whole case
15        that had that opinion.
16              Dr. Civantos puts it another way.
17              Mr. Moyer has squamous cell carcinoma.
18        Correct?
19              Started on his skin, correct, and
20        metastasized to his parotid?
21              Correct.
22              That's Dr. Civantos.
23              There is a question on the verdict form
24        that says -- maybe if you could switch me to
25        the Elmo.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              These are the questions on the verdict
2        form that relate to the parotid cancer.
3              The first is: Did Mr. Moyer have a
4        primary parotid cancer?  If you think that
5        Dr. Civantos and Dr. Arguelles and Dr. Rosic
6        are right and what happened was that the cancer
7        on his cheek spread and got into the area of
8        his parotid gland, your answer on this one has
9        to be no.
10              But what is important, if you answer no
11        for number 4, you skip number 5.
12              As you can see from the directions -- or
13        certainly you will be able to see from the
14        directions a little bit better in the jury
15        room, if your answer is no for Mr. Moyer on
16        primary parotid, then the cancer on his ear,
17        the cancer in his neck, the cancer that caused
18        his death is not related to smoking.
19              The only theory -- everybody acknowledges
20        smoking doesn't cause skin cancer.
21              The only theory linking smoking with the
22        cancer is Dr. Policzer saying, well, it started
23        in the parotid gland.
24               If it came from the skin, this one has
25        to be no.  But when you answer it no, which is
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        in, I think, all honesty, the only fair
2        interpretation of the evidence in this case,
3        that means it's not a smoking-related disease
4        and you skip question number 5.
5              Now, you can switch me back, please.
6              There's a couple reasons that we know
7        it's not primary parotid cancer.  The first is
8        Dr. Rosic took a look at his parotid.  That's
9        his parotid gland right there.  Those are
10        actually normal gland cells.  There is no
11        cancer in the parotid gland.
12              Dr. Policzer, who never looked at the
13        pathology, didn't know that.  There's no cancer
14        in the parotid gland.
15              That's why Arguelles is right.  There is
16        no cancer in the parotid.  It's behind his ear
17        and around the neck.
18              Finally, Dr. Rosic explained to you the
19        neck mass.  Those are the things called horn
20        pearls that are characteristics of skin cancer
21        spreading.  We have cancer getting in the
22        bloodstream in 2008.  We have the same cancer,
23        the same cell type coming back in 2011.
24              And when they look in his parotid to see
25        if there's anything, Policzer says there is no
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        cancer.
2              There is also no evidence that smoking
3        causes parotid cancer.  You can look through
4        these books, the Surgeon General reports, not
5        in there.  Not an Engle disease, but that's a
6        different matter.
7              The real reasons are, Civantos told you
8        this is a metastatic skin cancer.  Had nothing
9        to do with smoking, and these pathology slides
10        prove it.
11              That means that the only way that
12        plaintiffs can link smoking to Mr. Moyer's
13        death is to say, well, he could have had
14        surgery if he didn't have COPD.
15              We talked about his pulmonary condition,
16        we talked how Dr. Civantos when he first saw
17        him thought he could have the surgery.  We know
18        the surgery didn't go forward.
19              One of the problems here is they can't
20        connect COPD to Mr. Moyer's death in a direct
21        and continuous and substantial way because
22        there's no guarantee with the surgery.
23              Dr. Policzer even said it: We don't know
24        what would have happened if he had undergone
25        the surgery.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              I want you to remember this wasn't
2        surgery or radiation.  Dr. Civantos's original
3        plan was surgery followed by radiation.  But
4        this surgery was far from a magic bullet.  Far
5        from a cure.
6              He told you it was six to eight hours.
7        He had to flip the ear up and work around the
8        bony structure.  The nerve was going to be
9        sacrificed.  The paralysis was never going
10        away.
11              All of these problems were not related to
12        smoking.  That's what happened.  Skin cancer is
13        a nasty disease.  Cancer is tough on any
14        patient, regardless of whether they have COPD
15        or not.
16              But this six- to eight-hour surgery where
17        the ear gets flipped up and muscle gets
18        reworked and all the bony structures, it's a
19        very tough surgery at any age.  And don't
20        forget, Mr. Moyer is 82 years old at this time.
21              Dr. Civantos said the surgery would have
22        given him a fighting chance, and it was 60
23        percent shot at success.  Not 60 to 70, not 70.
24        He begrudgingly said 60.  It's an either-or
25        proposition.  He has a fighting chance if he
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        does both.  It's not just surgery.
2              The idea that there was a quick fix
3        surgery that COPD stopped is just not supported
4        by the evidence.
5              We also know what happens.  Dr. Civantos
6        reports there's a rare possibility Mr. Moyer
7        could end up on a ventilator after the surgery.
8        And in his addendum, he indicates that
9        Mr. Moyer was scared of that.  He didn't want
10        to take a risk of surgery.  And he didn't want
11        to end up on the ventilator.
12              And that the family, after consulting
13        with Dr. Alvarez, made a plan to proceed with
14        radiation outside the University of Miami.
15              He goes and starts the radiation.  So
16        he's scared to go on a ventilator.  He goes and
17        has it.  But you have to understand that the
18        surgery was at best a fighting chance
19        proposition.
20              His age, his other health problems, the
21        fact that this was metastatic cancer that had
22        been coming back since 1999, all that stuff
23        plays into his decision.
24              He decides to go with radiotherapy, and
25        the doctors tell him, this is a good choice.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              This is where Dr. Policzer told you: I
2        know what doctors mean when you say try and
3        eradicate, you don't mean eradicate.
4              Eradicate means eradicate.  You get to
5        decide for yourselves what is credible and what
6        is not.  This record says chemotherapy is a
7        good choice in trying to get rid of this
8        patient's cancer.
9              Dr. Policzer explained to you, though,
10        this type of radiation to the head and neck
11        certainly for an 82-year-old man is tough
12        treatment.  A nasty disease and tough treatment
13        for people that never smoked cigarettes ever.
14              Radiation on itself can make people walk
15        away from treatment, whether they have COPD or
16        not.  It's not the COPD that stops Mr. Moyer
17        from having the radiation.
18              Dr. Civantos said this pretty clearly.
19        We asked him.  Is it the COPD that stopped
20        Mr. Moyer from continuing with the radiation?
21              And he said: No.  I don't think I could
22        say it as strongly as that.
23              Reasonable degree of medical probability,
24        you're not getting that far?
25              And he said: I don't know.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              Dr. Civantos is telling you the COPD is
2        not a direct, continuous, substantial cause of
3        why Mr. Moyer had trouble with the radiation.
4        Surgery is a fighting chance, but it was always
5        going to be combined with radiation, and this
6        is Dr. Civantos telling you pretty clearly that
7        the COPD did not prevent him from continuing
8        the radiation.
9              He starts the radiation, he gets past the
10        worst of it.  I think he's past the nadir.  He
11        decides to discontinue the radiation.
12              And these are the letters where his
13        doctors at the time say: Look, you're past the
14        worst of it.  Please come back and finish your
15        treatment.  By not completing it, you might
16        compromise the final outcome.  We recommend you
17        resume as soon as possible.
18              He discontinued treatment in October of
19        2001.  This is Dr. Arguelles and Dr. Tache.
20              They say at the bottom: He tolerated the
21        treatments reasonably well with the expected
22        skin reaction and mild to moderate mucositis.
23        The parotid tumor did appear to be showing good
24        response at the time of the last exam.
25              So he tolerates it well.  It's working.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        It's shrinking the tumor.
2              Dr. Policzer says the cancer was
3        responding to the treatment.
4              Dr. Civantos says the tumor was
5        responding to the radiation treatment.
6        Dr. Civantos said: Look, if he was my patient,
7        I would have recommended that he complete the
8        radiation, and his chances of survival would
9        have been better if he completed the treatment.
10              Now, you know that Mr. Moyer didn't
11        complete the treatment, but you've seen that
12        COPD is not the legal cause of that.  He's 82
13        years old.  There is a variety of things going
14        on.
15              The plaintiff's own witnesses,
16        plaintiff's own doctors told you quite clearly
17        COPD is not the reason he couldn't complete the
18        radiation.  He can't complete the radiation,
19        which is part of Civantos's original plan to
20        give him a fighting chance, and they can't link
21        COPD or any smoking-related disease to the
22        cause of death.
23              The cause of death is skin cancer.  COPD
24        didn't stop anybody from saving Mr. Moyer's
25        life.  He was 82 years old.  It had spread and
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        come back half a dozen times.  It's a tough
2        disease.
3              Your answer on those questions: Did he
4        have a primary parotid?  Did the parotid cause
5        his death?  They have to be no.  It's not a
6        smoking-related disease.
7              And because they can't link COPD to his
8        death, your answer on whether the smoking
9        caused Mr. Moyer's death has to be "no" as
10        well.
11              Now, Dr. Policzer told you that after
12        Mr. Moyer stopped the radiation treatment is
13        the first time that he ends up in hospice.
14        It's the fall of 2011 when Mr. Moyer decides to
15        stop the radiation treatment, and you saw the
16        evidence after 2011, 2012, Mr. Moyer's living
17        by himself, got the roommate from -- the
18        snowbird roommate from Canada.  Excuse me.
19              He's got the snowbird roommate from
20        Canada, but he's living on his own.  He's
21        driving himself around town.  Cooking for
22        himself.  He's shopping for himself.  Paying
23        his own bills.
24              You saw him driving away in January of
25        2013, about six weeks before he passed away.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              But in 2011, 2012, Mr. Moyer is living by
2        himself.  It's not until April of 2012 that we
3        see the first hospice record.
4              But in April of 2012, he's getting home
5        care.  I think Ms. Irimi said they had a girl
6        taking care of him.  That woman's name was
7        Alicia Lord.  She spent time with Mr. Moyer
8        starting in April.
9              But Policzer said there was no reason for
10        Mr. Moyer to come to hospice without the
11        cancer.  Before Mr. Moyer had cancer, a cancer
12        not related to smoking.  Before Mr. Moyer had a
13        nonsmoking-related cancer, he was never being
14        recommended to hospice?
15              That is correct.
16              It's after he stops the radiation therapy
17        for the nonsmoking-related cancer that we start
18        seeing the hospice records?
19              Dr. Policzer says: Correct.
20              They start in April, but it's not until
21        the next year of 2013 that he is actually in
22        the facility.  So he gets admitted in the
23        hospice, and the primary diagnosis is end-stage
24        head and neck cancer, specifically parotid
25        gland cancer.  That's the skin cancer.  The
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        nonsmoking-related cancer.
2              The records continue.  These are
3        Dr. Policzer's own records.  He's got
4        metastatic cancer, metastatic cancer,
5        metastatic cancer, metastatic cancer,
6        metastatic cancer.  Always, every time in
7        hospice, the number one diagnosis is metastatic
8        cancer.
9              You can see that respiratory distress
10        shows up number three, number two, and then
11        it's off the chart all the time.
12              That's what I mean by direct and
13        continuous.  When you see respiratory distress
14        come and go, that's acute symptoms.  That's not
15        chronic.  That means he's having trouble
16        breathing this day, but not the next day.
17              Nothing on the 15th.  Number two on the
18        16th.  Number two on the 17th.  Nothing on the
19        20th.  Nothing on the 21st.
20              The one thing that stays constant
21        throughout his time in hospice is the cancer,
22        the nonsmoking-related cancer.
23              Disseminated cancer.  This record comes
24        from March 1st, which is six days before
25        Mr. Moyer passes away.  The primary diagnosis
United Reporting, Inc.

1        is still cancer of the head and neck.
2        End-stage head and neck carcinoma.
3              The patient is stable with shortness of
4        breath.  He's got the end-stage COPD.  Seems to
5        be comfortable with his breathing.
6              The number one diagnosis is always
7        metastatic cancer, unrelated to smoking.
8        Whether it's in hospice, whether it's from
9        Dr. Civantos, whether it's the medical record.
10        That's the direct, continuous and substantial
11        cause of Mr. Moyer's death, a metastatic skin
12        cancer.
13              He had COPD.  He died from skin cancer.
14              They can't connect any of the
15        smoking-related diseases to his death.  He had
16        COPD, but he died of skin cancer.
17              And that's where we come to the death
18        certificate.
19              Frankly, I don't know why we had such a
20        hullabaloo about the death certificate in this
21        case.  You guys get to decide why it was
22        important to Mr. Moyer's daughters that COPD be
23        on the death certificate.  That's a call for
24        you to make.
25              What's important is you're going to get
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        an instruction that says death certificates
2        don't decide the issue of what caused
3        somebody's death.
4              They show the date, the time, the age,
5        give you some other background information, but
6        in here, in this court, the death certificate
7        you'll read in the instructions, it does not
8        decide the issue.  You decide the issue.
9              And when you decide the issue, remember
10        Civantos.  Remember the skin cancer here and
11        Dr. Civantos telling you that's what this was,
12        the skin cancer got out.  I could have maybe
13        given him a fighting chance, but I can't tell
14        you that the COPD stopped him from having the
15        treatment that I would have given him.
16              That should be all you need to know about
17        the wrongful death issues in this case.
18              Now, your answer is no, we want to talk
19        about pain and suffering.  The wrongful death
20        damages, that's the reason that we ask.  I
21        think I asked it first and Mr. Batista, and I
22        think by the end Mr. Hammer was asking.
23              That's why the ages of the daughters are
24        important.  When you talk about a wrongful
25        death, one of the things you're supposed to
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        keep in mind is how long was the life.
2              Mr. Moyer got to see his daughters grow
3        into middle age.  He saw his grandkids grow to
4        be teenagers.  It was a full life, full of
5        vacations every summer, restaurants every
6        weekend, country clubs, new houses, new rugs,
7        new skates, new cars, fun and exciting things,
8        Heat games, Dolphins games.
9              It was a full life.  He lived to be 83
10        years old.  And when he died, he died of
11        metastatic skin cancer 13 years after he
12        decided to quit smoking cigarettes.
13              He's not an Engle class member, and
14        smoking did not cause his death.
15              Now, I want to switch gears a little bit.
16        There's four questions on the verdict form.
17              And thank you for your patience, I know
18        it's a lot of talking.  I have about a half
19        hour left, and then we'll hear from Ms. Ruiz
20        and Mr. Woods.
21              I want to switch gears and talk a little
22        bit about questions 8, 9, and 10 on the verdict
23        form.
24              I lost the sheet of paper here.  There it
25        is.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              If you would switch me to the Elmo,
2        please.
3              While I'm here, this is: Did Mr. Moyer
4        have primary parotid?  There's not even cancer
5        in that parotid gland.
6              When you talk about the legal cause for
7        number 12, were any of Mr. Moyer's
8        smoking-related diseases a legal cause of his
9        death?  That answer is no as well.  It's the
10        skin cancer, and the COPD did not stop it.
11              Question number 8.  There's four of
12        these.  They ask whether, as to each defendant,
13        Mr. Moyer reasonably relied to his detriment on
14        a statement or omission made by a defendant
15        after May 5 of 1982.
16              There's two of these questions that asked
17        if he relied on a statement from one of the
18        defendants, and then there's two of these
19        questions that ask whether he relied on a
20        statement as part of the conspiracy.
21              The date 1982 is important.  You have the
22        questions for before, but when you read the
23        instructions, it makes it perfectly clear that
24        the important issue here is whether plaintiffs
25        had proved Mr. Moyer relied on a statement
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        after 1982.
2              But the first thing -- and Keith, you can
3        switch me back over, please.
4              The first -- this is the jury instruction
5        on what reasonable reliance means.  May 5,
6        1982, will be in the instructions for you.  And
7        I'll get to it in a second.  I know it's just a
8        weird technical date.
9              But on these reliance questions, 1, 2, 3,
10        4, the real issue is whether plaintiffs have
11        showed you he relied on anything after May of
12        1982.
13              But in order to rely on something,
14        there's a very important limitation.
15              The jury instructions say quite clearly
16        that Mr. Moyer cannot be found to have relied
17        on a statement or omission if he knew it was
18        false or its falsity was obvious to him, or if
19        the fact allegedly concealed was already known
20        to him.
21              Put in simple terms, you can't hide
22        something from someone if they already know
23        it's true.
24              And that's the biggest reason your answer
25        for all of these reliance questions from
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        Mr. Moyer has to be "no."
2              Mr. Moyer knew everything he needed to
3        know about smoking, from at least the '50s, the
4        '50s and '60s.  Every single fact that they
5        talk about with TI and CTR and TIRC, the
6        organizations he never heard of, every single
7        one of those facts was known to him for decades
8        before they were even made.
9              He can't rely on something -- even if
10        that statement is not true, he can't rely on it
11        if he knows the truth.  And he did.
12              This is the drawbridge.  It's not a
13        castle.  It's the 17th Street Causeway.  We've
14        all been stuck there more times than we can
15        probably remember.
16              But that's the problem.  They can't
17        connect anything that went on with conspiracy
18        that Dr. Proctor talked about to Mr. Moyer.
19              The drawbridge stayed open through the
20        whole case.  It's not just the lack of him
21        seeing it or knowing about it or hearing about
22        it.  The fundamental reason is you can't
23        conceal something from someone if they already
24        know the truth.
25              Let's just go quickly through all the
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        stuff that Mr. Moyer learned about smoking in
2        his life.
3              These are the articles from Detroit in
4        the '50s, linking lung cancer to smoking.  They
5        are not just articles that we picked.  These
6        are from the newspapers that were in
7        Mr. Moyer's own home.
8              Witness after witness told you he was a
9        smart man, stayed up on current events, knew
10        what he was doing.
11              Reader's Digest in the '50s.  How harmful
12        are cigarettes.  Cancer by the carton.
13        Instructions on quitting.  It's not just
14        linking smoking with cancer, heart disease,
15        emphysema.  Going this far back.
16              When you look through the evidence,
17        you'll see that these articles have advice on
18        how to stop.
19              This is a magazine in Mr. Moyer's house
20        way back in the '50s.  You've seen this one
21        where in 1957 the Surgeon General said there
22        had been excellent coverage, and the head of
23        the National Cancer Institute indicated that
24        the media and the newspapers, radio had done a
25        terrific job covering this and informing the
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        public.
2              1964, the Surgeon General's report comes
3        out.  Mr. Moyer remembered himself, remembered
4        the coverage, remembers Edward R. Murrow a year
5        later.
6              This is the cover from the Fort
7        Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.  Want to Quit Smoking?
8        Read on.  Men Who Know Best Cure Isn't Easy.
9        That's from the Fort Lauderdale papers.
10              This is Mr. Moyer talking about Edward R.
11        Murrow and the impression it made on him.
12 13 14              follows:)
15        Q.    Do you remember seeing anti-smoking
16 advertisements?
17        A.    Yeah, I remember several instances of
18 people who -- I remember specifically the Edward R.
19 Murrow, when he sat and talked about dying of lung
20 cancer.  I think it was after he was already dead.
21 There was a commercial that they had, that he was
22 telling you to quit, and it made a very big impression
23 on me.  So big that I quit about 30 years later.
24        Q.    Did you believe what he was saying?
25        A.    I believed it.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              (Video clip concluded.)
2              MR. BOYCE:  He believed it.  '64, 1965.
3        He believes that Edward R. Murrow died from
4        lung cancer from smoking.
5              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, may I approach,
6        please.
7              THE COURT:  Sure.
8              (The following discussion was held at
9              sidebar:)
10              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sounds to me like he
11        cut that man's answer off right in the middle
12        of the answer.  I'm not sure.  But I have a
13        feeling the man seemed like he was still
14        talking.  I don't think that was the man's full
15        answer.
16              THE COURT:  But I don't know what his
17        complete answer is.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Page and line and just
19        stopped.
20              THE COURT:  What is his full answer?
21              MR. HAMMER:  His full answer was: I
22        believe he had lung cancer.
23              THE COURT:  Let me see it.
24              MR. BOYCE:  Judge, on their
25        representation, I'll add it.  It doesn't
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        matter.
2              THE COURT:  Thank you.
3              (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
4              following was held in open court:)
5              MR. BOYCE:  The video clip got cut off a
6        little bit there.  The rest of his answer is
7        that, I believed Mr. Murrow had lung cancer.
8              And I think what he added was: He had no
9        reason to lie.
10              Believes Edward R. Murrow.  Believes the
11        PSA.  Believes that Edward R. Murrow gets
12        smoking (sic) from lung cancer.
13              And the last part of it is, he knows that
14        Murrow has no reason to lie.  Huge impression
15        on him.
16              Heard that from Seidman, heard that from
17        Larry Moyer, heard that from Mr. Moyer himself.
18        That Edward R. Murrow clip made a very, very
19        big impression on Mr. Moyer.  That's 1965.
20              Remember, there's no quit attempt
21        attached to that.  That's willing smoking.
22              That's why addiction is not a legal cause
23        of this man's behavior.  You hear about
24        something like that.  It makes an impression on
25        you.  You don't respond by trying to stop.  You
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        are responsible for it.  Addiction is not the
2        reason.
3              1966, the warning labels go on the pack.
4        Smoking may be hazardous to your help.
5        Congress has acted.  The next step is yours.
6              Mr. Moyer, we asked him: Did you believe
7        the warning?
8              I think I did, for the most part, you
9        know.  I would say yes.
10              Believes the warning back in 1966.  It's
11        on every pack of cigarettes afterwards.  On
12        every pack of Salem cigarettes he ever smoked.
13              You can skip this one.
14              1970 warning label, Surgeon General has
15        determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous
16        to your health.
17              Again, Mr. Moyer turns 40 in 1970.  And
18        again, no quit attempt connected to that one.
19              This is Uncle Tommy.  We talked about
20        this a little early on.  Again, no quit
21        attempts.
22              Larry Moyer is telling him this is going
23        to happen to you.  This is the disease that
24        Mr. Moyer ended up with, emphysema.  1985.
25        Uncle Tommy's condition went on for ten years,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        and it was general knowledge among the family.
2              No quit attempt attached to that.  That
3        kind of awareness prevents Mr. Moyer from
4        relying on anything that TI or CTR or TIRC
5        says.
6              Somebody takes you to see your uncle and
7        tells you he's got emphysema from smoking, and
8        this is going to happen to you, you cannot
9        conceal that fact as a matter of law from that
10        person anymore.
11              Lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease.
12        He knew everything he needed to know throughout
13        his smoking career.
14              The '85 warning labels, smoking causes
15        lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema.  Smoking
16        by pregnant women results in fetal injury and
17        premature birth.  Smoking contains carbon
18        monoxide.
19              And the same one that Dr. Civantos talked
20        about, the reason the four key dates of '64 and
21        '75 and '85 and '94 are so important: Quitting
22        smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to
23        your health.
24              Those go on in 1985.  And Mr. Moyer stops
25        reading them.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              This shows how he already knows what's
2        going on.  Nothing shows you know it more when
3        you stop reading them.
4              He believes them in '66.  By the time we
5        get to the '80s, I didn't read them.
6              You just stopped reading what was on the
7        package?
8              And he says: Right.
9              You can't conceal a fact from someone if
10        they already know it's the case.
11              I want to talk now fundamentally, that
12        reason applies to all defendants.  You will see
13        on the verdict form -- and if you could switch
14        me back over to the Elmo -- actually, never
15        mind, Keith.  Thank you.
16              When you go through the questions on
17        reliance, and these are 8, 9, 10, 11 on the
18        verdict form, you'll see that they list out
19        each defendant.
20              And because of what we just talked about
21        and the jury instruction, how you cannot
22        conceal something from someone that they
23        already know, your answer should be "no" for
24        each defendant for each one of those questions.
25              But in particular, this is where the date
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        of 1982 comes in.  And I want to talk about
2        Reynolds a little bit specifically.
3              Plaintiffs played the clip of Mr. Moyer
4        saying he thought Salem lights were a step in
5        the right direction.  They're going to suggest
6        to you in rebuttal that you should answer these
7        questions yes.
8              The first and fundamental reason is the
9        jury instruction.  You can't rely if you know
10        the truth.
11              But there is a second reason for it.
12        One, Mr. Moyer told you, in his own words, that
13        by the time he switched to Salem, he was aware
14        that smoking caused lung cancer.
15              I would have to say yes.
16              And were you also aware before you ever
17        smoked a Salem that it could cause breathing
18        difficulties?
19              Yes.
20              We asked him: Why did you go to menthol?
21              You can skip this one.
22              What did you like about Salem?
23              He said: I got to where I liked the taste
24        of menthol, rather than non-menthol, which was
25        not the case when I first started.  I always
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        liked menthol and wondered why they didn't make
2        ten-packs instead of twenty for people who
3        didn't want to smoke menthol all the time.
4              The last two I think are very important
5        when you consider Reynolds on the reliance
6        questions.
7              I would have wound up with menthol
8        anyway.  Mr. Moyer's own words.
9              Not necessarily with Salem?
10              No.
11              We asked him -- you can skip these
12        videos, thank you.
13              Do you remember why you picked Salem?
14              First he said: You know, I liked menthol.
15        I probably would have ended up with it anyway.
16        And it's possible -- says it's a distinct
17        possibility, down at the bottom, that he
18        started smoking Salems because Irma Becker was
19        smoking Salem, and he gradually began to smoke
20        some of hers.
21              He said: I can't honestly answer that, I
22        don't recall, but it's a distinct possibility.
23              He's not quite sure if it was Irma or his
24        like for menthol.  There's one thing that's
25        perfectly sure about it.  Reynolds
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        advertisements had nothing to do with it.
2              Can you say with any certainty that Salem
3        lights ads affected your decision to smoke
4        Salem lights?
5              No.
6              Clear as can be.  When you get to
7        reliance, remember when he knew, remember this
8        testimony.  No.
9              Can you say with any certainty that Salem
10        ads affected your decision to smoke Salems?
11              I can't say that the ads did.  No.
12              Remember what Mr. Moyer knows and
13        remember this testimony when you look at
14        Reynolds on that verdict form for those
15        reliance questions.
16              Lastly is the timing -- well, first, I
17        don't want anybody to think that Mr. Moyer
18        thought lights were safe.
19              We heard about Diet Coke and salad
20        dressing and low calories and that kind of
21        stuff.  Not clear where that came from from
22        Mr. Moyer.  Certainly didn't come from Reynolds
23        advertisements.  His testimony is unequivocal
24        on that point.
25              We said: You didn't think it was safe,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        did you?
2              He said: No.
3              You didn't think it was going to
4        eliminate your risk?
5              No.
6              And you didn't think it was completely --
7              Mr. Moyer steps in and says: No, I did
8        not.
9              Final point on the timing.  One thing we
10        know about in this case is that Mr. Moyer
11        switched to Salem and Salem lights before May
12        of 1982.
13              Miss Rodd took the stand and told you
14        that she remembered pretty clearly that she had
15        come home from college in her junior year.  She
16        started 1979, graduated in 1983.
17              She said she distinctly remembers coming
18        home sometime in her junior year, going to
19        lunch with her father and seeing him with Salem
20        lights.
21              If May of '82 is the end of her junior
22        year, he's obviously made the switch to Salem
23        well before May 5 of 1982.
24              If he's got Salem lights out with his
25        daughter sometime in the school year of 1982,
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        he's made that switch to Salem lights well
2        before May 5 of 1982.
3              You've got the reliance point for all the
4        defendants.  But the Reynolds on Salem, would
5        have ended up with menthol anyway.  There's a
6        good chance he got them from Miss Becker.
7              And lastly, we know, according to the
8        testimony of his own daughter, that for
9        whatever reason he switched to Salem lights
10        before May 5 of 1982.
11              Now, the good news is that gets us
12        through three of the key issues.
13              Thank you for your patience, and I've got
14        one more topic and I want to turn to that now.
15              This is where plaintiffs would have you
16        start.  It's with punitive damages.
17              Mr. Schlesinger said a couple times that
18        Dale Moyer is a conduit to punitive damages.
19        He's not a conduit.  He's not a fish either.
20        He's a person who lived 83 years, making his
21        own decisions on his own terms.  But he's not
22        just a conduit to punitive damages.
23              In this case, all of the damages -- well,
24        in this case we've been talking about the
25        compensatory issue.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              The punitive damages are different.
2        Punitive damages are above and beyond what you
3        may or may not award to Mr. Moyer's daughters
4        because of the smoking.  And all of the money
5        that you do or do not award would go to the
6        daughters --
7              MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.  It's not
8        an issue of money.  It's an issue of
9        entitlement to punitive damages.
10              THE COURT:  Thank you.
11              Objection noted.  Sustained.
12              MR. BOYCE:  Punitive damages are
13        different here.  They are different, and they
14        have a different purpose.  We're going to talk
15        about how in order to award punitive damages,
16        they have to connect something to Mr. Moyer.
17              But first, I want to tell you about the
18        burden of proof of punitive damages.
19              This is Dr. Proctor here -- and let me
20        just get to this point real quick.  All of the
21        stuff that Dr. Proctor talked about, he
22        admitted in this slide he couldn't connect to
23        Mr. Moyer.
24              He said right here: I didn't do anything
25        to prepare for this case.  I don't know
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        anything about his biography.
2              Do you know what newspapers he read?
3              No.
4              Is it really important to your opinion as
5        to how far the tobacco companies affected
6        people?
7              It's not relevant at all what his
8        particular life was for my expertise.
9              That's Dr. Proctor.  It's not relevant at
10        all what Mr. Moyer's life was.  No relevance at
11        all.
12              This, I think, is a good example of just
13        how wide the drawbridge is.  Plaintiffs talked
14        a lot about youth marketing.  You're going to
15        hear more about it in Mr. Schlesinger's
16        rebuttal.
17              This is the last time I get to talk to
18        you.  So I want to give you a couple things to
19        think about as you hear from Mr. Schlesinger in
20        rebuttal.
21              But this chart, more than any other one,
22        shows just how far removed the real life that
23        Mr. Moyer led is from Mr. Schlesinger's attack
24        on the tobacco industry.
25              Underneath the blue, it says: Defendants'
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        marketing practices at time Dale was a youth.
2              The first one is from 1927, just a year
3        and a half before Mr. Moyer was even born.
4              The second one is from 1928, which is
5        from a full year before Mr. Moyer is even born.
6              Dr. Proctor told you he had looked, and
7        that those were very rare documents.  He
8        searched for more, he couldn't find them.
9              But we've got two on the left from before
10        he's even born.  We've got one from 1973, when
11        Mr. Moyer was 44 years old, and one from 1984,
12        when Mr. Moyer is 55 years old.
13              He's 44 and 55 years old.
14              It's not about other smokers.  This is
15        the burden of proof.  It has to be evidence for
16        punitive damages that's precise and explicit,
17        lacking in confusion and produces a firm
18        belief.  It's a much higher burden.
19              We have preponderance of the evidence on
20        the other issues.  We have a much higher burden
21        for punitive damages, because they're
22        different.  They're different damages.
23              Here, the Judge is going to explain to
24        you perfectly clear, you cannot use the Engle
25        findings to decide whether punitive damages
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        should be awarded in this case.  You cannot use
2        harm to others.
3              And this is the objection I've made
4        throughout this case, and this is the
5        instruction as it's going to be in your
6        pamphlets: In deciding whether punitive damages
7        are warranted, you may not seek to punish a
8        defendant for any harms suffered by individuals
9        other than Mr. Moyer.
10              This is the drawbridge.  This is where
11        they have to connect something that Dr. Proctor
12        talked about, something from a document to
13        Mr. Moyer, and they just can't do it.
14              They never came close.
15              It's not just his knowledge; it's that
16        there's no connection.  So much of the stuff we
17        saw in this case, all of the Philip Morris
18        documents.  He never smoked a Philip Morris
19        brand.  All the TV shows he never saw, the
20        Flintstones, the Hillbillies.
21              Once it goes to Saturday morning,
22        Reynolds pulls the sponsorship.  Once the kids
23        start watching, they pull the sponsorship.
24        That's the stuff you hear on cross.
25              You don't hear that on direct.  You never
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        heard any direct connection.  Never heard of TI
2        and CTR, never heard of TIRC.  Never saw any of
3        the ads, all the Philip Morris ads and
4        statements, none of that stuff with any
5        connection with Mr. Moyer at all.
6              This case is not about other smokers,
7        it's only about Mr. Moyer.  And that's why here
8        on the facts of his life, punitive damages are
9        not warranted.
10              You also get to consider mitigating
11        evidence.
12              In determining whether punitive damages
13        are warranted, you can consider mitigating
14        evidence, which shows that there's no need to
15        do it.
16              I'll go through this quickly.
17              We talked about quite a bit of mitigating
18        evidence here.  Quite a bit.
19              With Dr. Proctor and his presentation
20        that he's given 50 times, that's
21        extraordinarily one-sided on direct.
22              You saw on cross, that I have to show the
23        other side of the coin, but you also saw how he
24        sees those documents coming.  He knows the
25        other side.  He's been through this drill 50
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        times and made more than $2 million.  He knows
2        the documents I'm going to show him before
3        time.  But he doesn't give them to you.
4              But this evidence you get to consider.
5              The first is all the publications from
6        CTR, Nobel Prize winners trying to figure out
7        what causes cancer, 7,000 articles published,
8        600 of them cited in the Surgeon General's
9        reports.
10              You heard about the Green Monster, where
11        Brown & Williamson and American published a
12        compendium on all the published literature on
13        smoking and health.  Gave it to the Surgeon
14        General's report.  The committee writing the
15        report in '64.
16              You heard about Dr. Rodgman from Reynolds
17        publishing his findings, giving speeches to the
18        American Cancer Society, sharing that
19        information with the public health community.
20              You heard how there are no secrets.  This
21        is one of Dr. Teague's everything stamped
22        secret and confidential.  These companies were
23        competitors.  This is business, saying this is
24        a confidential company document.  But no secret
25        on the substance.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              1942.  Tobacco is a means of
2        administering nicotine.
3              Dr. Teague, tobacco products a vehicle to
4        deliver nicotine.
5              I want to talk about filters just
6        quickly.
7              Plaintiffs made it seem like yesterday
8        for every minute of every time there was a
9        filter on a cigarette, it was an intentional
10        effort on the part of the tobacco industry to
11        addict and kill smokers.
12              And the truth couldn't be farther away
13        from that allegation.  Starting way back in the
14        '50s and '60s, the public health community and
15        tobacco companies started looking at ways to
16        make cigarettes better.  And filters was one of
17        the things they came up with.
18              You can see in 1979, a document that is
19        in evidence, which is on page XII.
20              The average tar and nicotine deliveries
21        have continued to decline.
22              This was encouraged by a series of
23        government actions beginning in '66.  They're
24        talking about using filters to reduce the
25        amount of tar and nicotine that smokers get.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              In 1996, the National Cancer Institute in
2        Monograph 7, again a document in evidence,
3        says: Today's filter-tipped and lower-tar
4        cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer
5        than in the higher tar and nicotine
6        predecessors.
7              The more recent case-control evidence
8        remains consistent with the first component of
9        this conclusion.
10              That's 1996.
11              Mr. Schlesinger read you 2013, and what
12        the Surgeon General says today.  This is where
13        presentism works against plaintiffs.  You can't
14        go back and judge the guys that were trying to
15        make cigarettes safer based on what they write
16        in 2014.
17              In the '60s and '70s, the public health
18        community was encouraging tobacco companies to
19        develop lower-tar cigarettes, to put filters on
20        them.
21              The bad stuff comes from burning tobacco.
22        If you can get that out of there, you would
23        solve a lot of these problems.  But it was a
24        joint effort.
25              The 2014 SGR doesn't change the
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        legitimacy of the effort to make cigarettes
2        better.
3              This is the document we talked about
4        where the head of R.J. Reynolds in 1968 to the
5        head of Reynolds science department said: If
6        there is a safer cigarette, let's continue and
7        increase our efforts in this program.  Please
8        prepare a plan to carry this out.
9              The document that Dr. Proctor has seen
10        dozens of times doesn't show it to you on
11        direct examination.  Let's get a plan in place.
12              This is Dr. Rodgman.  You heard about how
13        he worked with the National Cancer Institute.
14              National Cancer Institute writes him a
15        letter and says thank you.  I would like to
16        express my thanks and appreciation at the
17        National Cancer Institute for your substantial
18        contributions to this committee.
19              That's 1972.
20              Now, the National Cancer Institute closed
21        down the Tobacco Working Group.  But Reynolds
22        kept going.  You heard this from Dr. Proctor.
23              Reynolds developed Premier and later
24        Eclipse.  That's the monograph they published
25        showing all their research about it.  That
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        document is in evidence.
2              Dr. Proctor told you that Premier and
3        Eclipse reduced the carcinogens in smoke.
4        Premier went on the market in 1988.
5              Dr. Proctor told you -- I asked him:
6        Would you agree that Reynolds made a concerted
7        effort through Premier to address the concept
8        of bad things in smoke coming from the burning?
9              Yeah, I agree.  He said: The flaw is that
10        they didn't remove the other cigarettes.
11              He wants to ban cigarettes.
12              But with respect to mitigating evidence,
13        you have no connection to Mr. Moyer.
14              So you've got the other side of the coin.
15        The other side of the coin is a legitimate
16        effort from the folks at Reynolds and elsewhere
17        to try to reduce the risks of smoking, and
18        Eclipse is a big part of that.
19              And Dr. Proctor told you that was a
20        concerted effort.
21              The instructions also explain to you that
22        one of the reasons you might consider awarding
23        punitive damages is to deter future conduct.
24              And I want to take a little bit of time
25        to talk about how we're in a different world
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        today.
2              The first reason we're in a different
3        world you've heard repeatedly, there have been
4        a variety of settlements over the years.  All
5        the general conduct that you heard that's not
6        connected to Mr. Moyer.  That's what's behind
7        those settlements, that debt has been paid.
8        You can see this in the Surgeon General's
9        report.
10              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
11              THE COURT:  Sustained.
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Move to strike the
13        comment about that.
14              THE COURT:  Thank you.
15              Jury is to disregard.
16              Proceed, Counsel.
17              MR. BOYCE:  We'll go through the
18        documents.
19              Now there is no more TI, no more CTR, no
20        more TIRC.  The advertising is restricted, and
21        the FDA controls the manufacture, design,
22        nicotine level, ingredients and advertising of
23        cigarettes.  Period.
24              This comes from the documents in
25        evidence.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              2012 Surgeon General reports says that
2        the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement resulted
3        in taking down billboard advertising, transit
4        advertising, as well as advertising that
5        targeted underage youth.
6              It also created the American Legacy
7        Foundation, which implemented a nationwide
8        anti-smoking campaign targeting youth.
9              It worked.  Due in part to these changes,
10        there was a decrease in tobacco use among
11        adults and among youth following the Master
12        Settlement Agreement, which is documented in
13        this report.  The Master Settlement Agreement
14        is from 1998.
15              In 2009, the FDA was given authority over
16        the manufacturing, marketing, distribution,
17        design of tobacco products.  It restricts where
18        they can be sold and how they can be
19        advertised.
20              The FDA could establish product standards
21        for nicotine yields, take out any ingredients,
22        do anything they want to do.
23              But today in this country, it's the FDA
24        that decides what goes in cigarettes.  It
25        decides how they're made, it decides how much
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        nicotine is in them.  They are in control of
2        all of this.
3              Dr. Proctor disagrees, because the FDA
4        hasn't done anything yet.  But they are in
5        control of all of this.  There is nothing to
6        deter.
7              The FDA controls the way cigarettes are
8        made, designed, and how much nicotine is in
9        them.
10              They haven't made any changes.  Okay?
11        They haven't made any changes since 2009.  They
12        haven't taken nicotine out.  You've heard
13        repeatedly they haven't said: Take this
14        ingredient out.
15              And the simple fact of that is there's no
16        such thing as a safe cigarette.  When you burn
17        tobacco, you get bad things in there.
18              But the mitigating evidence shows that
19        there was a legitimate effort to make
20        cigarettes better.
21              And this stuff, from the FDA being in
22        charge, shows you there's nothing to deter.
23        There's no need in this case for punitive
24        damages.
25              No connection between what
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        Mr. Schlesinger talks about and Mr. Moyer,
2        mitigating evidence that Dr. Proctor didn't
3        show you.
4              Finally, no need to deter it because the
5        FDA controls the way they're designed, the way
6        they're made, what goes in them, the way
7        they're sold and the way they're advertised.
8              Last topic.
9              Thank you again for your attention.  I
10        know I've been talking for a long time.  I
11        really do appreciate it.  I know it's hard to
12        sit there and listen to charts and go quickly.
13              You guys are remarkable.  You always pay
14        attention.  Every time I look around, everybody
15        is right there, engaged, and that's something
16        when this is over, that you all should be proud
17        of.  You all should be proud of the way you
18        performed as jurors in this case.
19              The last topic I want to talk about is
20        who is responsible for this.  This is question
21        number 7 on the verdict form.  You're going to
22        be instructed.
23              It says: State the percentage of any
24        responsibility for any of Dale Moyer's
25        smoking-related diseases.
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1              You're going to be instructed, because
2        Mr. Moyer admits that he has some
3        responsibility in this case, that you have to
4        put down a number for Mr. Moyer.  You can't put
5        zero.
6              But I want to make another point about
7        this.
8              The only way these percentages come into
9        play is if you answer no on the reliance
10        questions.
11              If you answer yes on the reliance
12        questions, you'll be eliminating any
13        responsibility you think Mr. Moyer should bear
14        for his smoking.  You'll see it in the
15        instructions.
16              It's actually on page 29.
17              And it tells you that the Court will
18        enter a judgment based on your verdict, and
19        unless you found for plaintiff on her
20        fraudulent concealment or conspiracy claims,
21        the Court in entering the judgment will reduce
22        the total amount of damages by the percentage
23        of negligence which you find attributable to
24        Mr. Moyer.
25              So your first instruction, that you have
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        to put something down because Mr. Moyer admits
2        that he has some responsibility here.
3              But I want you to understand that on
4        those reliance questions, those fraud and fraud
5        concealment questions where reliance is a part
6        of that.  If you answer yes on that, you're
7        finding that the defendants are 100 percent
8        responsible for everything Mr. Moyer did on the
9        smoking.
10              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge, move
11        to strike.  That's -- just --
12              THE COURT:  Thank you.
13              Objection sustained.
14              MR. BOYCE:  It's on page 29.  It says:
15        Unless you find for plaintiff on her fraudulent
16        concealment and conspiracy claims, the Court
17        will reduce the total amount of damages.
18              You can figure out for yourself the flip
19        side of that when you review the instructions.
20              But I want to start -- excuse me, I want
21        to finish sort of where we started.  That's the
22        concept of personal responsibility.
23              The idea that smoking is a choice.  The
24        idea that people make a decision whether to
25        smoke cigarettes, and they most importantly
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        make their own decisions about when to stop and
2        how to do it.
3              We know that it takes continuous effort.
4        We know that it takes motivation.
5              But I want to talk a little bit about
6        personal responsibility.
7              When Mr. Hammer filled out the chart of
8        responsibility, he had 40 percent for Reynolds,
9        40 percent for Lorillard, 15 percent for
10        Liggett and 5 percent for Mr. Moyer.
11              5 percent out of 100.
12              I will leave this to your sound
13        discretion.
14              But what Mr. Hammer is basically
15        suggesting is when Mr. Moyer got up in the
16        morning, looked at himself in the mirror, only
17        5 percent of Mr. Moyer is there, that
18        95 percent of the mirror, the person looking
19        back at him, as he decided what to do with his
20        life and his day, whether he was going to smoke
21        or drink or gamble or eat or exercise or golf
22        or play cards, the person looking back in the
23        mirror, according to plaintiffs, is 95 percent
24        tobacco companies.
25              I leave it to your sound discretion.  You
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        do not leave your common sense at the door.  Is
2        that the way we lead our lives?  Is that the
3        way we lead our lives in this country?
4              When you look in the mirror at the
5        beginning of your day, there's only one person
6        looking back at you, and it's you.
7              A person with free will.  It's not a
8        fish.
9              Addiction doesn't change this.  In this
10        case, addiction means he smoked a lot.  He
11        smoked in the morning.  If you took it away
12        from him, he was irritable.  It's not a legal
13        cause.
14              You look in the mirror, there's one face
15        looking back at you.  Not 5 percent of a face.
16        100 percent of a face, a man, a life.
17              The thing plaintiffs want you to skip
18        right over, ignore the drawbridge and use him
19        as a conduit for punitive damages.
20              That's not what this case is about.
21        That's not the way life is led.  It's not what
22        personal responsibility means in this country.
23        We saw it throughout this case.
24              Did I go too fast?

3              VOICE:  In my opinion, people should be
4        warned of the dangers, and they are being
5        warned.  What they then want to do, whether
6        they wish to smoke or not, is their own
7        business.
8              (Video clip concluded.)
9              MR. BOYCE:  That's Dr. Hammond way back
10        in 1955.
11              This is Harry Reasoner in 1964 making the
12        same point.
13 14 15              follows:)
16              VOICE:  In this kind of a country, it
17        comes down to you, whether you like it or not.
18        No one is going to forbid an adult to smoke.
19        And it is now quite clear that no one is going
20        to tell him it's good for him either.
21              The decision is his.  The decision and
22        the health that may depend on it.
23              (Video clip concluded.)
24              MR. BOYCE:  It's the same thing
25        Dr. Seidman told you when we looked at his app
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        that he sells to smokers to help them quit
2        smoking.
3 4 5              follows:)
6              VOICE:  Urges and cravings to smoke are
7        not choices.  However, the action you take in
8        response to the urges and cravings is a choice.
9              The cigarette has no magical power,
10        except which you give it.  When not acted on,
11        urges to smoke, no matter how powerful, occur
12        less often and become easier to ignore.
13              By not acting on the urge to smoke, you
14        choose voluntarily to protect your body and
15        your health.  You choose not to act on the urge
16        to smoke because you truly believe this will
17        make life better.
18              (Video clip concluded.)
19              MR. BOYCE:  That's a choice.  That's
20        plaintiff's addiction expert in the app he
21        sells to smokers saying quite clearly, wanting
22        to smoke, feeling an urge, that may not be a
23        choice.
24              But what you do, that person in the
25        mirror, what you do in response to it is a
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        choice.  Because it's a choice, you're
2        responsible for it.
3              This is the same attitude Mr. Moyer took
4        when he decided to buy a nightclub and sell
5        cigarettes himself.  It's the same attitude the
6        Mumtazes had when they sold cigarettes at a
7        chain of convenience stores.
8              MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
9              THE COURT:  Thank you.
10              Sustained.  That's not the issue.
11              MR. BOYCE:  And it's the same attitude
12        Mr. Moyer had for his smoking and his life.
13              If there's one piece of evidence I would
14        encourage you to keep in your mind when
15        Mr. Schlesinger gets back up here, Mr. Moyer
16        quit smoking the first time he put a continuous
17        effort to stop, and that Mr. Moyer passed away
18        at age 83, after a life full of fun and
19        enjoyment.  Smoking never made him miss
20        anything.  He saw his daughters grow to middle
21        age.  His grandkids grow to 16.
22              Most importantly, when he passed away, it
23        was 13 years after he decided to stop smoking,
24        and he died from a metastatic skin cancer.  I
25        want to thank you again for your time and
United Reporting, Inc.
954.525.2221

1        attention.
2              I hope you've enjoyed your time as jurors
3        half as much as I've enjoyed the opportunity to
4        present Reynolds' case to you.  I look forward
5        to your verdict.
6              But again, on behalf of Miss Amadi,
7        Mr. Harrison, Mr. Gentile on the computer
8        there, thank you for your time and attention.


3        MS. RUIZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May it
4  please the Court.
5        Good morning, everyone.
6        JURORS:  Good morning.
7        MS. RUIZ:  You'll be glad to hear that,
8  as you've seen during this trial, I'm going to
9  try not to repeat what you've already heard.
10        It's been a pleasure to be before you in
11  Judge Murphy's court, and I also want to thank
12  you on my behalf, on Ms. Manseur's behalf, on
13  Liggett's behalf, for the careful attention
14  that you've paid to this case.
15        When this trial began, I gave a brief
16  opening statement, where I told you a little
17  bit about my client and what the evidence was
18  going to show about Mr. Moyer.
19        Now we're at the end of this trial, and
20  Mr. Boyce did an excellent job of explaining to
21  you why plaintiff failed to meet her burden on
22  all of her claims against all defendants, but
23  it is plaintiff's burden to prove her case
24  against each defendant, so I need to cover what
25  the evidence was with respect to my client,

1  Liggett.
2        We all have sympathy for the Moyer
3  family.  That does not mean that Liggett is
4  responsible because Mr. Moyer chose to smoke
5  its cigarettes for such a short period of time.
6        When you consider the evidence in this
7  case, please use your natural reason and your
8  common sense.  You didn't check that at the
9  door when you got here, and I ask that you
10  please rely on that when you return to the jury
11  room to deliberate and evaluate the testimony
12  of the various people who came here to talk to
13  you during this trial.
14        So, with that in mind, what did the
15  evidence show?
16        This case is about two things:  First, of
17  course, it's about Mr. Moyer and the way he
18  lived his life; and, second, it's whether
19  Liggett, or any of the other defendants, did
20  anything or said anything that influenced
21  Mr. Moyer or his decisions.
22        Nothing that Liggett did influenced
23  Mr. Moyer's decisions or his behavior.
24  Mr. Moyer talked to you about that first
25  cigarette that he smoked.  It was a Lucky

1  Strike.  That's not a Liggett brand.  In fact,
2  the only Liggett brand you heard throughout
3  this trial was Chesterfield.
4        Mr. Moyer didn't decide to smoke that
5  first Lucky Strike cigarette because of any
6  Liggett advertising.  Mr. Moyer didn't mention
7  a Liggett ad once in the hours of testimony
8  that you saw from him.
9        After that first cigarette, Mr. Moyer
10  told you that he smoked occasionally with his
11  friends.  And, again, those cigarettes were
12  also Lucky Strikes.
13        After that, for about a 14-year period,
14  Mr. Moyer smoked three brands:  Lucky Strike,
15  Old Gold, and Chesterfield.
16        At first, he was smoking two cigarettes a
17  week; then he worked himself up to a cigarette
18  a day; and then later, towards the end of that
19  period, he was smoking a pack to a pack and a
20  half a day.
21        Now, Dr. Seidman, plaintiff's expert,
22  came here and showed you that chart of all the
23  brands that he thought that Mr. Moyer smoked.
24  He tried to convince you that the only brand
25  Mr. Moyer smoked while he was in the Army was

1  Chesterfield.
2        As you saw on cross-examination, he had
3  to agree that was an oversight on someone's
4  part, because Mr. Moyer told you that
5  Chesterfield was his least favorite of these
6  three brands, and that he smoked them, at most,
7  12-and-a-half percent of the time during that
8  early period.
9        So we know from his testimony that
10  Mr. Moyer smoked very little Liggett
11  cigarettes.  He was, predominantly, a Lucky
12  Strike smoker.
13        To avoid doing the math, let's just
14  assume that Mr. Moyer was smoking a pack a day
15  during that 14-year period of time.  We know
16  that's more than what he was smoking, because
17  he started out smoking only two cigarettes a
18  week, and it wasn't towards the end that he
19  worked himself up to a pack to a pack and a
20  half a day.
21        But just to make it easy, let's be
22  generous and say he was smoking a pack a day
23  for the entire period.  That would give him
24  1.75 pack-years of Liggett smoking.  That's
25  less than two pack-years, compared to the over

1  100 pack-years that Drs. Seidman and Wolek told
2  you that he smoked.
3        As you heard, he switched to Kent in the
4  1950s.  He didn't smoke a Liggett brand after
5  that.
6        Now, as I said, plaintiff has the burden
7  of proving that Liggett cigarettes caused
8  Mr. Moyer's illnesses.  She must prove
9  causation as to each defendant by the greater
10  weight of the evidence.
11        Here's the jury instruction.  It's a
12  mouthful.  Plaintiff, essentially, has to prove
13  that, but for Mr. Moyer's smoking of Liggett
14  cigarettes, he would not have gotten sick.
15        So, ask yourself, did his use of
16  Chesterfield cigarettes make a difference in
17  Mr. Moyer's outcome?
18        As one of plaintiff's own treating
19  physicians told you, the answer to that
20  question is no.
21        Here's what Dr. Wolek said.  He was
22  asked:  If Mr. Moyer had smoked five pack-years
23  less than what he did smoke, do you think he
24  still would have developed COPD?
25        His answer:  I have no idea.  I don't

1  think anybody can answer that question, but
2  would assume that the amount that he smoked, it
3  would not have made a difference.
4        Plaintiff did not present any evidence to
5  you to establish that, but for Mr. Moyer's
6  smoking of Chesterfield cigarettes, he wouldn't
7  have gotten sick.  And because she didn't meet
8  her burden on this point, if you get this far
9  along in the verdict form, you should check
10  "no" next to Liggett for Question 6.
11        Beyond that issue, there wasn't any
12  evidence that Liggett did or said or failed to
13  do or say anything that affected Mr. Moyer and
14  his smoking decisions in any way.
15        You heard a lot of arguments about
16  tobacco companies, and what they did or didn't
17  do.  I would like to talk about Liggett, and
18  what did Liggett do.
19        The evidence showed that Liggett was a
20  responsible tobacco company, took its own path.
21  We saw evidence that, in the 1950s, and
22  culminating with the 1964 Surgeon General's
23  report, there was emerging scientific evidence
24  about the risks of cigarette smoking.
25        One of the most widely publicized studies

1  was that Wynder/Graham mouse skin painting
2  study in 1953.
3        What does Liggett do in response to that
4  study?  Liggett didn't attend the Plaza Hotel
5  meeting, for example.  Mr. Schlesinger didn't
6  mention that when he talked to you about the
7  Plaza Hotel meeting in his closing.
8        Liggett didn't have anything to do with
9  the Frank Statement.  When he showed the Frank
10  Statement to you, he didn't tell you that
11  Liggett wasn't a part of that Frank Statement.
12        Liggett didn't join the TIRC.  Instead,
13  Liggett responded to that new information
14  coming out by taking an independent path.
15        Remember this 1958 document that
16  plaintiff put into evidence?  This is
17  Plaintiff's Exhibit 3289.
18        It's authored by British scientists who
19  visited the United States, they visited
20  Liggett, and here's what they report about
21  Liggett:  Liggett felt that the problem was
22  sufficiently serious to justify large-scale
23  investment by the company directly in
24  experimental research on smoking and cancer.
25        They go on to report:  We were told that

1  Liggett has already invested considerably more
2  in this work than the combined donations of the
3  rest of the industry to the TIRC.
4        That's at Page 5 of that document.
5        Liggett invested enormous resources in a
6  biological testing program with its consultant,
7  Arthur D. Little.
8        ADL was a preeminent scientific
9  consulting firm of its time.
10        And, together, Liggett and ADL set out to
11  do two things:  They wanted to see if the mouse
12  skin painting test results could be replicated,
13  and they wanted to see if there was anything in
14  cigarette smoke that was causing the problems.
15        This was an ongoing process, and both
16  Liggett and ADL shared their research with the
17  public, ultimately turning all of it over to
18  the Surgeon General's committee in April of
19  1963.
20        You might remember that stack of paper
21  that I had when I was talking to Dr. Proctor.
22  It's in these boxes.  It's Liggett Exhibit 231.
23        Liggett provided almost 10 years of
24  research to the committee in that submission.
25  It covered a lot of ground.

1        The members of the advisory committee
2  repeatedly praised Liggett and ADL for the
3  quality of the work and the amount of ground
4  that they covered in that research.
5        Here's the Assistant Surgeon General,
6  writing to Dr. Kensler at ADL.  This is Liggett
7  Exhibit 219.
8        The Assistant Surgeon General writes to
9  Liggett:  We feel that simple acknowledgment of
10  the receipt of the nine volumes which you
11  submitted to us is not sufficient.  Please
12  accept, on behalf of Liggett and ADL, our
13  special gratitude for the tremendous time,
14  effort, and expense in the production of this
15  material for our use, and that they were
16  grateful for the oral presentation made.
17        Here, in Liggett 2398, these are minutes
18  from a 1963 meeting of the Surgeon General's
19  committee.  And they report, in those minutes,
20  they can't possibly record the massive amount
21  of data in these reports.  The committee
22  thanked Drs. Kensler and Hainer on behalf of
23  the committee for their comprehensive and
24  well-organized presentation, as well as the
25  documents that had been prepared, and those

1  still to come.
2        Here again, in a memo from the U.S.
3  Department of Agriculture -- this is Liggett
4  6965 -- the chief of the tobacco laboratory for
5  the government said this about the submission:
6  The report contains a wealth of information,
7  especially with regard to the biological
8  responses of animal systems to cigarette smoke.
9        He goes on to report:  In view of the
10  voluminous amount of material contained in the
11  report, it would be impossible to record here
12  the many findings obtained in the 10-year
13  period of productive collaboration.
14        Now, Dr. Proctor shared with you this
15  document:  L&M:  A perspective review.  It's
16  Plaintiff's Exhibit 2138.
17        And he told you that Liggett didn't share
18  that there are biologically active materials
19  present in cigarette smoke that are
20  cancer-causing, cancer-promoting, poisonous,
21  stimulating, pleasurable, and flavorful.
22        He told you that Liggett didn't share
23  these top conclusions with the Surgeon General.
24  I invite you to look at the submission.  Again,
25  it's 231.  I think you'll see that Dr. Proctor

1  just didn't know what was in there.
2        There's a lot of information in there.
3  It's 700-plus pages.  I'm not going to go
4  through the whole thing.  Just to give you a
5  general idea of what's in there, I'll just
6  highlight a couple of them with you.
7        This is Volume 1 at Page 3.  You'll see
8  that Liggett's researchers concluded, there's
9  an association between cigarette smoking and
10  overall death rates.
11        They go on to say that the effect
12  increases with the amount smoked.  Liggett also
13  reported its finding with regard to filters.
14  Liggett never said that filters were safe.
15  Instead, Liggett told public health
16  officials -- this is Liggett 2398 -- that
17  condensate from filtered smoke is just as or
18  almost as carcinogenic as that from unfiltered
19  smoke.
20        Here, in the submission -- this is Volume
21  3, table of contents -- materials which have
22  been suggested as possible carcinogens for the
23  human lung.  It lists arsenic in there.  We
24  heard a lot of talk about arsenic.
25        Liggett also presented the results of its

1  own mouse skin painting studies, showing that
2  it produced carcinomas.  Liggett discusses
3  nicotine in the report.
4        Here, in the submission, Volume 3,
5  Appendix A, Liggett reports:  The action of
6  nicotine on the central nervous system is
7  complex.  It varies with the dose administered.
8  There's little doubt that nicotine is a potent
9  central nervous system stimulant, reporting
10  here that it works on the brain.
11        The submission goes on to say, in Volume
12  4:  Nicotine is a highly active pharmacologic
13  agent in tobacco.  The pleasurable effects of
14  nicotine are the reasons why people smoke.
15  Nicotine is a potent stimulant of various
16  chemoreceptors, and one of the most potent
17  central nervous system arousal agents known.
18        Clearly, this information was not
19  concealed by Liggett from the public health
20  officials whose job it was to protect the
21  health of the country.
22        Even with this information, public -- the
23  public health community didn't change the
24  definition of "addiction," or didn't find that
25  nicotine was addictive until 1988.  That's when

1  they changed the definition of "addiction," so
2  that cigarettes would fall within the -- within
3  that definition.
4        So, you see, contrary to what Dr. Proctor
5  tells you, Liggett's researchers showed the
6  committee that -- that -- that painting tar on
7  mouse skin backs causes tumors, that they
8  identified components of cigarette smoke that
9  are poisonous, they talked about how nicotine
10  is the reason that people smoke, they talked
11  about it being flavorful, stimulating,
12  pleasurable, and habit-forming.  Liggett was
13  not hiding the ball here.
14        Now, switching gears a little bit, you
15  heard a little bit about industry
16  organizations.  You heard that Liggett was not
17  a member of the Tobacco Industry Research
18  Committee.
19        Liggett did belong to the Council for
20  Tobacco Research, from March 1964 to March --
21  to January 1968.  The evidence showed that
22  Liggett was a minor player, at best, with these
23  organizations, contributing .3 percent to one
24  of them.
25        Ask yourself, what documents did you see

1  from any Liggett personnel, directing any of
2  these organizations to do anything.  Not a
3  single one.  No evidence of Liggett hiding the
4  ball here.  Not a single document shows Liggett
5  keeping secrets.
6        So when you go back to the jury room and
7  you evaluate Liggett's conduct, along with the
8  conduct of some of these other companies, ask
9  yourself, is there any evidence of Liggett's
10  involvement in concealing information?
11        The answer to that is no.
12        Of course, there's a crucial test for
13  evaluating these claims.  Did any of the
14  statements by any tobacco company, including
15  Liggett, play any role in Mr. Moyer's decision
16  to start and continue smoking.
17        The short answer is no.
18        We know that, from 1966 on, there were
19  warning labels on the packs.  They didn't make
20  a difference to Mr. Moyer.  As you heard, he
21  simply ignored them.
22        Ask yourself, what statement, what
23  advertising, what conduct whatsoever would have
24  made a difference.
25        He never identified anything that he saw

1  from Liggett.  There's nothing Liggett could
2  have done, that he would have relied upon, that
3  would have changed his mind.
4        And despite this information, Dr. Proctor
5  came here and he talked to you about
6  advertising in movies.  It's up to you to
7  decide whether Dr. Proctor had his own agenda.
8        As Mr. Boyce told you, he's been paid
9  handsomely to come here and tell you that
10  advertising drives market share.  Think about
11  how much Dr. Proctor's been paid to come and
12  tell you that, and please consider that when
13  weighing his credibility.
14        He's an advocate.  He advocates for the
15  abolition of cigarettes.  That's his choice,
16  but it's something you get to consider in
17  weighing his credibility.
18        Obviously, the goal of advertising is to
19  sell a product.  This wasn't unique to the
20  tobacco companies.  All companies do it.
21  Liggett was allowed to advertise its products.
22  That's not evidence of wrongdoing.
23        You heard a lot from plaintiff's counsel
24  about marketing to youth.  And, on that point,
25  I would just highlight, there's not a single

1  document from Liggett, showing any marketing to
2  youth.  So please remember that when you're
3  considering that issue.
4        Because plaintiff did not meet her burden
5  of proving that Mr. Moyer relied on any Liggett
6  statements or omissions, if you get this far
7  along in the verdict form, you should also
8  check "no" next to Liggett for Questions 8 and
9  9.
10        One of the last things I want to touch
11  upon with you is punitive damages.  Mr. Boyce
12  touched on it.
13        As you've heard, punitive damages are
14  intended to punish a defendant.  They must be
15  based on Liggett's conduct and how Liggett's
16  conduct impacted Mr. Moyer.
17        The burden here is on the plaintiff to
18  prove by clear and convincing evidence that
19  she's entitled to punitive damages.  We don't
20  think there's a basis for awarding punitive
21  damages, and we don't think you should even get
22  there; but, if you do, you need to decide
23  whether there's any evidence that any of the
24  alleged wrongful conduct by Liggett caused any
25  damage to Mr. Moyer, and whether it's necessary

1  to punish Liggett, or send a message to
2  Liggett, for the way it's currently doing
3  business.
4        Based on everything I've just told you,
5  punitive damages are not warranted here.
6  You've heard about Liggett's research in the
7  '50s.  Dr. Proctor told you that this was an
8  honest response to the mouse skin painting
9  studies when they came out.
10        After warnings were on the packs, Liggett
11  continued doing research.  It was the first
12  cigarette company to put voluntary warnings on
13  its cigarette packs.  I think the plaintiff
14  elicited that information from Dr. Proctor on
15  direct.
16        And today, of course, Liggett is the
17  smallest of the tobacco companies.  It has
18  about two percent of the market.  There's no
19  need to punish or deter Liggett here.
20        So I ask you, again, to please use your
21  intelligence, your common sense, looking at the
22  evidence in this case, and when you do that,
23  you'll find that there's no support for
24  plaintiff's claim for money damages or
25  punishment against Liggett.  Thank you.


3        MR. WOODS:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May
4  it please the Court.
5        Good afternoon.
6        JURORS:  Good afternoon.
7        MR. WOODS:  Again, my name is David
8  Woods.  And on behalf of Mr. Batista and
9  Lorillard Tobacco Company, I also want to thank
10  you for the time that you've put in, the
11  attention that you've paid so far, and for the
12  work that you'll do in deliberations.  We
13  really do appreciate it.
14        Now, if you'll excuse me for a second, I
15  do need to grab one thing over here.
16        You'll remember, during opening
17  statements, I told you that this case, when
18  you -- when you really strip it down, when you
19  look at it fundamentally, that it's about two
20  things:  Control and responsibility.
21        Mr. Moyer was the only person in control
22  of his smoking decisions.  He was the person
23  who was in control of when he was going to try
24  to quit, how long he was going to try to quit,
25  the effort he was going to put into trying to

1  quit.
2        Because he was the only person in control
3  of his smoking decisions -- and other decisions
4  in his life that he made, that came with
5  risk -- he is the one who is ultimately
6  responsible for the decisions that he made.
7        Now, I think the evidence has shown that
8  his family understood that throughout the
9  entire time that he was smoking.  They
10  respected his choices.
11        Now, no doubt, they did not like his
12  smoking.  They thought it smelled bad, they
13  thought it was disgusting, it stained the
14  walls.
15        But when it came down to asking him to
16  quit, helping him to quit, I think the evidence
17  was clear that they respected his decisions and
18  understood that it was his decision, and his
19  decision alone, to smoke, or to quit, or when
20  to quit.
21        Now, Mr. Moyer was not a man who could be
22  forced to change course in his life.  He made
23  decisions.  He made decisions about a lot of
24  aspects of his life:  Whether to smoke, whether
25  to drink, whether to lose weight, take care of

1  himself, and in other aspects of his life.  And
2  he understood that those choices came with
3  risks.  Health risks, other risks.
4        And we saw his perspective on risk, which
5  is understandable.  There's a risk in
6  everything.  You take the risk.
7        And I want to be clear here.  I'm not
8  criticizing, and nobody from the defense is
9  criticizing, any of the decisions that
10  Mr. Moyer made throughout his entire life.
11  What we are saying is that he is 100 percent
12  responsible for the decisions that he made.
13        Now, I'm not going to repeat everything,
14  thankfully, everything that Mr. Boyce said, or
15  that Ms. Ruiz said.  They spent a lot of time
16  talking to you, and so I don't want to go back
17  and replow that same ground.
18        Although, I did want to show Question
19  Number 3, because this is important.  This is a
20  key component to the class membership question.
21        Let me get out of the way here.
22        And you really see this is a two-part
23  question.  The first part is:  Was Dale Moyer
24  addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?
25        Was he addicted?  That's the first

1  question.
2        And, on that, plaintiff's counsel is
3  right, there's no definition.  There's no
4  definition in the jury instructions.  That's up
5  to you.  And we'll respect your decision on
6  that.
7        Where I want to focus on is the second
8  part, the second part of the question, which
9  is:  If so, even if he was addicted, was his
10  addiction a legal cause of his smoking-related
11  illnesses?
12        And, again, the concept of legal cause is
13  not necessarily the same as medical cause.  And
14  I used an example in opening statement of a
15  person who walks across the street and gets hit
16  by a truck.
17        Well, spending a little more time, seeing
18  the water, seeing the beach, I have another
19  example to help illustrate legal cause and how
20  it's different from and can be different from
21  medical cause.
22        If somebody goes down to the beach, goes
23  down Las Olas Boulevard, goes down to the
24  beach, and they decide to go swimming, and they
25  see that the red flag is up and they see that

1  there's surf, but they've gone into that surf
2  all their life, swam all the time, every day --
3        First time they went in, they swam, they
4  didn't get -- they didn't get pulled out in a
5  rip current, they didn't drown.  They hear
6  about other people drowning, they hear about
7  people that go and get pulled out in rip tides,
8  but it's never happened to them.  They don't
9  think it's going to happen to them; it happens
10  to other people.
11        And, so, time after time, they go in and
12  they swim, despite the red flag, despite the
13  current; and then, one time, an unfortunate
14  thing happens and it does happen to them.  They
15  do get pulled out in the rip current and,
16  unfortunately, they drown and they die.
17        The medical cause -- the medical cause of
18  that person's death, no doubt, it's drowning;
19  but what's the legal cause?  What's the legal
20  cause of that death?
21        The legal cause is going in the water to
22  swim.  Even if you don't think it's going to
23  happen to you, going in the water to swim,
24  despite the red flags, despite maybe people
25  telling you, hey, you shouldn't go in the water

1  because there are rip currents.
2        Not believing that it's going to happen
3  to you does not absolve you from the
4  consequences of the choices that you make.
5        And, again, I'm not going to go through
6  all the evidence on addiction, I'm not going to
7  go through all of the evidence on Mr. Moyer's
8  attempts to quit, what he said and -- what he
9  said about how hard he tried to quit, because
10  we all know that he did quit.  He quit in 2000.
11  He quit in 2000, when, as he said, it hit the
12  fan for him.  And, so, there's no doubt that he
13  could quit.  There's no doubt that he could
14  quit when he was motivated.
15        And motivation comes from within.  When
16  he was finally motivated, he quit smoking.  He
17  quit smoking for good.  He never relapsed, day
18  after day, week after week, month after month,
19  for 13 years.  Never smoked a single cigarette
20  again.
21        Now, as you heard from Dr. Civantos,
22  that's important.  And, interestingly, it was
23  actually in response to one of your own
24  questions.
25        When Dr. Civantos was asked:  If he would

1  have quit, if Mr. Moyer would have quit in 1993
2  or 1994, when plaintiff's counsel said he was
3  first diagnosed with COPD, could he have
4  avoided his injury?
5        And Dr. Civantos said:  Probably, yes,
6  things would have been different for Mr. Moyer
7  if he would have quit at that point.  Legal
8  cause.
9        Now, I want to talk a little bit about
10  Mr. Moyer and his awareness of the health risks
11  of smoking.  And it's clear that he was aware
12  of the health risks of smoking for a long, long
13  time; back into the 1950s, at least.
14        You know, when I first started off, I
15  thanked you.  I also want to apologize.  I've
16  been over there, coughing.  Since the first day
17  of trial, I've had a cold.  And so if I've
18  annoyed you with my coughing, I apologize.
19  But, fortunately, the trial's about over.
20        But, anyway, here's why --
21        And you've seen this -- and I'm not going
22  to belabor it, but you've seen why awareness is
23  important, because it comes down to the issue
24  of reasonable reliance.
25        And Mr. Boyce showed you the instruction

1  that -- and I won't show it to you again --
2  but, in essence, it said:  If you -- if you
3  know that smoking causes lung cancer, if you
4  believe that smoking causes lung cancer and
5  emphysema and disease, you can't have relied on
6  any statement to the contrary.  And that is --
7        That, frankly, goes back to 1965.
8  Mr. Moyer said -- and this is --
9        Frankly, I put this up here because I
10  didn't want there to be any concern whatsoever
11  that Mr. Boyce or any of us would somehow cut
12  off an answer or leave a misleading impression.
13  So I want to put up what -- what the entire
14  question and answer was, which I think
15  Mr. Boyce intended to read, but we've been
16  having technical difficulties all day.
17        But, again, here it is.  You can see it.
18        At the time you saw Edward R. Murrow's
19  commercial, you believed it?
20        Yeah.  He had no reason to lie about it.
21        And, again, that was in 1965.  So, as of
22  1965 --
23        And you saw these questions.  And there
24  are, I think, maybe four of them, on the
25  verdict form.  They go to reasonable reliance.

1  And in order for the defense to be liable for
2  any alleged concealment, any conspiracy,
3  anything like that, Mr. Moyer has to have
4  relied on a statement by that defendant, for
5  that defendant to be liable, after 1982.
6        There are questions that relate to before
7  1982.  I think, on the evidence, given what
8  Mr. Moyer believed himself in 1965, the answers
9  to all these questions about reasonable
10  reliance, whether before May 5, 1982, or after
11  May 5, 1982, it's all no.
12        But, again, I want to walk through
13  particularly --
14        And for most -- for most of my time, I
15  want to focus on Lorillard and what the
16  evidence was about Lorillard, but --
17        I want to talk about Lorillard and the
18  evidence you saw; but, before I say that, I
19  want you to think about this:  The --
20        All of the documents that Mr. Schlesinger
21  went through in his closing argument,
22  everything that he flashed up, other than some
23  Kent advertisements which I'll talk about in a
24  minute, everything that he flashed up was not a
25  Lorillard document.

1        I think, with Dr. Proctor, I counted over
2  80 documents total that were used on direct
3  examination with Mr. Gdanski.  Of those, I
4  think I counted about five or so Lorillard
5  documents.  And we'll talk about some of those
6  today.  Again, not including ads, but I'll get
7  to those in a second.
8        But, again, all of those documents, not
9  from Lorillard.  But I would submit to you,
10  even if you took all those documents --
11        If you took every document -- company
12  document over here, you boxed it up, and if you
13  gave it to Mr. Moyer years and years ago, it
14  would not have made a difference to him in his
15  smoking decisions, because he knew smoking
16  could cause lung cancer, emphysema, other
17  diseases.  And he knew it as far back as 1965,
18  so --
19        And there's no surprise why.  As you've
20  seen --
21        Rather than show you a bunch of them, I
22  wanted to do it this way; but you've seen,
23  there are --
24        And they're all in evidence.  You have
25  seen newspaper articles, magazine articles, on

1  the TV, the health risks of smoking were
2  something that were talked about in the '40s,
3  '50s, '60s, a long time ago.  A long time ago.
4        Now, Mr. Moyer said that he switched to
5  smoking -- or switched to Kent, sorry, in 1955.
6  He smoked Kent from 1955 to 1975.
7        I think Mr. Schlesinger said 25 years in
8  his closing, but I think he misspoke.  Twenty
9  years, 1955 to 1975.
10        So, you'll remember the advertisements,
11  the Kent advertisements that plaintiff's
12  counsel showed to Dr. Proctor.  Bob Cousy --
13        Bob Cousy was a great basketball player;
14  not so much of an actor.  But you had Bob
15  Cousy, you had more scientists and educators
16  smoked Kent; but what you also saw, on
17  cross-examination, those Kent advertisements
18  ran in 1960, one year, 1960, five years
19  after -- five years after Mr. Moyer says that
20  he switched to Kent.
21        So he didn't rely on more scientists and
22  educators, or Bob Cousy, or those
23  advertisements in his decision to smoke Kent.
24        And, again, 1960 is 22 years before -- 22
25  years before 1982.  1955, when he switched to

1  Kent, 27 years before 1982.
2        And to be clear, in case there's any
3  doubt, Mr. Moyer said the last Kent
4  advertisements that he -- that he recalls
5  seeing were from the 1950s and the 1960s, years
6  before that 1982 cutoff.
7        It's not even close on the issue of
8  reasonable reliance on a Lorillard statement.
9  The connection between Lorillard and Mr. Moyer
10  in this case is the Kent brand of cigarettes.
11  The Kent -- a brand that he stopped smoking in
12  1975.  Clearly, no reliance on anything
13  Lorillard said after 1982.
14        Now, I want to talk to you -- I want to
15  switch gears and I want to talk a little bit
16  about punitive damages and comparative fault,
17  because plaintiff's counsel spent, frankly,
18  more time talking about punitive damages than
19  they did talking about Dale Moyer.
20        You've seen the instructions on punitive
21  damages, and I'm not going to go over them with
22  you again; but, again, it's a higher burden of
23  proof on the plaintiff to prove punitive
24  damages.
25        You can only punish for harm to Dale

1  Moyer, not for any number of smokers out there.
2  It's harm to Dale Moyer.  And the standard for
3  punitive damages has to be based on intentional
4  misconduct.  Intentional misconduct.
5        And you're instructed, I think, on
6  negligence, and those types of things.
7  Negligence is like --
8        And the Judge has instructed you, but
9  negligence is like when you get in your car and
10  if you're texting or you're not paying
11  attention, or you're fiddling with the radio,
12  or you speed and you hit somebody.  That's
13  negligence.
14        Recklessness -- which isn't even
15  enough -- recklessness would be if you got in
16  your car, drunk, and hit somebody --
17        MR. HAMMER:  Objection.
18        MR. WOODS:  -- and caused an injury.
19        THE COURT:  Thank you.
20        Ladies and gentlemen, this is just
21  argument.  It's not an instruction on the law.
22        Proceed.
23        MR. WOODS:  Thank you.
24        Intentional misconduct would be driving
25  your car and intending to hit somebody.  That's

1  not what we have here.
2        Now, I want to walk through some of the
3  evidence about Lorillard, I want to walk
4  through some of the evidence about Lorillard's
5  effort in the past to understand what was in
6  cigarettes, to try to reduce the hazards of
7  cigarettes.  And you saw this evidence when I
8  cross-examined Dr. Proctor.
9        But before I talk about that, I want to
10  talk a little bit about youth marketing.  And,
11  again, documents that you may have seen, either
12  with Dr. Proctor or by Mr. Schlesinger in his
13  closing argument, none of those documents were
14  from Lorillard.
15        Frankly, you saw a lot of documents about
16  Philip Morris, who Mr. Moyer never smoked their
17  products.
18        And one piece of evidence you heard was
19  this idea of product placement, that Philip
20  Morris may have paid money to put Marlboro in
21  the Superman movie, so that if somebody was
22  watching Superman, they would see Marlboro in
23  the background.
24        Well, what you heard from Dr. Proctor is
25  that Lorillard not only did not do that, but

1  had a policy not to do that, at least as far
2  back as the 1970s, for at least 40 years, and
3  up through today, not to do product placement.
4        But I want to talk to you about
5  Lorillard's efforts to try to understand what's
6  in cigarettes and to try to reduce the hazards
7  of cigarettes.
8        You heard a lot about Dr. Wynder.
9  Dr. Wynder -- Wynder, Graham, and Croninger,
10  you remember they were the ones that did the
11  big mouse skin painting study back in 1953.
12        They were the ones who plaintiff's
13  counsel said caused all the companies to go to
14  the hotel and to have a big meeting to -- to
15  put out the Frank Statement.
16        But when Dr. Wynder, and Graham, and
17  Croninger did their study in 1953, the mouse
18  skin painting study, Lorillard didn't say, oh
19  my goodness, Dr. Wynder's come up -- he's going
20  to find out the truth.  We've got to shut this
21  down.  We can't have him doing this.
22        No.  What Lorillard did was, they said,
23  he's doing good research.  We're going to send
24  him cigarettes so that he can continue doing
25  his research.  In fact, we're going to work

1  with him for the next 15 or so years, looking
2  at things like phenols.
3        You remember the phenols.  Those were
4  the -- that was the compound in cigarette smoke
5  that scientists thought might interfere with
6  the clearance mechanisms to get -- help get the
7  tar and the gunk out of the lungs after you
8  smoke.
9        Lorillard was doing that research, doing
10  it with Dr. Wynder, who you remember
11  Dr. Proctor called a giant, a big deal, a huge
12  scientist at the time.  Also Dr. Hoffmann, who
13  was one of -- a public health scientist who was
14  an expert on cigarette design and cigarette
15  chemistry.
16        Lorillard actually patented filters to
17  remove phenols from cigarette smoke, put them
18  on its brands, actually published the results
19  of its research on phenols.  And you may recall
20  during the cross -- or the redirect
21  examination --
22        I think you've seen that where -- when
23  the plaintiff calls a witness --
24        Because they have the burden of proof,
25  they go first.  Then we go, and then they get

1  the last word.  And, frankly, we can't respond.
2        And it will happen again today.  And
3  that's the way the rules are, and that's fine.
4  But understand that when Mr. Schlesinger gets
5  up, there's no way for us to stand up and rebut
6  anything that he says.
7        It's the same way with witnesses.  It was
8  the same way with Dr. Proctor.  And, so, after
9  I was done, I sat down.  Mr. Gdanski, at the
10  very end of his redirect examination of
11  Dr. Proctor, he showed a document that
12  suggested that Dr. Spears of Lorillard was told
13  by his boss, you cannot publish your phenols
14  research.
15        And you may recall, I jumped up and said,
16  Judge, one question, just one question on
17  recross.
18        Dr. Proctor knew exactly where I was
19  going, because --
20        MR. HAMMER:  Objection, Judge.
21        THE COURT:  Sustained.
22        MR. WOODS:  -- we had actually
23  discussed --
24        We had actually discussed the publication
25  of the phenols, the same one at issue in that

1  document, during the -- during my
2  cross-examination of Dr. Proctor.  It was the
3  quantitative determination of phenols in
4  cigarette smoke.
5        Dr. Proctor said, without me having to
6  stand up, yes, that was actually published.
7        And, so, Lorillard published its research
8  on phenols.  It continued its work with Wynder
9  and Hoffmann for years.
10        You heard about Liggett's submission to
11  the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee.  You
12  also saw, with Dr. Proctor, Lorillard had a
13  submission to the Surgeon General's Advisory
14  Committee, identified various compounds in
15  smoke.  Among them, benzo(a)pyrene, which
16  Lorillard identified as a potential carcinogen,
17  as well as phenols.
18        Lorillard gave its research on phenols to
19  the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee, and
20  the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee also
21  thanked Lorillard.
22        Lorillard's research continued.  You
23  remember the research on PMO -- I think it's
24  phenylmethyl oxidase, PMO -- that Lorillard was
25  looking into as a potential way to counteract

1  the effect of phenols again.  They actually
2  made a presentation to the National Cancer
3  Institute on that.
4        Lorillard developed a highly
5  sophisticated smoking machine to help
6  scientists do research on smoking and cancer,
7  to better do animal research.  To better do
8  animal research.  They made this machine
9  available to other researchers and to other
10  labs.
11        Now, you saw a bunch of documents with
12  Dr. Proctor, and you saw a bunch of documents
13  in Mr. Schlesinger's closing argument, that
14  talked about nicotine.  People smoke for
15  nicotine.  You know, addiction, sine qua non,
16  all those documents.
17        Well, first of all, of the documents that
18  you saw with Dr. Proctor on nicotine and
19  addiction, and that type of thing, I think
20  there were two Lorillard documents, which I'm
21  going to talk about.  During --
22        All of the documents that you saw with
23  Mr. Schlesinger during closing argument, none
24  of those were Lorillard documents.
25        Like I said when I stood up in opening

1  statement, I'm not going to try to defend
2  what -- what every -- what people may have said
3  in documents years ago.
4        Some of them may be taken out of context;
5  other of them may be just stupid things that
6  people said.  But the key is, the plaintiff has
7  to connect that to Mr. Moyer, and he just
8  simply has not done it.  So --
9        But in terms of Lorillard and Lorillard's
10  nicotine research, when you look into the
11  evidence, you'll see no documents -- you'll see
12  no documents from Lorillard, saying, we think
13  smoking is addictive, we're trying to
14  manipulate nicotine to addict smokers.  You
15  won't see it.
16        What you will see is, you'll see
17  documents like this:  Lorillard's Nicotine
18  Augmentation Project.
19        Now, you see something like "Nicotine
20  Augmentation Project," and you think, that
21  doesn't sound good.  That sounds like Lorillard
22  is manipulating nicotine in an effort to hook
23  smokers.
24        As you heard from Dr. Proctor on the
25  stand during my cross-examination, that's

1  what -- not what this was about at all.  That
2  was about recommendations from health-oriented
3  agencies.
4        You remember, it was a -- the idea of the
5  low tar, medium nicotine, that people were
6  smoking lower and lower tar and nicotine
7  products.  And the thought was, well, if
8  they're smoking for nicotine, if they're
9  compensating and smoking more to get more
10  nicotine, then why don't we try to have a
11  lower-tar cigarette, but raise the level of
12  nicotine so that people won't compensate, so
13  that they won't smoke more, so that they won't
14  get more of the tar; because, again, the tar is
15  the bad stuff.  The tar is what causes cancer,
16  what causes disease.  Nicotine doesn't cause
17  cancer.  Just -- just inhaling nicotine does
18  not cause cancer.
19        So, again, the idea behind this Nicotine
20  Augmentation Project was not an effort to hook
21  smokers or addict smokers; it was trying to be
22  responsive to what the public health community
23  was telling Lorillard and the other companies
24  to do:  Try out this idea of a low-tar,
25  medium-nicotine cigarette.

1        And, again, it wasn't just Lorillard's
2  idea.  Sir Richard Doll -- the "sir" in front
3  of his name, he was actually knighted -- he
4  was -- he was involved in some of the earliest
5  statistical epidemiological research on smoking
6  and lung cancer back in the day, back in the
7  1950s.  And he continued his research for
8  years.  He was actually knighted for that.  He
9  thought the idea of low-tar, medium-nicotine
10  cigarettes were a good idea.
11        Dr. Russell, I spoke about him with
12  Dr. Proctor.  He was an expert in nicotine, a
13  pharmacologist.  He also thought this idea had
14  potential, was a good idea.  Consumer
15  Reports --
16        It wasn't just the scientists who were
17  talking about these issues; it was also in the
18  public arena, whether this was a good idea,
19  whether this could be a way to help reduce the
20  health risks of smoking.
21        The 1981 Surgeon General's report, as
22  well, also talked about the potential for
23  low-tar, medium-nicotine cigarettes.
24        Now, plaintiff's counsel talked to you
25  about the fact that the companies control the

1  amount of nicotine in cigarettes.  And that's
2  true.  There's no doubt about that, and there's
3  no secret to that.
4        Anybody who's ever been a smoker knows
5  that some cigarettes, unfiltered cigarettes,
6  for example, higher tar and nicotine, have a --
7  they're much stronger than maybe a light
8  cigarette or something that has very little tar
9  and nicotine.
10        The companies, if you have a light, you
11  always want it to be light.  If you have a
12  full-flavored, or an unfiltered, you always
13  want it to taste like a full-flavored or an
14  unfiltered.
15        If you were selling Kent, like Lorillard,
16  you would want to make sure that every pack of
17  Kent had about the same amount of tar and about
18  the same amount of nicotine.
19        Now, Kent, you have different levels, you
20  have higher-tar and lower-tar Kents; but if
21  you're smoking Kent, you don't want to go to
22  your Kents one day and find one pack is super
23  strong and your next pack is super weak.  You
24  want product consistency.
25        The tobacco companies make sure that they

1  have a consistent amount of tar and nicotine in
2  every cigarette, in the same way that
3  Starbuck's makes sure that it blends its beans
4  to have the same amount, roughly, of caffeine,
5  or the same strength.
6        Likewise, with the Coca-Cola company,
7  when they put together Coca-Cola, same amount
8  of caffeine, same amount of sugar in every
9  bottle.  It's a matter of product consistency.
10        For years, the amount of tar and nicotine
11  were measured by -- by the FTC; and, so,
12  whatever amounts of tar were in there, and
13  whatever amounts of nicotine were in there,
14  were reported for years.
15        So this idea that the companies
16  super-engineered cigarettes to make them, I
17  think, what Dr. Proctor calls one of the most
18  highly engineered small products in history, I
19  just have one word to say about that:  IPhone.
20  A cigarette compared to an iPhone.  It is not
21  even close.
22        But I digress.  I want to move on --
23        Now, when you get to issues of
24  comparative fault -- the same things I've been
25  talking about, when you get to the issues of

1  comparative fault, think about that.  Think
2  about the lack of evidence against Lorillard in
3  this case.  Think about Dr. Wynder.  Think
4  about NAP.  Think about the research that
5  Lorillard was doing.
6        If you get there -- and I don't think you
7  should get there, and I don't think you will
8  get there -- but if you do get there, think
9  about that when you're thinking about a number
10  to put down for Lorillard.
11        And I think, as Mr. Boyce said, the
12  amount that needs to go for the plaintiff,
13  there needs to be something there.  There
14  doesn't need to be any other number for any of
15  the defendants, because Mr. Moyer, while he was
16  alive, admitted that he was partially
17  responsible for his health-related problems.
18        The last thing I want to talk to you
19  about is damages.  Mr. Boyce, I thought, did a
20  good job of walking through the medical issues
21  in the case.  I don't want to --
22        I don't want to repeat any of that, but I
23  did want to say this:  When you retire back to
24  the jury room, I don't think you'll get to
25  damages, but I'm not doing my job if I don't

1  talk about it.  If you get back there, I would
2  suggest to you, based on this record, based on
3  Mr. Moyer's other health problems, I would
4  suggest --
5        Plaintiff's counsel, I think, asked for
6  $7.5 million and $10 million.  I would suggest
7  to you that an appropriate number in this case
8  would be not in the millions, it would be in
9  the thousands side.  And, so, that's within
10  your discretion, and I am --
11        Before somebody stands up and accuses me
12  of saying that these three ladies did not love
13  their father, that's not what I'm saying at
14  all.  Please understand, that's not what I'm
15  saying at all.  But I'm just trying to give you
16  a perspective on damages for -- if you get
17  there back in the jury room.
18        Again, it's been -- it's been a long
19  time, and so I really appreciate the time that
20  you've -- that you've spent.  I appreciate the
21  attention you've given to all of us.  I know we
22  appreciate that.
23        When it comes down to it, though, the
24  case really is about Mr. Moyer and the fact
25  that he was in control of his decisions, the

1  fact that he was in control of his decisions
2  whether to try to quit and how hard to try to
3  quit.
4        He quit for good in 2000.  If he would
5  have quit 10 years earlier, six years earlier,
6  from what Dr. Civantos said, things would have
7  been different.  Legal cause.
8        So, again, thank you so much for your
9  time.  Mr. Schlesinger is going to get up next.
10  I think yesterday he talked about unleashing
11  the demon, unleashing the demon of nicotine.
12        And, so, when he unleashes the demon
13  against the defense, just think to
14  yourselves -- because we can't respond -- what
15  would the defense say?  What would the defense
16  say to that?
17        And so, again, thank you very much.
18  That's all I have.
19        THE COURT:  Counsel, thank you.  Ladies
20  and gentlemen of the jury, we have the rebuttal
21  argument to continue with.  I know it's about
22  our lunchtime.  I would like to, if it's all
23  right --
24        I don't know if any of you are -- feel
25  famished and you need to take a break.  If you

1  do, we'll break.  Otherwise, I would like to
2  just finish it.
3        Mr. Schlesinger is going to go on for
4  about a half hour.  Is it all right if we
5  continue?
6        Yes?  Yes?
7        All right.  Counsel, thank you.
