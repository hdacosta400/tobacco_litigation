9       MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.  May it
10 please the Court.
11       Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
12       JURORS:  Good afternoon.
13       MR. HAMMER:  It's been a long road to get
14 here, and it's been a long time since Dale
15 first felt that first shortness of breath when
16 he was up there in North Carolina.
17       He climbed that hill in North Carolina,
18 felt shortness of breath, came home, went to
19 his doctor, Dr. Mascarenhas.  We heard from
20 him, read from his deposition.
21       And Dr. Mascarenhas, along with several
22 other doctors, determined that Dale had COPD
23 and determined that Dale had COPD caused from
24 his smoking.
25       For the doctors, you saw them testify,

1 all the doctors, all the records reflect, there
2 was really a no-brainer for the doctors.  He
3 had COPD, it was caused by his smoking.
4       All the doctors that testified in this
5 case all determined that he was addicted, too.
6 It was really a no-brainer for them.
7       Well, back 20 years ago, Dale had a
8 smoking-related disease, he was a smoker for a
9 long period of time.  And by virtue of those
10 facts alone, he was basically considered part
11 of the Engle class.
12       MR. BOYCE:  Objection.
13       THE COURT:  Excuse me.
14       Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is
15 closing argument.  This is plaintiff's
16 counsel's take on the evidence.
17       Thank you.
18       Objection noted.  Overruled.
19       MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.
20       As the Engle case wound its way through
21 the courts, it was tried and went up to the
22 Supreme Court.  You heard the Judge describe
23 that.
24       The Supreme Court said: We're going to
25 keep the findings.  You guys have all heard the

1 findings, and we're going to talk a lot about
2 the findings.
3       The individual smokers that are part of
4 the class get to file their own individual
5 suits.  So Dale Moyer did that.  He followed
6 the instructions of the Supreme Court, and here
7 we are.  His own individual suit.
8       Now, Dale was hoping to be around long
9 enough to meet the jury that was going to hear
10 his case.  We were fortunate enough to hear
11 from Dale.  You heard his testimony.  It was
12 played over the course of several hours, and
13 I'm going to talk about that a lot.  But,
14 unfortunately, Dale didn't make it.
15       So instead, his daughters Heather and
16 Lisa and Dawn, they're here, they took over his
17 case, and they proudly stand before you, as do
18 their lawyers, and we're making this argument
19 to you.
20       Now, Dale basically waited 20 years to
21 get into this class.  1994 is when he was
22 diagnosed.
23       Now it's your opportunity to put him
24 where he belongs.  That's all we're asking you
25 to do.

1       There are a couple simple questions that
2 are going to be asked with regard to that, and
3 that is, as the Judge read to you: Was smoking
4 cigarettes a legal cause of Dale Moyer's heart
5 disease?
6       Did Dale Moyer's COPD or emphysema first
7 manifest on or before November 21, 1996?
8       And was Dale Moyer addicted to cigarettes
9 containing nicotine?
10       And if so, was such addiction a legal
11 cause of his COPD or emphysema or heart
12 disease?
13       Now, Dale smoked cigarettes for a long
14 time.  Started out smoking these, Lucky
15 Strikes.
16       And he developed disease as a result.
17 Now, these cigarettes, unfiltered, as were the
18 Old Gold, as were the Chesterfield that he
19 smoked.
20       He smoked those for the first parts of
21 his life.  Started smoking when he was nine
22 years old.  Nine years old.
23       Now, I'm going to talk to you for a
24 little while about what the evidence showed,
25 and then Scott Schlesinger is going to stand up

1 and talk to you a lot about some of the conduct
2 that the tobacco companies displayed in this
3 case.
4       But I want to focus on Dale.
5       There's been a lot of talk in this case
6 about choice, a lot of talk about fault, a lot
7 of talk about failures to quit, a lot of talk
8 about the ability to quit.
9       But those are not really questions that
10 go to addiction.  Those are questions that
11 might go to the level of addiction.
12       But the question of whether or not Dale
13 was addicted, that's a pretty basic question.
14 And a lot of us, there's not going to be -- and
15 you heard -- the Judge gave you all the
16 instructions, and you've got the packet there.
17 You can look through that.  I think there's 32
18 pages.
19       You're not going to see one definition of
20 addiction.  So addiction is what you all say it
21 is.
22       Now, you've heard Dr. Seidman.  We
23 brought in Dr. Seidman, he's an addiction
24 specialist.  Works up there in Columbia,
25 teaches about addiction, teaches all the

1 doctors, he's an expert.
2       And he told you that based on his
3 analysis of the evidence in this case, based
4 upon his review of the documents in the case,
5 based upon his conversation with Dale -- he got
6 an opportunity to speak to Dale -- he
7 determined that Dale was one of the most severe
8 nicotine addicts he's ever dealt with.
9       And that's what is in these packages.
10 Nicotine.
11       Now, nicotine, as you learn, it naturally
12 occurs in the tobacco plant.  But the problem
13 is, the plant itself contains a certain amount
14 of nicotine, but the problem is that the
15 tobacco companies, they control the amount of
16 nicotine that goes in each one of these things.
17       And that's what is important.  Because
18 what they do is they control it to such an
19 extent that it keeps smokers addicted.  Gets
20 them addicted and keeps them addicted.
21       Now, Dale started smoking at nine years
22 old.  Remember the story he told?  It was in
23 his deposition how when he was nine, he and a
24 group of friends snuck a couple of Lucky
25 Strikes from his friend's dad's cigarette

1 stash, ran out to this makeshift fort.  It's
2 ironic, their makeshift fort was a coffin crate
3 that they built the fort up.
4       And that's, unfortunately, where Dale
5 ended up as a result of that first cigarette.
6       It led him on the path of addiction.
7 That's what these defendant companies count on.
8 They count on people like Dale, nine years old,
9 trying their first cigarette.
10       Some people try it, they don't like it.
11 Some people cough, they say oh, that stuff is
12 disgusting, I never want to do it again, but
13 some people continue doing it.
14       There's all sorts of reasons why people
15 smoke, initially at least.  They want to fit
16 if, it's peer pressure.  It's cool.  The ads
17 make it look cool.  At least they did back
18 then.  The movie stars, sports stars.  You've
19 seen the ads.
20       You'll see a lot during your closing
21 argument.  They make it look great.  They make
22 it look fun.  Alive with pleasure, lots of fun.
23       There's nothing pleasurable about what
24 Dale experienced at the end of his life as a
25 result of these things, and that's the harsh

1 reality of the cigarette.
2       It kills people.  It's a product, it's a
3 legal product, but it kills people, and they
4 know it.  And they've known it for a long time.
5 And that's the problem here.  And that's why
6 we're here before you.
7       Now, like I said, people smoke for
8 enjoyment, a whole lot of reasons.  But they
9 put the nicotine in here for one reason and one
10 reason only.  It's to keep people hooked.
11       Now, the choice of these defendants to
12 market tobacco known to be both addictive and
13 cancer causing -- we know that now.  We didn't
14 know it back in the '30s and '40s.  Dale sure
15 didn't know it as a nine-year-old boy.
16       It raises the question of fault.  Which
17 there's a section on the verdict form where you
18 determine the percentages of fault.
19       But, when it comes to that question --
20 and Mr. Schlesinger is going to address a lot
21 about that, he'll go into great detail about
22 the fault of the tobacco companies.
23       But right now, you want to talk more
24 about Dale.  The choice of a child like Dale to
25 start smoking these things, to try it and

1 become a regular smoker, buying packs of
2 cigarettes by age 14, that shouldn't be
3 considered by you as far as fault, but why he
4 started smoking in the first place.  Because of
5 what was out there.
6       But why aren't I talking about choices?
7 The choice he made when he was 14 to buy his
8 first pack.  It's because the tobacco companies
9 want to pretend that Dale wasn't addicted.
10 They want to pretend he wasn't addicted at all;
11 that his choices is what drove him.
12       If he was addicted, it was his choice to
13 continue to smoke long enough to get sick.
14 That's what they want to argue to you.  But
15 that's ridiculous.
16       There wasn't one piece of evidence that
17 was presented to you by either side that Dale
18 Moyer's addiction was his choice.  Nobody
19 chooses addiction.  Quite simply, nobody
20 chooses addiction.  Nobody wants to be
21 addicted.
22       It's often a terrible side effect of the
23 choice to smoke.  And just like the addiction
24 some people get from prescription pain
25 relievers, medicine, they get addicted.

1       But it frequently happens as an
2 unintended consequence of the use of the drug,
3 and the drug in this case is nicotine.
4       Lawful but dangerous drugs can have awful
5 side effects, side effects like addiction.  And
6 that's why people say, if you're taking that
7 medication, if you're smoking, be careful, you
8 might get hooked.
9       Why do people say that?  Because
10 addiction is just exactly that.  It's like a
11 fish getting hooked.  The fish chooses to
12 strike the bait.  And then gets caught by the
13 hidden hook.  The hook starts to pull the fish
14 along.  The fish starts fighting the hook and
15 tries to get off.
16       Some fish that were only, say, hooked
17 through the lip, they wiggle their way out of
18 the hook.  They are fortunate.
19       But the ones that are hooked all the way
20 through, those fish are goners.  That's what
21 it's all about.  Fishermen know that.  That's
22 why they use the hook.  That's why they use the
23 bait.  It covers the hook.
24       That's exactly what the tobacco companies
25 did.  No fisherman would ever say that the fish

1 was caught because the fish chose to get
2 hooked.  Of course not.  The fish died because
3 they didn't see the hook in the first place.
4       And Dale Moyer at nine years old and 14
5 and all those years, he didn't see the hook.
6       Dale was diagnosed with COPD, as I said,
7 in 1994, and he died a horrible death at age
8 84.  March 7th, 2013.
9       And it wasn't until six years after Dale
10 was diagnosed with COPD, in 2000s, that the
11 tobacco companies finally acknowledged, by
12 virtue of putting it up on their website, that
13 cigarettes are addictive and it causes disease.
14 That was their first true acknowledgment.
15       Certainly it was on the packs.  But you
16 know what?  There was never a warning about
17 addiction on any of the cigarette packs that
18 Dale Moyer smoked.  Never.
19       And there wasn't a warning about it being
20 harmful until 1966.  And that wasn't even a
21 warning, that was a caution.
22       Remember, we saw the different warnings
23 over the years.  Caution: Cigarettes may be
24 hazardous to your health.
25       By that time Dale was 37 years old, he

1 was already hooked.  He was already gone.  He
2 was already addicted.
3       But the interesting thing is, he did try
4 to get away many times over the years.  And you
5 heard about that.  But he was hooked.  And it
6 eventually killed him.
7       And that's the sad thing about this.
8 Now, the tobacco companies, they want to tell
9 you that being hooked had nothing to do with
10 Dale's death, had nothing to do with his
11 disease, nothing at all.  That's absurd.
12 That's crazy.
13       Dale Moyer chose to start smoking
14 cigarettes at nine years old.  That was his
15 choice.  A fatal choice in the end.
16       But you know what?  Nobody thinks when
17 they first try a cigarette when they're a kid,
18 nine, nine years old, ten years old, whatever
19 it may be, that they're going to be smoking for
20 the next 30, 40, 50, 60 years of their life.
21 Everybody thinks it's no big deal, I'll put it
22 down when I want.
23       Some people can't do that.  Dale
24 couldn't, and we heard how many times he tried.
25       You know, maybe you think Dale should

1 have tried harder.  Maybe.  But you heard how
2 many times he tried.  But that goes to fault.
3 Not to addiction.
4       So the first question in this case, the
5 threshold question we talked about, talks about
6 was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of Dale
7 Moyer's heart disease?
8       We heard doctors talk about the heart
9 disease.  It's really a no-brainer.  Cigarette
10 is the number one cause of heart disease in
11 this country.  And Dale had it.
12       Did Dale's COPD or emphysema manifest
13 itself before November 1996?  Well, of course.
14 It manifested itself when he was walking up
15 that hill and became short of breath.
16       So those questions should easily be
17 answered by you.
18       And was Dale addicted to the cigarettes
19 containing nicotine?  And if so, was such
20 addiction a legal cause of his COPD or heart
21 disease?  Yeah.
22       And those questions themselves are
23 answered yes, and they put him as a class
24 member, which is where he belongs.  It's as
25 simple as that.

1       Let's go to slide 149, please.
2       This is the question you're going to be
3 asked on the verdict form.  And it should
4 absolutely be checked off yes.
5       You're going to get a verdict form in
6 this case, and that's the main question: Is
7 Dale Moyer a class member?  Absolutely.
8       And we have to prove that to you by a
9 greater weight of the evidence.
10       Slide 3, please.
11       So we start out even.  We start out
12 balanced.  And then civil case law says we have
13 to prove it by the greater weight of the
14 evidence.  We have to tip the scales.
15       Now, in this case we believe we've
16 presented evidence of addiction, evidence of
17 cause of death, evidence of his disease,
18 evidence of his heart disease, COPD, the
19 emphysema, his cancer, linking all of it to
20 smoking cigarettes.
21       We believe we've presented evidence that
22 tips these scales quite a bit.  But really all
23 we need to do is tip it ever so slightly.
24 51 percent.
25       MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor,

1 misstates the burden of proof.
2       THE COURT:  Objection noted.  Overruled.
3       This is just argument.  The instructions
4 on the law that I gave you are controlling.
5 This is counsel's thoughts and comments about
6 it to persuade you to reach a verdict in this
7 case.
8       Proceed.
9       MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.
10       Now, in a case like this, you're the
11 jurors of the facts.  And we don't know what
12 you need to hear from us.  We present the
13 evidence as much as we possibly can and hope
14 that we give you enough evidence to convince
15 you.
16       And so we don't know how much to give
17 you, how little to give you, and we present a
18 lot of evidence.
19       Slide number 4, please.
20       There's some facts that are undisputed in
21 this case, and the Judge read them to you, and
22 clearly a lot of this evidence we presented
23 might have been repetitious, and we apologize
24 for that.
25       A lot of the evidence you say, well, we

1 already heard that, why are we hearing this
2 again.  And again I say, because we don't know
3 what you were expecting to hear from us.
4       We want to make sure we give you all the
5 evidence you need to make a proper decision in
6 this case, and I apologize to you if we did get
7 repetitive.
8       Now, in the next hour or so, Scott and I,
9 we're going to go through the evidence, but
10 before I do that, I want to -- I actually want
11 to talk about a very important legal principle,
12 and that is addiction as a legal cause.
13 Because the Judge read to you that, and it's in
14 your packet quite a bit.
15       You know, generally, as I said, you get a
16 definition of everything, but you don't get a
17 definition of addiction.  So you all use your
18 judgment about what addiction is and whether or
19 not Dale Moyer was addicted to the nicotine in
20 cigarettes.  It really should be a no-brainer,
21 and all the witnesses say he was.
22       And if you think about -- if you think,
23 you know somebody that smokes a pack or two or
24 three packs of cigarettes a day for 60 years,
25 if you think that in and of itself is enough

1 for addiction and that meets your definition,
2 that's enough.
3       If you think you need more, that's fine
4 too.
5       But, you know, a person doesn't smoke
6 three packs a day for 60 years because they
7 like the taste.  They don't smoke three packs a
8 day because they want to hang out with their
9 friends smoking.  They smoke three packs a day
10 because they're addicted to the nicotine.  They
11 need the nicotine.
12        And you heard how Dale described how
13 much he needed it.
14       Slide 16, please.
15       Slide 16 talks about addiction being a
16 legal cause of injury if it directly in a
17 natural and continuous sequence produces or
18 contributes substantially to produce the injury
19 so that it can reasonably be said that but for
20 the addiction to the cigarettes containing that
21 nicotine, the injury would not have occurred.
22       So what that's saying is, did the
23 addiction, his continued smoking, his
24 dependence on the nicotine, did it contribute
25 substantially to producing his injuries?

1       Of course it did.  That's a question
2 you'll have to answer, but I think we presented
3 enough evidence for you to answer yes.
4       And you're also told in the packet, it
5 talks about in order for it to be regarded as a
6 legal cause of injury, addiction need not be
7 the only cause.
8       And so we -- I don't want you to get
9 confused that -- when we talk about cause of
10 injury, it could be in combination with other
11 things, and that's what is explained to you in
12 the packet.  It's a legal cause.  One of the
13 causes.
14       And so you're given an instruction also
15 on intervening cause.  And I would ask you to
16 go back there in the jury room, look at those
17 instructions, because it's important.  Because
18 it says it may also be a legal cause of heart
19 disease or COPD or emphysema or cancer, even
20 though it operates in combination with some
21 other natural cause or some other cause
22 occurring after the addiction to the cigarettes
23 containing nicotine in combination with it.
24 And contributes substantially.
25       That means did the addiction to nicotine

1 play an important role.  That's really what
2 that means.
3       Did it play an important role in
4 contributing to him getting those diseases?
5       Of course.  Of course it did.  Because
6 that's what caused him to continue smoking.  If
7 he wasn't addicted, he wouldn't have continued
8 to smoke those cigarettes.
9       Those cigarettes contained the toxins,
10 bathed his lungs every day, caused lung damage,
11 COPD and emphysema, caused lung cancer, and
12 caused heart disease.  And also, we allege,
13 parotid cancer.
14       Now, addiction must be a factor that
15 comes into play.  His choices to smoke, and
16 maybe you think, you know, well, part of it was
17 his choice.  And that's fine.
18       But part of it was his addiction that
19 drove him to smoke.  Part of it might have been
20 his failure to quit, had he quit earlier.  But
21 part of it also was driving his addiction.
22       So it could be part and parcel of why he
23 continued to smoke.  But addiction certainly
24 was the substantial reason why he continued.
25       And that's what the legal cause means.

1 It can get confusing, because it's a bunch of
2 pages in there.  A bunch of legal mumbo jumbo.
3 It gets confusing.
4       In fact, there's one paragraph that's
5 about 12 lines long, and it doesn't even have a
6 period.  It's all run-on sentence, and a
7 grammar teacher would probably give us an F for
8 that.  The fact of the matter is, it does get
9 confusing.  But I'm trying to simplify it for
10 you.
11       The question is, as we have down there:
12 If he was not addicted to nicotine, would he
13 have smoked two or three packs a day every day
14 for 60 years?
15       That's where you have to use your common
16 sense.  The common sense would tell you that it
17 was the nicotine that drove him to do that.
18 There might have been other things too, but it
19 was definitely the nicotine that was a
20 substantial factor.
21       Now, I want to talk a little bit about
22 Dale.  And as I said, Scott is going to talk
23 about the tobacco companies and their conduct.
24       I want to talk about Dale.  Because this
25 case is about Dale Moyer and his family, and

1 what he meant to them.
2       I want to put up photo number 102,
3 please.
4       You know, we all heard how much Dale
5 loved life.  The guy, he was always the ball of
6 fire at the parties, at the family gatherings,
7 at the occasions.  They loved him down at the
8 merchandise mart.
9       This is Dale when he was just a little
10 kid.  He was born in 1929, he grew up in
11 Pennsylvania.  His father was a minister.  And
12 through his dad, through that family
13 background, he instilled a lot of values in
14 Dale.  And Dale instilled those values in Dawn
15 and Lisa and Heather.  You know?
16       That's important.  That's an important
17 consideration.  We're going to be asking you to
18 give us money for their pain and suffering.
19 For Dale's pain and suffering.
20       Number 104.
21       Here is a picture of Dale right about the
22 time -- he was probably about six or seven,
23 eight.  Just shortly after this, he tried his
24 first cigarette.  Nine years old.
25       Number 112.

1       And we heard from Dale that he loved
2 music, he loved to sing.  He was in the
3 barbershop quartet.  We saw this picture
4 already.
5       Remember Dale talked about in his
6 deposition that was played for you all, he
7 talked about listening to the radio, watching
8 TV, listening to the music shows.  He talked
9 about watching Bandstand.
10       It was actually called the Lucky Strike
11 Hit Parade, sponsored by Lucky Strike
12 cigarettes.  As were all the TV shows back
13 then.
14       We saw some of them.  Even the
15 Flintstones, the TV cartoon sponsored by
16 Winston.
17       So it shouldn't surprise you to learn
18 that when Dale is listening to Lucky Strike and
19 he tries his first Lucky Strike, he continues
20 to smoke Lucky Strike, along with Old Gold and
21 Chesterfield.
22       But he smokes Lucky Strike.  Why?  It was
23 the popular cigarette.  It was what he listened
24 to on the radio, Lucky Strike Hit Parade, and
25 it kept him going with the nicotine.

1       And he also smoked the Old Gold, and he
2 also smoked -- excuse me, the Chesterfields.
3       Remember we heard about the fact that he
4 joined the Army.
5       Let's look at photo -- actually, before
6 we go there, let's go to photo 016, please.
7       He loved -- I'm sorry, not that one.
8 Take that down.  Go to 107.  I apologize.
9       He joined the Army, and he became a
10 paratrooper.  Army airborne.  That is the elite
11 of the Army, so they say.  I don't want to
12 offend anybody that might be part of the other
13 branch.  But Army airborne is the elite.  He
14 joined it, he volunteered for it.  He joked
15 around, yeah, they paid more money.
16       But, you know, he joined it.  He
17 volunteered for it.  And he was proud of that.
18 He was proud of that.  And well he should be.
19       And while he was in the Army, he got
20 hurt.  And he told the story that while he was
21 in the hospital laid up for three months, they
22 were handing out free cigarettes.
23 Chesterfield, a Liggett product.  Lucky Strike,
24 an R.J. Reynolds product.  And Old Gold, a
25 Lorillard product.

1       And that's what he basically started
2 smoking on.  An R.J. Reynolds product.  Lucky
3 Strike, Old Gold, and Chesterfield.  And that's
4 what created that addiction.  Those cigarettes
5 together.
6       One cigarette after the other, until
7 eventually he started smoking packs, buying
8 packs at age 14, in the Army, smoking a pack or
9 two a day.  And he was getting them for free.
10 That's what created that addiction.
11       And so R.J. Reynolds from Lucky Strike,
12 Liggett for Chesterfield, and Lorillard for Old
13 Gold, they all helped create that addiction in
14 Dale Moyer.  And they're all to blame for that.
15       Go to photo number 68, please.  068.
16       He got married to Corinne, we heard about
17 that.  We heard about his wife.  And shortly
18 after, a few years after they got married in
19 1955, she got polio.  She had a child Dane, who
20 has now since passed away, and they had three
21 beautiful daughters that you all heard and got
22 to meet.  And heard about their life and how
23 Dale affected their life.
24        But they learned from Dale to put family
25 first.  That's what he always did.  It's

1 important to him.  And it's been important to
2 these girls.  That's what he instilled in these
3 girls.
4       You heard about how their family was
5 important to them.  You heard about how
6 important all the events were for Dale.
7       Photo 061, please.
8       Went to their softball games.  You heard
9 about how he went to all their softball games.
10 He was smoking all the time.
11       Photo 045 and 047, 115, and 116.
12       Birthday parties, so important to the
13 family.  They always got together.  And going
14 to church together.  Always important to them.
15 And they went every Sunday.
16       Family was so important to Dale Moyer.
17 And yet, he left his wife after a while for a
18 number of years, and we heard about the fact
19 that he had a relationship with Irma and with
20 Loretta.
21       But he never actually left his family.
22 He left the house, but never left his family.
23 And that's important.  Because these girls were
24 his world, Heather, Dawn and Lisa.  They were
25 his world.

1       And he made it a point to come home, go
2 to church with them on Sundays.  He made it a
3 point to come home for their birthday parties.
4 He made it a point to remain a family.  Even
5 though he wasn't living in the family home.
6       That's pretty unique.  That's an
7 impressive type of guy.
8       That shows how important family was to
9 him.  And it shows how important these girls
10 were.
11       So he switched -- and he started
12 smoking -- he smoked those brands, and then he
13 switched to Kents because he believed what the
14 tobacco companies said, that they were safer.
15 And he smoked those for 20 years until he
16 switched to Salem menthols and then Salem
17 lights.  Based upon the health assurances by
18 these tobacco companies.
19       And it only -- slide number 2, please.
20       These are the brands he smoked.  And
21 you'll see R.J. Reynolds makes Lucky Strike.
22 Liggett makes Chesterfield.  Lorillard, Old
23 Gold.  Lorillard made Kent.
24       He switched to Kent and then switched to
25 Salems in the later years, R.J. Reynolds

1        products.
2              And you heard it from Dale's mouth about
3        how addicted he was.
4              Number 21.
5 6 7              follows:)
8        Q.    Was there ever a point in time as you sit
9 here today that you recall that you actually did enjoy
10 smoking?
11        A.    It's a really hard line between, you
12 know, enjoy, and I came to realize that I had to
13 smoke.  I mean, that's -- I wanted to quit.  There was
14 a hassle.  It was expensive, it was dirty, it was a
15 filthy habit, and all my family didn't like it, and I
16 didn't like it, and I wanted very much to quit.  But I
17 was smoking because I was addicted to cigarettes.
18              (Video clip concluded.)
19              MR. HAMMER:  Put up slide number 20,
20        please.
21              And we heard the evidence in the case.
22        He chain smoked.  He smoked first thing in the
23        morning, last thing before bed.  He burnt the
24        couches and sofas with cigarette ashes.  He
25        smoked after he was diagnosed with the various

1        diseases.  He was never without a cigarette.
2              When he was, he was nervous, he was
3        agitated.  He was uptight, angry, edgy; all
4        withdrawal symptoms.
5              And we heard -- number 22, please -- all
6        the evidence in the case, all the witnesses.
7        Every single witness that was actually called
8        and even the witnesses that the defense called.
9        Larry Moyer, his brother, and Loretta Hedberg,
10        which they read their depositions in.  They all
11        said he was addicted.
12              And what did we hear from the defense?
13        Absolutely nothing.  They didn't present any
14        evidence to the contrary.  Dale Moyer was
15        absolutely addicted to the nicotine in
16        cigarettes.  No question about it.
17              And you heard that he tried to quit many
18        times.
19              Let's do slide 19, please.
20              He tried all sorts of things: Patches,
21        Nicorette gum, Habitrol, hypnosis, cutting
22        down, throwing away cigarettes, lighters, his
23        ashtrays.  Throwing them out the car window.
24              And he finally quit with Zyban, a
25        prescription drug.  Thank goodness.  He needed

1        Zyban to quit.  Thank goodness that came
2        around.
3              And the two witnesses that the defense
4        put on, Larry and Loretta.  Loretta said
5        certainly his behavior was not of a person who
6        couldn't do without his ciggies.  Remember she
7        said that?  That he smoked a lot, and
8        consistently.
9              And Larry testified: We all encouraged
10        Dale to smoke (sic) over the years, as early as
11        the '70s.
12              And he said -- he said: I don't know if
13        my brother ever used the word "addicted," but
14        that's basically what his problem was.  He
15        couldn't quit.
16              And he said he made several attempts.  He
17        was making an effort.  And he even said when
18        something would be introduced on the market, he
19        would try it.  That's what Larry told us, his
20        own brother.
21              And Larry made it clear that he believed
22        Dale smoked because he believed him to be
23        addicted, and it was his opinion that Dale was
24        addicted to cigarettes because, quote, "Given
25        the difficulty he had with giving them up, I

1        know from public awareness and public knowledge
2        that cigarettes are addictive, and he's a
3        lifelong smoker.  Put the two together."
4              That's what Larry responded to questions
5        asked by the defense.
6              Remember that testimony?  Basically a
7        no-brainer, put it together.  He was addicted.
8        Of course.
9              Now, we heard discussions about Dale's
10        sickness and you saw him testify.  And you saw
11        and we talked about the fact that he finally
12        quit with Zyban.  But unfortunately for Dale,
13        it was too late.
14              Slide 34.
15              The disease process that had gotten so
16        far advanced as a result of his addiction that
17        he couldn't breathe without the aid of oxygen.
18              These are some of the medical records
19        that talk about just how bad his COPD had
20        gotten, that he needed 24-hour oxygen.  He
21        became a respiratory cripple, and eventually
22        the end-stage COPD literally took his breath
23        away, and he died.
24              Now, you saw the death certificate and
25        you saw -- there was discussion about how it

1        was amended to reflect the proper reason why he
2        died.  He died from the COPD.
3              And you heard Lisa and Heather and Dawn
4        talk about what their father meant.  We're not
5        here looking for sympathy.  We're not here
6        asking you to feel sorry for Heather or Lisa or
7        Dawn, even Dale.  We're asking you for justice.
8        We're asking for justice.
9              You can put that down.
10              You know, fortunately, Dawn and Lisa and
11        Heather, they've got each other, and they
12        turned to each other when Dale passed away, and
13        they turned to each other to grieve, and
14        they've been here for each other every day.
15        And they will continue to be here for each
16        other.  But they lost their father.
17              And, you know, it was asked a lot of
18        times: Well, how old were you when your father
19        passed away?
20              And each of them were in their 50s.  It
21        was only last year.
22              And how old was Dale when he passed away.
23        They kept making a point that Dale was 84 years
24        old, as if, hey, he lived long enough.  That's
25        the point they were trying to make.  And, hey,

1        you're 50 years old.  You know, you had enough
2        time with your father.
3              There's never enough time.  Because when
4        Dale was 84, last year, they were looking
5        forward to spending his 85th birthday with him
6        in June of this year, as opposed to preparing
7        for this trial.  That's what they were looking
8        forward to, but he never made it.
9              And they were looking forward to having a
10        90th birthday with him.  And you heard what the
11        table said, 6.7 years.  He could have lived
12        until 90.
13              But that's taken away from them.  And
14        it's taken away from them because of what
15        cigarettes did to him.  And that's why we're
16        here.
17              Now, the verdict form I want to go
18        through very quickly with you.
19              Can we turn this on?
20              TECHNICIAN:  Sure.
21              MR. HAMMER:  I already talked about these
22        questions.  These are the class membership
23        questions.
24              Was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of
25        Dale Moyer's heart disease?  Of course.

1              Did Dale Moyer's COPD or emphysema first
2        manifest on or before November 21, 1996?  Of
3        course it did.  That was back in '93, '94, when
4        he was diagnosed.
5              Was he addicted to cigarettes containing
6        nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal
7        cause of his COPD or emphysema or heart
8        disease?  Of course.
9              Those are the threshold questions to make
10        him a class member.  That's why we're here.
11              The next page is going to have -- there's
12        a question: Did Dale Moyer have primary parotid
13        cancer?  And you heard evidence about that.
14        You heard evidence from the defense who called
15        their only medical expert, a doctor who said
16        no, that was skin cancer.
17              Well, you also heard from Dr. -- from --
18        name escapes me.
19              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Policzer.
20              MR. HAMMER:  Policzer.  Thank you, Scott.
21              From Dr. Policzer.  He said based on his
22        experience, he's an oncologist, that parotid
23        cancer was basically caused by smoking.  That's
24        for you to determine.
25              We think we've submitted sufficient

1        evidence to show by a greater weight of the
2        evidence that parotid cancer was caused by
3        smoking, and that he had primary parotid
4        cancer.
5              Now, did the cigarettes that these
6        defendants made, Lucky Strikes, Chesterfields,
7        the Old Gold, the Kents, the Salems, did they
8        cause Dale's smoking-related illnesses?  Of
9        course they did.  No question about it.  So you
10        should check off yes there.
11              The next question, percentage of fault.
12        And that's something you'll need to think about
13        yourselves.  But Dale accepted fault for his
14        smoking, for his inability to quit, perhaps.
15              But think about Dale's choices and then
16        think about the tobacco company's choices that
17        they made.
18              THE COURT:  Five minutes, Counsel.
19              MR. HAMMER:  I would suggest to you,
20        since he smoked Reynolds products and Lorillard
21        products for most of his life, the Kent, Lucky
22        Strike, Salems, they are 40 percent.  Liggett
23        is 15, and Dale is 5.
24              Did he reasonably rely on these
25        statements that were made?  Well, he certainly

1        switched to Kent filters based on their
2        assurances, health assurances.
3              He certainly switched to Salems after
4        '82.  So he relied before and after '82.
5              So these questions should be absolutely
6        checked off yes all the way down, because he
7        relied on what these companies said about their
8        health effects, health reassurances.
9              I know I'm going through this fast, but I
10        want to get to this part.  And that is: Were --
11        were Dale's smoking-related diseases a legal
12        cause of his death?
13              And we say that as a result of the
14        parotid cancer, which we say was caused by
15        smoking, and the COPD that prevented him from
16        having the surgery to remove the parotid
17        cancer, that led to his death.  So we say yes.
18              So, therefore, Heather and Dawn and Lisa
19        should be entitled to compensation for the loss
20        of their father.
21              And how do you put a dollar figure on
22        somebody's life?  How do you do that?  Because
23        it's not going to bring them back.
24              But you talk in the only way that we can,
25        and that's money.

1              I would suggest to you that $2.5 million
2        is fair and just compensation to each of these
3        girls for the loss of their father.  And that
4        the medical expenses that were incurred, we
5        heard was $373,436.55.  And then you total that
6        up, and that would be 7.873,436.
7              But if you don't think -- if you don't
8        think that cigarette smoking, his addiction
9        caused his death, but rather something else
10        did.  If you believe it was all the skin cancer
11        that they're talking about, we'll accept that.
12        We'll respect that.  And if that's the case,
13        you go to Dale Moyer's suffering.
14              And how do you compensate Dale?  He's
15        dead.  But how about those years he went
16        through, 20 years, 1994 until just last year
17        when he died, of gasping for air, gradually
18        getting worse over the years, where it got to
19        be that he was on 24/7 oxygen.
20              Now, you saw him.  He testified.  You saw
21        him testify five different days.  November 18
22        into December, December 5th and 6th, and into
23        January, and then he testified March 7th, 2012.
24        A year before he died.  Exactly a year.
25              So you got to see what he looked like

1        over a period of time.  You saw from that short
2        period of time, he declined quite a bit.
3              But then we got a year later in January
4        and had the day in the life video you saw.  You
5        saw how much worse he was.
6              That's what Dale Moyer was going through
7        every day.  Gasping for air.  How do you
8        compensate somebody for that?
9              He didn't choose that.  Nobody chooses
10        that.
11              We think fair and just compensation to
12        Dale would be $10 million.
13              That's fair for what he suffered through
14        on a daily basis for nearly 20 years.  That's
15        certainly fair.
16              And you may think that's too much.  You
17        may think it's not enough.  That's totally your
18        province, your decision.  And we respect
19        whatever decision you might make.
20              And, of course, the medical bills again
21        were $373,436.55, for a total of 10,373,436.55.
22              Now, Scott is going to talk to you about
23        punitive damages and why they should be
24        punished.  But I think after he talks to you,
25        you all will feel comfortable in saying yes,

1        they do -- these companies do deserve to be
2        punished for what they did and continue to do
3        today.
4              Thank you.


25              MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the

1        Court, counsel, ladies and gentlemen.
2              I talk faster than Steve Hammer, and I've
3        got a lot more to cover.  So I'll try to let it
4        come out.  Some of it will wash over you, but
5        I'll go as fast as I can.
6              I'll go to the first slide.
7              Dale Moyer never knew that cigarettes
8        contained paint stripper, welding torch
9        chemicals, ant poison, napalm, lighter fluid,
10        car batteries, car exhaustion, insecticide,
11        embalming fluid, and so on and so forth.
12        Polonium 210 used in nuclear weapons, rocket
13        fuel, things like that.  He never knew that.
14              So you know, today you have in evidence
15        in this case these documents, including this
16        document right here.  This is the latest
17        Surgeon General report.  This is from 2014.  It
18        came out into evidence, it came out in the
19        public in January of 2014.
20              Every two years, they put one out.  So
21        this is current information.  You have the last
22        four years: 2010, 2012, and 2014.
23              And in the most recent order of things
24        that are important to know what's happening in
25        this country with regard to cigarette smoking,

1        when this group, the Surgeon General, the chief
2        medical officer of the United States, who is
3        the one who is in charge of looking after the
4        public health, wants to tell you what the
5        current status of information that you need to
6        know, he says in his major conclusion of the
7        report, on page 6 of that report in evidence --
8        Page 7, excuse me.
9              You can write these down.  You're going
10        to have them.  You can see them.  If you want
11        to write them down, you can see them.
12              This is the conclusion: The tobacco
13        epidemic was initiated and has been sustained
14        by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco
15        industry, which has deliberately misled the
16        public on the risks of smoking cigarettes.
17              That's current information as of today.
18              So that our research, our understanding,
19        the Surgeon General's 2010 report, the Surgeon
20        General's 2012 report, the entire report is
21        about teen smoking.
22              What is smoking?  Smoking is drug
23        addiction.  Pure and simple.  It's hard to wrap
24        your minds around it, but that's all it is.
25              What has it been since tobacco has begun,

1        the inhalation process to unleash the demon of
2        deep addiction?  That's all it's ever been.
3        They know it.  That's what they sell.
4              The epidemic of addiction-driven disease
5        is what we have in this country today
6        unchanged.
7              His Honor talked about are you going to
8        punish them?  Well, you can consider mitigation
9        if you punish them, meaning what have they done
10        different?
11              What have they done different?  Nothing.
12        The Surgeon General's report as of the last few
13        months says as a scientific conclusion: That
14        this epidemic that we have in our country of
15        losing a half a million people a year, over
16        1200 people a day, 20 million people since
17        1964, that these deaths, these scourges, these
18        unnecessary deaths have all been because of an
19        industry that initiated and sustained
20        aggressive strategies and deliberately misled
21        the product -- the public on the risks of
22        smoking cigarettes.
23              Now, let's go to -- I'm going to start
24        with 6 and then I'm going to click.  Okay?
25              Okay.  So this is addiction causation.

1        We're going to talk about that real briefly.
2        This is just 2004, nicotine addiction leads
3        directly to cancer through a bunch of
4        biological pathways.
5              Question 1.  Addiction drives smoking.
6        Addiction is the center of the universe of the
7        tobacco business.  Of course that's how you get
8        diseases.  You get it from smoking.  Don't
9        forget class membership --
10              Is this going to work -- do I have the
11        clicker?
12              TECHNICIAN:  Yes.
13              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Class membership, this
14        is important, is not about the fault of either
15        party, the reliance on statements from the
16        tobacco industry, whether addicts lose total
17        control over their minds, and whether addicts
18        can quit.  That is not what class membership is
19        about.
20              Where am I supposed to point this to get
21        it to work?
22              TECHNICIAN:  You should be able to click
23        it.
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Was that me or you?
25              TECHNICIAN:  That was me.

1              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Is this thing working
2        or not?  I've got no time to waste.  Heck.
3              TECHNICIAN:  You accidentally turned it
4        off.  It's on.
5              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
6              Very simply this.  Addiction to nicotine.
7        A legal cause of smoking leading to COPD, heart
8        disease, lung cancer.  And as Dr. Policzer
9        said, head and neck cancer, parotid cancer.
10        You heard about that.
11              It's an epidemic of addiction-driven
12        disease and death.
13              How do we know that?  If you go to this
14        book here, the authoritative, definitive
15        reference, the admitted in evidence because of
16        its validity to you in your decision making,
17        the bottom line is that nicotine addiction is
18        the fundamental reason that folks persist in
19        using tobacco products, and that persistent use
20        contributes to many of the diseases described
21        in this report.
22              Addiction leads to disease.  They said it
23        in 2004 in the Surgeon General's report.  They
24        say it here on page 77: Nicotine maintains the
25        addiction and thereby leads to ongoing

1        exposures of smokers to come up with compounds
2        with known adverse effects.
3              And what do the tobacco companies know in
4        this unbelievable conspiracy and fraud that
5        took 50 years by an industry that utterly lost
6        its moral compass, that acted utterly --
7              MR. BOYCE:  Objection.  Morality,
8        Your Honor.
9              THE COURT:  I'm sorry, Counsel?
10              MR. BOYCE:  Objection to the reference of
11        morals.
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  In the Supreme Court
13        opinion.
14              THE COURT:  Objection noted.  Overruled.
15              This is argument.  Proceed.
16              MR. SCHLESINGER:  When we ask you to get
17        through compensatory damages, that's
18        restorative damages for the family members, the
19        conduit to punitive damages, a call for you to
20        look at this as an expression of moral
21        condemnation.
22              It calls for a day of reckoning, a time
23        where there is a punishment for past misdeeds,
24        so a tobacco industry wants them -- they have
25        an instruction and they want to be considered

1        as people.  They have the rights of people, and
2        we agree.  They have the rights of people.
3              And we agree, they have the rights of
4        people.
5              Well, you know what comes the rights of
6        personhood and humanity?  The responsibilities
7        of personhood and humanity.  Which means, be
8        decent.  Act decently to one another.  You do
9        not trade lives for money.  You do not act
10        where unmitigated greed takes over and somebody
11        embarks upon a plan where they will addict
12        children, hook them for life, kill them and
13        replace them with more children?
14              MR. WOODS:  Objection.
15              MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's the business in
16        this country?
17              THE COURT:  Take it down a notch,
18        Counsel.
19              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.  Sorry.
20              I'll speed it up, but I won't get too
21        fired up.
22              That's not an appropriate business model
23        in this country, and that's their model.  Lure,
24        entice, addict.  Turn your addicted customer
25        into a cash flow for a period of time.  And

1        when they meet the demise that you fully know
2        they will, replace them with more youth and
3        children.
4              That's not a business model.  They say
5        it's a legal product.  It is a legal product.
6        But it isn't legal to sell it to minors.  And
7        the entire basis of the business is minors.
8              The Surgeon General 2012 again, even now,
9        even in 2012, even this recently, we have to
10        have the Surgeon General putting out reports
11        saying we've got to do something about youth
12        initiation.
13              All smoking.  It's right in the preface
14        of this document.  All smoking begins in youth
15        and adolescents.
16              If you took away cigarette smoking from
17        anyone under 21 years old, if no one under 21
18        years old could get a cigarette, cigarette
19        smoking would go down 90 percent in this
20        country.  90 percent in this country.
21              They would still have a business.
22        Instead of making the money they are making,
23        they would make less.  But it still would be a
24        going business.  That's a very important thing
25        to consider.

1              Everything here.  They say it's a rat in
2        the cage.  They compare their customers to a
3        rat in the cage.  They humanize themselves.
4        They talk about the health of their country --
5        of their company.  The health of their profits.
6              They are giving birth to new smokers.
7        The language of anthropomorphizing
8        characteristics to themselves where they
9        describe their customers as rats in a cage.
10        There is even a document there where they talk
11        about the crop of new youth.
12              This is the kind of language they've used
13        over the years in secret documents that nobody
14        ever thought would see the light of day.
15              No one has ever become a cigarette smoker
16        by smoking cigarettes without nicotine, and
17        very few consumers are aware of the effects of
18        nicotine.
19              Do you think that my client, Dale Moyer,
20        ever had any idea when he was nine years old
21        what was getting himself into?
22              You want to know about, did they
23        contribute to cause by managing the information
24        environment and getting folks to think that
25        they were having a good time and having

1        satisfaction that Mr. Moyer had any long-range
2        understanding of what he was getting himself
3        into?
4              Remember, they said $250,000 billion
5        dollars -- no -- $250 billion on advertising.
6        If they had spent $250 billion telling the
7        truth, would my client have been a long-term
8        smoker and gotten sick?
9              They said they would go out of business
10        if it was ever proven that this was a dangerous
11        commodity that they were selling, this tobacco.
12              If they had told the truth and stopped
13        making it, would my client have died from any
14        cigarette-related diseases?  Absolutely not.
15              Would he have been sickened to the point
16        where his life deteriorated in the last 20
17        years?  He was only in his 60s when he got
18        sick, and solely but surely began gasping for
19        air.
20              Did my client know that there's over 70
21        carcinogens, and over half of all smokers die
22        from tobacco-related disease?  And as the
23        current Surgeon General's report says, 480,000
24        a year dying, 20 million, 1200 a day.
25              One of the things you will learn when we

1        read about this, and you'll see it in these
2        reports.  I encourage you to look at them as
3        you think about this.
4              The numbers numb.  They are so huge.  If
5        we have a tragedy that makes it on to the
6        evening news and a few people get hurt or there
7        is a bad killing abroad or something and
8        several people get hurt, people know about
9        that.  It's evening news.
10              And yet this is a tragedy.  This is an
11        irrational madness that hides in plain sight.
12        We have this scourge living in our country that
13        happens every single day.  Over 1300 people are
14        dying, 20 million have died, even since the
15        1964 Surgeon General report.  Doesn't make
16        sense, but it's happening right under our nose.
17              Everything the Surgeon General explains
18        is there is no free choice in smoking.  And
19        that is the tautology, that is the logical
20        thing that you must take into consideration.
21              I don't know that the defendants are
22        always being anything but a little hypocritical
23        about it --
24              MR. WOODS:  Objection.
25              MS. RUIZ:  Objection.

1              THE COURT:  Sustained.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  You don't have a choice
3        when it comes to smoking.  It's not a matter of
4        free choice.
5              Kids can't make long-range plans.  Their
6        brains are developing.  They don't know where
7        they are.  They don't know what they're getting
8        themselves into.
9              Here is what they say in their own
10        internal documents.  You remember Shook Hardy,
11        the lawyer that hired the pathologist that came
12        to testify.  That's a law firm.
13              MR. WOODS:  Objection, Your Honor.
14              THE COURT:  I overruled the objection.
15              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Right here.  Right
16        here, internal secret document.  We got these
17        documents in the year 2000.  We have the goods
18        on them now.  Smoking is going down as we learn
19        more.
20              These books are full of research.  What
21        we're learning from what tobacco knew all
22        along.  They were light years ahead.  They were
23        light years ahead of the public health
24        community.  They knew more about nicotine.
25        They knew more about cancer.  They knew more

1        about those filters that didn't work.  They
2        knew that the light cigarettes didn't work.
3        They beat the FTC machine.
4              That's in this book right here, the
5        National Cancer Institute book number 13.  Read
6        the pages from 200 to 233, and you'll see what
7        a fraud it was that filters and lights would
8        reassure the health.
9              And what do they do now?  What has
10        changed?  Has anything at all changed?  Now
11        they have American Spirit.  Today.  Right now.
12        American Spirit.  100 percent additive free
13        organic tobacco.
14              In our modern world in the year 2014,
15        what do we think when we hear "organic, 100
16        percent additive free"?
17              Oh, by the way, with menthol, which we
18        know in this book makes cigarettes more
19        addictive, one-third of all sales of cigarettes
20        are menthol.  The FDA is considering banning
21        menthol, and Dr. Proctor testified --
22              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor,
23        further TPSAC report.
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm not talking about
25        the TPSAC report.

1              MR. BOYCE:  Move to strike.
2              THE COURT:  Counsel.
3              You are to rely on your own recollection
4        of the evidence.  Thank you.
5              Proceed.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.
7              Menthol makes cigarettes more addictive.
8        One-third of cigarettes are menthol.
9              Dr. Proctor testified it makes it more
10        addictive.  He talked about it.
11              Mr. Moyer was a smoker of menthol.
12        Thought they would be better for him.  Like he
13        thought the lights would be better for him.
14        Like he thought the filters would be better for
15        him.
16              He smoked Kents.  Kents were a health
17        reassurance brand.  They had the American
18        Medical Association advertising, the Journal of
19        the American Medical Association advertising
20        how smart people and scientific it was to have
21        this Micronite filter.
22              And Dale Moyer jumped all over that, and
23        he testified that was part of the reason why he
24        continued to smoke.
25              And that was what they were planning.  He

1        fit their -- he fit their marketing plan to a
2        tee.
3              There is the simple truth.  Do we have
4        to -- does it take more than that?  It doesn't.
5        It doesn't take more than that.  But this looks
6        like a consumer product.  It's invisible to
7        people who don't notice it, but it's just
8        sitting back behind the counter there.
9              But that's the simple truth.  He did
10        that.  I did that.  Dale smoked a million
11        cigarettes.  A million cigarettes.  Nobody
12        smokes a million cigarettes except for the
13        compulsive use of a drug.  Eight puffs of
14        cigarette, 8 million direct hits of nicotine to
15        the brain.
16              This is the chain -- you played this,
17        right?
18              TECHNICIAN:  Yes.
19              MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is heart disease.
20        Very interesting about the heart disease.
21        There's no doubt that he had a manifestation of
22        heart disease before 1996.
23              For class membership, I'm doing it real
24        quick.  ASCVD, that's atherosclerotic vascular
25        disease.  And the fact is, you're not going to

1        be asked a question about manifestation.  He
2        had cigarette -- he had a heart disease before
3        '96.
4              That's not in dispute.  That's one of the
5        things that should be not in dispute.  But what
6        you do have to figure out is whether or not the
7        heart disease was caused from smoking.
8              Here is what we know about it.  I'm going
9        to do it quick.
10              Mascarenhas and Civantos both testify
11        about it.  Civantos came in here.  This guy was
12        a top doc.  And I know you know it, because
13        that man was a professor, he was credentialed.
14        He was a scholar.  I hope you found him
15        credible.  He appeared to be.
16              He said within a reasonable degree of
17        medical probability, smoking was a substantial
18        contributing cause to Dale Moyer's heart
19        disease.
20              All by itself, if that's true, and
21        addiction leads to heart disease, which it's
22        the number one cause of heart disease, he's a
23        class member just on the heart disease.
24              And Mascarenhas said it too.  But
25        Mascarenhas said it's the number one cause

1        factor.  And he said as the number one cause
2        factor, it acts in combination with whatever
3        other cause factors the defendants were trying
4        to establish.
5              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, misstates the
6        evidence.  Misstates Dr. Mascarenhas's
7        testimony.
8              THE COURT:  Excuse me.
9              Ladies and gentlemen, rely on your own
10        recollection of the evidence.
11              Counsel.
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  We'll come -- what is
13        interesting is, I'm a lumper, because the law
14        in this case calls for us to be lumpers, not
15        splitters.
16              What does that mean?  The contributing
17        cause, in order to be the cause of something,
18        it need not be the only cause.  It can be a
19        contributing cause.  Many things can combine to
20        cause something.  That's lumping.
21              When it comes to heart disease -- and
22        I'll point it out to you, it's in this book.
23        It's in the Surgeon General 2010.
24              The number one factor for smoking, for
25        heart disease, is smoking.  It acts in

1        combination with family, with family history,
2        with all these other things.  And you will see
3        that it's the number one factor, and
4        Dr. Mascarenhas said it acted in combination.
5              The questions they asked him tried to
6        make it seem like there's only one thing, was
7        it the cause.  That's not the law.  It's was it
8        a cause?  Could it have contributed with a
9        family history, which by the way, they said
10        assume hypothetically his father never smoked.
11              Well, you heard Dale and his brother
12        testify that his father did smoke.  So take
13        that away from it.  This is the perfect place
14        to learn about lumping.
15              When you guys saw that lengthy jury
16        instruction read to you over and over again
17        about contributing cause, acting in combination
18        with other causes, that's what lumping together
19        was, and we'll go through that.
20              This -- all the places where -- before
21        1996, Dale was diagnosed with chronic lung
22        disease, severe chronic lung disease secondary
23        to emphysema, chronic obstructive lung disease,
24        chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
25              Discrete effort capacity probably

1        secondary to associated COPD.  I assume they're
2        not going to spend time talking about this at
3        all, because they have no evidence whatsoever
4        to contradict it.  They didn't bring anybody
5        in.  Nobody, nothing.
6              This is manifestation for class
7        membership.  These are the symptoms.  You heard
8        the Judge instruct you.  Signs, symptoms, or
9        the diagnosis.
10              So there's eight places in the key
11        relevant time period before '96 when the
12        diagnosis was made, and here's nine places
13        where he was having wheezing and rales and
14        rhonchi and all that congestion and nasty stuff
15        in his lungs, which goes along with the
16        existence of the condition which he had.
17              So he had the disease in the relevant
18        class period.
19              And let me tell you how much evidence
20        they have to contradict it: Nothing, zero,
21        nada, zip, zilch.
22              Now, nine visits, he had symptoms of COPD
23        all in the class period.
24              So this is what -- this is what
25        Mascarenhas said.  I'll do it real quick.  I

1        shouldn't have to spend the time on it.  I
2        will.
3              Remember, this is the defense asking the
4        questions.  You agree looking at those risk
5        factors you can't say to a reasonable medical
6        probability which one was the cause?  No.  He
7        doesn't agree.
8              You lump them together.  There is a point
9        score which does put cigarette smoking at
10        number one.
11              I'll let them read the rest to you.
12              But the fact is, Dr. Civantos said: It's
13        a well-known, recognized fact that smoking
14        increases it.
15              And I asked him: Did it substantially
16        contribute to the production of his heart
17        disease, and it's true within a reasonable
18        degree of medical probability.
19              All by himself, addiction to cigarettes
20        causing heart disease is a class membership
21        qualification.
22              He was a heavy smoker, that means 100
23        pack years of smoking.
24              You know, if he's not an addicted smoker
25        who is sick from smoking -- he had the big

1        three: Heart disease, lung cancer, emphysema.
2        He had the big three.  If he's not a class
3        member, nobody could be a class member.
4              How big is the class?  Do the math.  It's
5        in the books.  How many people get sick every
6        year.
7              MR. BOYCE:  Objection.
8              THE COURT:  What is the objection?
9              MR. BOYCE:  Improper argument, misstates
10        the class definition and reference to harm to
11        others.
12              THE COURT:  Thank you, Counsel.
13              Ladies and gentlemen, I have instructed
14        you on the law.  My instructions are
15        concerned -- this is counsel's take on what the
16        evidence presented.
17              Proceed.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
19        Court.
20              I suggest to you -- here is what I do.  I
21        rebut the logic of the defendants' arguments.
22        If you take their arguments to the logical
23        conclusion, and it's old like Aristotle
24        philosopher way of doing logic: Reduce it to
25        its most basic components.

1              Reductio ad absurdum.  It's Latin.
2        You've probably heard of it.  It means, let's
3        take it all the way to its logical conclusion.
4              Their defense in this case will reveal
5        that under no set of circumstances could
6        anybody ever be a class member.
7              MR. BOYCE:  Objection.
8              THE COURT:  Sustained.  Sustained.
9              MR. BOYCE:  Move to strike and request a
10        curative instruction, please.
11              (The following discussion was held at
12              sidebar:)
13              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Hold my time, please.
14              THE COURT:  It's running time.
15              Listen, a couple things.  Number one, you
16        talk about what defense will argue.  Don't be
17        talking about -- they haven't argued.  You're
18        going into rebuttal and they haven't done their
19        argument yet.  You're saying -- going through
20        this.  Don't denigrate whatever defense they're
21        putting on.  I'm not going to tolerate it.
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.
23              MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, while we're here,
24        the objection that I had to the Shook Hardy
25        document was this.  Mr. Schlesinger said that

1        Shook Hardy hired that expert that came in to
2        testify.
3              First of all, that's not true.  It was
4        Brent Filbert.  He was with my firm.
5              But second, that's exactly the concern
6        that I had with that document, the tie-in to
7        attorneys in this case, and that's exactly what
8        happened.
9              THE COURT:  Yes, sir?
10              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I just want to go.
11              THE COURT:  Thank you.
12              (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
13              following was held in open court:)
14              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen,
15        regarding the last comment of counsel, just
16        disregard it.  All right?
17              Resume your closing statement.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
19              So Civantos talks about cause of death,
20        and he explains it's a combination of parotid
21        cancer and the COPD, and they both played a
22        role and they went hand in hand.
23              Remember what Civantos said.  And I asked
24        him, because we didn't get to get Dale here.
25        We would have liked to have Dale here.  He

1        didn't make it here.  You can't help that.  You
2        know what, 20 years after lawsuits are filed
3        for sick smokers, a lot of them die.
4              MR. BOYCE:  Objection.
5              THE COURT:  Counsel.  Sustained.
6              Counsel, it's not relevant in this case.
7        Come on.
8              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dale died before he
9        could get to court.  However, he was sick for
10        20 years from smoking.
11              When he died, he died from a
12        tobacco-related complexity of illness.  When
13        you get sick and you die of tobacco diseases,
14        like lung cancer and things like that, they
15        combine and they make it difficult to treat
16        you.
17              So as Dr. Civantos said, I could have
18        treated that condition.  I could have done
19        surgery on the cancer on his face, and given
20        him a high of 60 to 70 percent likelihood of
21        cure and additional life expectancy, but under
22        no set of circumstances could I do the
23        procedure because the pulmonologist wouldn't
24        let me.
25              And there's many records throughout there

1        that said he was not a candidate for surgery.
2        He was not an ideal candidate.
3              Now, he also said -- because we want to
4        be transparent with all the evidence.  We gave
5        it to you as it came in so you guys could
6        evaluate it -- that on balance, Civantos said:
7        I don't think -- I thought that cancer came
8        from his skin cancer.
9              Remember Policzer said: I think it's a
10        smoking-related cancer.  A head and neck
11        smoking-related cancer in the parotid.  That's
12        what Dr. Policzer said.  He was very forceful
13        about that.  That was his stated testimony.  In
14        it came.
15              Civantos said -- and I said: On balance,
16        how do you fall down on whether it's in the
17        parotid or not from something else, could be
18        from skin?
19              He said: More likely than not, I think
20        it's from skin.
21              And we presented that to you.
22              Now, if you decide the end-stage COPD on
23        top of the smoking-caused cancer, which by the
24        way, I remember in opening statement hearing
25        something about he had lung cancer for three

1        weeks.  There's no such thing as lung cancer
2        for three weeks.  I think that underplays what
3        the severity of the disease was.
4              He had lung cancer and surveillance of
5        successful treatment for five years.  Okay?
6              I don't think you can compare lung
7        cancer, something that comes and goes like the
8        flu for only three weeks.  He had lung cancer
9        on top of COPD, profoundly diminished lung
10        function, wasn't a candidate for the surgery on
11        his cancer that Civantos said was skin, more
12        likely than not.
13              But despite that, he could have saved him
14        70 percent, 60, 70 percent, except for the fact
15        he couldn't withstand surgery.
16              And Policzer said: It's a head and neck
17        from smoking.
18              If you say -- if you decide, hey, you
19        know what?  We know he was sick from smoking.
20        We know he paid a price for those cigarettes,
21        but we don't think that his death had anything
22        to do with it, if that's how you see the
23        evidence and that's why we provided it all to
24        you, we feel the greater weight of the
25        evidence -- that's why I brought these

1        scales -- it's what is more likely, what weighs
2        more, what persuades me more.
3              If you feel on balance the greater weight
4        of the evidence is clearly that cigarette
5        smoking played an important role in his death,
6        then the damages are death damages.
7              But if you don't go that route, the
8        damages are survival damages, for all of the
9        pain and suffering that Dale went through
10        during the years he was alive.
11              Here's all the records, they are all in
12        evidence.  Just so you know, you see this:
13        One, two, three, four, five, six.  You see
14        this, that's six gigantic Bankers Boxes, and
15        they are all for you.  All for you.  Take as
16        long as you like.
17              You can look through any of them.  All
18        the evidence is in there.  All the records are
19        in there.  All the internal documents are in
20        there.  Anything you want to know, take a
21        little work to find it.  You can all verify it.
22        It's all there.
23              But the bottom line for all of it, he's
24        not a surgical candidate.  Dr. Civantos
25        explained clearly the choice is surgery, not

1        radiation, and he had less than a 25 percent
2        chance of cure with the -- with chemotherapy,
3        because he knew it was palliative only.
4              That's what Dr. Policzer said.  You
5        weren't going to save Dale by going the route
6        of radiation when you weren't able to cure him
7        with the surgery, which was the primary
8        treatment.
9              Which is why when Dale had such a
10        terrible reaction to the radiation and he
11        already knew he wasn't really likely going for
12        cure, he knew he was in a rock and a hard
13        place.  That's what Dr. Civantos said.
14              They had to make a decision.  The
15        anesthesiologist wasn't going to put him to
16        sleep.  Alvarez told Dr. Civantos: There's no
17        way we can give this guy the surgery.
18              And as a result, he lived for a little
19        longer and he died.
20              This board here, I think that Mr. Hammer
21        showed you really quickly, you can look at it
22        from '95 all the way through 2013, chronicles a
23        progressive deterioration of this man's ability
24        to live a life because of chronic obstructive
25        pulmonary disease, destructive emphysema, which

1        is what cigarettes do to you.  Nothing else
2        does it.  There is no dispute it was caused by
3        it.
4              And his life got worse and worse and
5        tougher and tougher.  Even at the end in that
6        little day in the life film, you could see him
7        gasping for air.  Even in his depositions, you
8        saw him and you knew he lost function.
9              He lost those 20 years of life.  He could
10        have been out smelling the roses, doing all
11        that.  He lost all that.
12              We already covered this.  He's a class
13        member.  Here are the Engle jury findings.
14              You know, these were all disputed.  These
15        all had to be proven.  But they caused all
16        these diseases.  Nicotine in cigarettes is
17        addictive.  These cigarettes are defective and
18        unreasonably dangerous.  More dangerous than
19        they have to be.
20              They are inhalable.  They are highly
21        addictive.  They deliver a dose of nicotine
22        faster than any other way to the system, and as
23        a result, you can engineer them differently.
24              Dr. Proctor said: Take away the
25        inhalability.  Take out the addictiveness.

1        Give people a real choice.
2              They could do that, but they won't do
3        that.  That's the basis of their business and
4        the center of their universe.  That's the fraud
5        finding, because they lied about what they knew
6        and they lied intending for folks to rely on
7        it.
8              Down here the conspiracy, they all got
9        together and did it.  Liggett was part of the
10        conspiracy.  They all worked together, they all
11        paid the Tobacco Institute, the Tobacco
12        Research Institute, the TIRC.
13              The TIRC, they paid them to put out all
14        those phony papers.  They paid off the AMA.
15        They did a lot of stuff that doesn't meet with
16        the bounds of reasonable human decency in this
17        country.
18              Extraordinarily reprehensible conduct.
19        But all of these are findings that are
20        preclusive.  They can't deny them.  And you can
21        listen to hear how they talk about them to you
22        when they have a chance to talk.
23              This is the business, the lumper.  This
24        is the lumper -- instruction.  And then -- oh,
25        my goodness.  There's too many words there.

1              Let me tell you this.  Let's talk about
2        Dale Moyer.  Tobacco companies created a new
3        product for this, a new market for this altered
4        product, these inhalable cigarettes that
5        unleashed the dragon of nicotine addiction and
6        ingrained it into the fabric of society so that
7        it became the social norm to smoke.
8              Young Dale Moyer in the '30s, in the
9        '40s, in the '60s, all the way up to 1966,
10        there wasn't a single word on the pack of
11        cigarettes that said there was anything wrong
12        with it.
13              Everybody was smoking; doctors,
14        hospitals, you could smoke everywhere.  It was
15        the social norm.  More than half of men smoked.
16        He started smoking in an era of innocence.
17              Smokers most commonly switched to the
18        brands -- the leading brands that are
19        advertised more frequently and gained market
20        share in the popularity of the market.  That's
21        exactly what he did.  Just like Dale Moyer.
22              A majority of smokers fell prey to the
23        filter fraud of the '50s, and it was a filter
24        fraud.  Just like Dale Moyer.
25              And many smokers switched to Kent with

1        the Micronite filter and Lorillard marketed it
2        as a safer cigarette.
3              This is page 201 from Monograph 13.
4        Right here.  Look at that advertisement.  The
5        American Medical Association voluntarily
6        conducted their own laboratory and independent
7        tests and reported in JAMA.  These tests proved
8        of all the filters tested, one was the most
9        effective for removing tars and nicotine, the
10        filter used by Kent.  Just like Dale Moyer.
11              He was on those cigarettes for 25 years.
12        He was given the illusion of filtration.  They
13        never intended for the filters to work.  It was
14        a gimmick.
15              But Dale didn't know it was a gimmick.
16        He relied on it being something to help him.
17        He didn't know it was a gimmick.
18              Smokers switched to menthol, thinking
19        they were better for them.  They advertised
20        menthol as medicinal.  That's also in this
21        book.  They were also aware that menthol
22        cigarettes were much more addictive.
23              You know why?  The incredibly additional
24        addictiveness that menthol, which represents
25        one-third of the cigarette market in the United

1        States.  One out of every three cigarettes
2        smoked is menthol.  And they're smoked by teens
3        and youth.  They ease youth initiation, but
4        they deepen addiction and make it harder to
5        quit.
6              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
7              MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's in this book.
8              THE COURT:  Counsel.
9              Ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on
10        your own recollection of the evidence.
11              Thank you.  Proceed.
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Just like Dale Moyer.
13              Many smokers were fooled by the illusion
14        of safety created by lights and switch, rather
15        than keep trying to quit.  Just like Dale
16        Moyer.
17              Many smokers were unaware that the
18        cigarettes they were smoking were no better and
19        quite possibly the worst from the full flavor
20        alternative they switched from.  Just like Dale
21        Moyer.
22              Cigarette smokers were unaware that the
23        cigarette companies had gamed the systems as to
24        lights.  Just like Dale Moyer.
25              And fooling the FTC machine is right here

1        in Monograph 13, on page 233.  Fooling the
2        machines, and using the data to fool smokers.
3        This is the National Cancer Institutes of
4        Health.  The book is in evidence.  It lays it
5        out specifically.
6              Most smokers were unaware that the
7        cigarette had been engineered for addiction.
8        They didn't know about ammonia, flavorants,
9        flue curing.  They didn't know this is what the
10        cigarettes were being -- done, and neither did
11        Dale Moyer.
12              Dale was one of the millions of smokers
13        that fell into their marketing plan, followed
14        their marketing plan to a tee, stayed in the
15        holding strategy that they created.
16              They had no idea what the companies were
17        up to behind closed doors to manipulate the
18        information, environment and manipulate the
19        truth.  Just like Dale.
20              And it's in the book, over 95 percent of
21        daily smokers who try to quit fail because they
22        can't overcome the powerfully addictive effects
23        of nicotine.  Just like Dale.
24              Millions are caught in the web of deceit.
25        And more than that, this Surgeon General's

1        report, the new one, on page -- on the
2        introduction -- introductory section from
3        Howard Koh, Assistant Secretary of Health: On
4        the other hand, cigarette smoking remains the
5        chief preventible killer in America.
6              This is 2014.
7              With more than 40 million Americans
8        caught in a web of tobacco dependence.
9              That's -- I saw the web, it reminded me.
10        There's over 40 million smokers, and the
11        Surgeon General says there's over 40 million
12        caught in the web of tobacco dependence.
13              I explained that dependence and addiction
14        are synonymous terms.  And they are.  That's
15        because smoking is addiction.  That's what it
16        is.  That's all it is.
17              There's Dale.
18              In cases like this, the truth matters,
19        and you're supposed to have consequences for
20        the truth.  And when companies don't tell the
21        truth, there should be consequences.
22              When companies engineer for addiction,
23        there will be consequences.  When companies
24        target and addict teens, there should be
25        consequences.  When companies engineer for

1        addiction, there should be consequences.
2              When they offer up safe alternatives for
3        trying to quit, knowing they don't work and
4        they are just as dangerous, there should be
5        consequences.
6              When they choose to keep selling an
7        addictive, defective, unreasonably dangerous
8        product rather than fix it -- and as
9        Dr. Proctor said, take out the inhalability,
10        change the pH, lower the levels to subaddictive
11        levels, there should be consequences.
12              When companies sugarcoat and trivialize
13        the powers of nicotine addiction to hook the
14        next generation of teenagers, putting them at
15        unnecessary risk, there should be consequences.
16              When you sell a product and millions of
17        Americans, and there's still over 40 million
18        smokers, the truth matters.
19              And there are devastating consequences of
20        these companies' actions driven by
21        eyes-wide-open greed.  And that's why
22        punishment is appropriate.
23              I read that to you.  That's in the book.
24        That's hot off the press Surgeon General.
25              Don't forget presentism.  Look at this

1        case through the eyes of Dale Moyer in the
2        years he lived at the time he was there.  Not
3        all of us are anywhere near his age.  There's
4        no one in the courtroom here that's that old.
5        I think I'm probably the oldest lawyer in the
6        courtroom.  I didn't know that was going to
7        happen.  It does.
8              But for those of you that have been
9        around and know something about what it used to
10        be like then, work with your fellow jurors and
11        say, let's look at it like Dale was able to
12        look at it.
13              The case is about Dale Moyer, but the
14        case is much more --
15              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
16              THE COURT:  What is the objection?
17              MR. BOYCE:  Can we approach?
18              THE COURT:  Sure.
19              (The following discussion was held at
20              sidebar:)
21              THE COURT:  What is the objection?
22              MR. BOYCE:  He's encouraging jurors to
23        look at their personal experience based on
24        their age.  That's the Golden Rule, personal
25        life.  They just said some of you are older

1        than others, bring that experience in and help
2        the jurors --
3              THE COURT:  I agree.  All right.  Go
4        ahead.  Objection noted.  Sustained.
5              (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
6              following was held in open court:)
7              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I know I'm going fast.
8        I'm sorry.  I'm going to give you as much as I
9        can.  I know there's a lot of evidence here.
10        Some of the information you need to know.
11              One-third of all cancers in the United
12        States are caused by addiction to cigarettes
13        containing nicotine, and that's in this book.
14              If we eliminated cigarettes in this
15        country, it would be the same thing as finding
16        a vaccine that cured one-third of all cancer.
17              $200 billion every year are spent in
18        direct medical costs for the needless diseases
19        caused by the epidemic of nicotine addiction.
20              $200 billion a year are lost in this
21        country every year because of lost
22        productivity --
23              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
24              THE COURT:  What is the objection?
25              MR. BOYCE:  Relevance.

1              THE COURT:  Overruled.
2              MR. BOYCE:  Not appropriate basis for
3        punitive damages in this case.
4              THE COURT:  Thank you.
5              Objection noted.  Overruled.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And as you know,
7        Dr. Proctor, when they were asking questions
8        about it said it's a defective, unreasonably
9        dangerous product.  It's too dangerous to be
10        marketed.  It shouldn't be, it shouldn't exist.
11              And his book calls for the abolition of
12        tobacco.  That's part of the title of his book
13        that he read to you, the Cigarette Catastrophe
14        and the Case for Abolition.
15              Well, guess who agrees with Dr. Proctor?
16        Surgeon General 2014.  Major conclusion --
17              MR. WOODS:  Objection, beyond the scope.
18              THE COURT:  Sustained.
19              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Let me read this one
20        excerpt to you from the book:  The burden of
21        death and disease from tobacco use in the
22        United States is overwhelmingly caused by
23        cigarettes -- combustible cigarettes and rapid
24        elimination of their use will dramatically
25        reduce this burden.

1              So as an evidence-based standard, the
2        most modern science, the Surgeon General calls
3        for rapid elimination of the use of cigarettes.
4        That's just a scientific fact.
5              We talked about their design for
6        addiction with levulinic acid, ammonia
7        compounds and flavorings, menthol and special
8        filtration with tiny holes and bronchodilators
9        so your lungs will open up and see that
10        nicotine.  You saw that in opening.
11              They created this market for inhaled
12        nicotine that didn't exist, and they made
13        people, through this information, that were
14        affected by it.  Dale acted in direct
15        accordance with their plan.
16              And as His Honor read to you from the
17        description of the jury instructions, it
18        doesn't have to be any specific, exact ad that
19        went right to Dale.  It's whether it got there
20        indirectly, inferentially.
21              And it was not a one in one operation.
22        This $250 billion was -- go ahead and play
23        that -- was being spent to influence all of
24        America.
25 5894
1 2              follows:)
3              VOICE:  What cigarette do you smoke?
4        You'll be interested to know how the doctors of
5        America answered that question.
6              Doctors in every branch of medicine were
7        asked: What cigarettes do you smoke?  Do you
8        inhale?  Then you're better off smoking Philip
9        Morris, and here is how you can prove it.
10        Light up a Philip Morris.  Take a puff.  Get a
11        good mouth of smoke.
12              VOICE:  Join the men who know.  Nothing
13        satisfies like the big clean taste of top
14        tobacco --
15              VOICE:  Don't miss the bottom smoking:
16        (inaudible).
17              VOICE:  Let's take a Winston break.
18              VOICE:  That's it.  Winston is the one
19        filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times
20        a pack.  Winston has that blend (inaudible).
21              VOICE:  Yeah, Fred.
22              VOICE:  Take a good smoke.  Sure wish you
23        could taste it.
24              VOICE:  I am tasting it, Granny.
25              VOICE:  Kent with the Micronite filter is

1        smoked by more scientists and more educators
2        than any other cigarette.
3              Why not discover for yourself that for
4        good smoking taste, it makes good sense to
5        smoke Kent.  Wouldn't it make good sense for
6        you, too?
7              (Video clip concluded.)
8              MR. SCHLESINGER:  That was a minute 20.
9        To me it seemed like about six.  Play it out,
10        please.
11 12 13              follows:)
14        Q.    When did you switch to Kent?
15        A.    As soon as I found out about it, they
16 came out with a big advertising program about the
17 Micronite filter, and I jumped right on.  Because
18 that's when it started to become apparent that there
19 was a health problem due to smoking.  I never gave
20 that much thought before then.
21              (Video clip concluded.)
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  So there's lots of
23        advertising showing it's fun, it's hip.  Santa
24        Claus was selling cigarettes.  Santa Claus is
25        selling cigarettes.

1              Salem.  Salem cigarettes.  There's an old
2        carton.  Salem.  Merry Christmas.  People used
3        to buy these for gifts.  Prewrapped, ready to
4        go.  With an advertisement that says -- with a
5        warning: Caution, cigarette smoking may be
6        hazardous to your health.
7              But then again, it may not be.  That was
8        the doubt campaign --
9              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
10              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- of uncertainty.
11              THE COURT:  Excuse me, what is the
12        objection?
13              MR. BOYCE:  Preemption, violation of the
14        instructions.
15              THE COURT:  Thank you.
16              Ladies and gentlemen, objection noted.
17        Overruled.  You rely on my instructions, ladies
18        and gentlemen.
19              Proceed, Counsel.
20              MR. SCHLESINGER:  So again, we talked
21        about Dale being a smoker for -- he was 36
22        years old.  Smoked for 28 years by the time the
23        first caution came on the pack.
24              Remember, during this time, from '53 on,
25        they embarked upon the holding strategy.  The

1        doubt campaign.  They say it's an open
2        question.  We don't know what causes smoking.
3        We're bound to find out.
4              And the only caution said was: It may be
5        harmful to your health.  Well, then again, it
6        may not.
7              One of the things they talked about was
8        Dale should have quit.  They should have quit
9        too.  They should have quit lying.
10              Right here, 250,000 -- 250 billion.  When
11        I say 250,000, it's because 250 billion is
12        $250,000 million.  That's just a lot of money.
13              And this is from the FTC, the Federal
14        Trade Commission, you know, the effect of
15        advertising, saying tobacco spends more money
16        on marketing in one day than the public health
17        authority spends in a year.
18              So in terms of who is drowning out the
19        message, who is muddying the water, who is
20        creating this atmosphere of confusion, tobacco
21        certainly was.
22              Let's see what Dale says about it.
23        Please.
24 25 5898
1              follows:)
2        Q.    When you switched to Salem cigarettes,
3 why did you switch to Salem?
4        A.    I thought -- I don't know whether it was
5 right or wrong.  I thought that they were a better --
6 another step in the health direction.  Being less
7 harmful.
8        Q.    And you said at some point you switched
9 from Salem to Salem lights; is that right?
10        A.    Yes.
11        Q.    Why did you do that?
12        A.    Again, because I thought there was less
13 health problems.
14        Q.    And what gave you that idea, that there
15 was less health problems?
16        A.    They were light, the same way you -- the
17 connotation that you get with beer, thinking that
18 there's less calories or less whatever.
19              (Video clip concluded.)
20              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And remember, they knew
21        all along that the filters didn't do a thing.
22              Remember Claude Teague, one of the
23        documents?  He invented a color-changing
24        filter.  When you put the dye in it and when
25        the warmth comes to it, it would turn brown

1        because people attach great significance to
2        what is in the filter.
3              Even though it had no effect, the
4        marketing advantages are obvious.  So a fake
5        gimmick color-changing filter to make people
6        think something bad was being taken out of the
7        cigarettes.
8              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
9              MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's a document in
10        evidence.
11              MR. BOYCE:  Misstates the evidence on
12        whether that was ever used in any product.
13              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Come on.
14              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you are
15        to rely on your own recollection of the
16        evidence.
17              Proceed.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
19        Court.
20              That guy there, he won a gold medal in
21        the 400 in track, and he's smoking a Kent.  He
22        was advertising it.  Scientists and educators.
23              They are telling Dale Moyer through this
24        wallpaper advertisement, the 1967 FTC talks
25        about, the immersive advertising that nobody

1        could escape, that smart guys smoke Kent
2        because it's got the scientific Micronite
3        filter.
4              And then all along internally they said,
5        Cullen said, oh, if there's anything bad, we'll
6        take it out.  Filters are coming along now.
7              There were no filters back before the
8        health scare came out in the '50s.  Now it's 99
9        percent filters even today, 99 percent filters.
10        And they don't make things better, they make
11        things worse.
12              But they knew in their internal documents
13        that smokers were getting as much nicotine and
14        tar, but it abandoned the regular cigarette on
15        the grounds of reduced risks to health.
16              They knew it was an illusion of
17        filtration.  They said: We're going to say,
18        here is our triple filter.  Here is our
19        quadruple filter.  And incidentally, a nice
20        jolt of nicotine.  And if we could pull that
21        one off, how much will we be able to charge for
22        Kent?
23              That's the kind of stuff that they talked
24        about.
25              Page 20.  Important page in the blue book

1        says that: The designs with filters and lights
2        were used by the tobacco industry as a tool to
3        undermine cessation and prevention efforts.
4              Says there -- and this is the filter
5        cancer.  The filters made the particles
6        smaller.  It's in the book.  People draw in
7        deeper, deeper into the tiny air sacs of the
8        lung, the alveoli.
9              The only thing supposed to go in our
10        lungs is air.  But the poisons, the toxins go
11        in there.  The nicotine is what addicts and
12        drives the smoking.  The tar is the poison that
13        deteriorates the lung, causes the lung cancer.
14              And they see, wait a second.  When we
15        first had that cancer square in the '50s, 20,
16        30 years after people were smoking, we were
17        getting squamous cell carcinoma in the lung.
18              Now, since filters came out 20, 30 years
19        later, we're getting adenocarcinoma.
20        Adenocarcinomas are because of the change in
21        the filters.  So not only didn't they work, not
22        only were they never intended to work, but they
23        made things worse.
24              Oh, and by the way -- by the way, you may
25        not have seen this.  What kind of lung cancer

1        did Dale Moyer have?  Filter cancer.  He had
2        malignant adenocarcinoma, and it took until
3        2014 in that book, if you look up relative
4        risk, that the relative risk of cancer is
5        worse, cigarettes are more dangerous now than
6        they ever were because of these deeper
7        adenocarcinomas directly from filters.
8              And that's what happened to Dale.
9              Can you -- can your actions speak any
10        louder?  He lived it, he proved it, he did what
11        they told him to do.  He went to the Kents, he
12        went to the Salem lights, he got the filter
13        cancer that even doctors today are reporting as
14        recently as 2014.
15              This talks about FTC reports in evidence.
16        It talks about how people were made to think
17        cigarettes were safer with filters.
18              And finally, when this came out in
19        2001 -- and everything is a holding strategy.
20        Everything is a delay.
21              When this came out in 2001, it was still
22        seven more years before they finally rescinded
23        the guidance from the federal government saying
24        if you're going to smoke, smoke those filters.
25        Because the Surgeon General had been duped by

1        that smoking machine.
2              MR. BOYCE:  Objection.
3              THE COURT:  What is the objection,
4        Counsel?
5              MR. BOYCE:  Speaking about what the
6        Surgeon General knew, about the Surgeon General
7        being duped.
8              THE COURT:  Sustained as to what the
9        Surgeon General knew.
10              Other than what is in the report,
11        Counsel.  Thank you.
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, when the
13        FTC in 2008 put out his press release saying it
14        was no longer going to let tobacco companies
15        say what the government ratings were on tar and
16        nicotine in cigarettes.  They said that the FTC
17        will not be a smoke screen for tobacco
18        companies' shameful marketing practices because
19        of the misleading tar and nicotine ratings that
20        had previously been cloaked in government
21        sponsorship.  That's 2008.
22              That's not me, that's the federal
23        government saying it.  The FTC will no longer
24        be a smoke screen for tobacco companies;
25        shameful marketing practices.  And who was a

1        victim of that?  Millions of people.  Who was
2        one of those millions?  My client, Dale Moyer.
3              You know they went after teens and youth.
4        I've explained that.  You heard a lot about it.
5        And to me that's one of the things that is --
6        in terms of reprehensibility -- unforgivable.
7              And when we heard -- I remember hearing
8        in voir dire, folks talked about when did you
9        start smoking, when did you start smoking.  One
10        of the gals that didn't make it on the jury
11        said --
12              MR. WOODS:  Objection.
13              THE COURT:  Objection.
14              MR. WOODS:  What happened in voir dire is
15        not in evidence.
16              THE COURT:  Sustained.
17              MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, it's not
18        kid stuff to start smoking.  That very first
19        cigarette can start the process of addiction.
20              That's also in Surgeon General '2.
21              The very first puff of the very first
22        cigarette can start the process of addiction
23        for kids.  That's why the menthol is good for
24        teen initiation.  And once they get hooked --
25        and they don't know they're going to be smoking

1        30 years later.  It's a dangerous -- it's a
2        dangerous road.
3              And I remember Mr. Boyce had a drawbridge
4         up in his opening statement.  And I looked at
5        it.  It looks to me like it's a castle with a
6        drawbridge up and you can't overcome that.
7              I say it isn't a drawbridge up.  The
8        bridge is out and the kids that are lured over
9        that bridge that's out end up in the river of
10        addiction and end up down the stream --
11              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
12              THE COURT:  Thank you.
13              MR. BOYCE:  Improper argument.  Harm to
14        others, no connection to Dale Moyer.
15              THE COURT:  Thank you.
16              That objection is overruled, Counsel.
17              MR. BOYCE:  Thank you.
18              It's not a proper basis for punitive
19        damages.
20              THE COURT:  Thank you.  That objection is
21        overruled.
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  They end up going
23        downstream to that river of addiction,
24        ultimately to demise and to be replacement
25        smokers.  So to me the bridge is out.

1              And here is what you do when it comes to
2        thinking about kids, tender age, things like
3        that.
4              If you have the package, products,
5        remember, it wasn't until 1985 that there was
6        ever a warning on a side of a cigarette that
7        said it caused lung cancer, emphysema.  Before
8        1985 never said that.  Never said that.  Said
9        it may be hazardous, is hazardous, but never
10        said how it was hazardous .
11              But the kids that can get addicted of
12        this at a young age is -- that's the thing
13        that's reprehensible.  We'll talk about it some
14        more.
15              There is a Claude Teague document,
16        PT01040, is great.  Realistically, if our
17        company is to survive and prosper over the
18        long-term, we must get our share of the youth
19        market.
20              By the way, how do you warn a child, if
21        you really want to warn a chile?
22              If a child is on a diving board and he's
23        getting ready to go into a pool that's empty,
24        and they jump off the diving board and the pool
25        is empty and there is a sign that says "No

1        Diving."
2              Are people that really want to protect
3        the child, that really want to warn a
4        12-year-old or 14-year-old, let's say, going to
5        see him walk by that sign and say, Hey, you've
6        been warned.
7              Or are they going to say, "Stop!"  Are
8        they going to yell, are they going to run to
9        try to get to the ladder to grab the kid?  Are
10        they going to do everything they can to stop
11        the child?
12              The message coming out from tobacco
13        companies was one of seduction, lower your
14        fears, steal your fears, anything to make you
15        not worry about smoking.  Keep on smoking.
16              Here, this is Claude Teague.  Claude
17        Teague rose to the ranks of RJR.  He was senior
18        there.  There for his entire career.  They said
19        something like a few stupid people said a few
20        stupid things.
21              This is a master plan, a brilliantly
22        conceived conspiracy that lasted for decades
23        and made untold amounts of money.  And this is
24        what Claude Teague said, in his youth marketing
25        document in evidence.

1              It says: We have deliberately played down
2        the role of nicotine.  This is in the '70s.
3        Hence, the nonsmoker has little or no knowledge
4        of what satisfactions it may offer him.  No
5        desire to try it.
6              Then he said:  We must convince him of
7        the wholly irrational reasons that he should
8        try smoking, in the hope that he will, for
9        himself, then discover the real satisfactions
10        obtainable.
11              Now, you are entitled to decide whether
12        this kind of conduct is reprehensible, and
13        you're entitled to look at that and ask what
14        they're doing with satisfactions we know means
15        addiction.  And you can say to yourself, and I
16        submit that that's true, that that's cold
17        blooded, for a youth; that you're going to lure
18        him with something, and then he'll find the
19        real satisfactions obtainable.
20              And then there's that -- this year's
21        crop.  They call youth "the crop."
22              Now, has anything changed?  Here are the
23        replacement smokers.  That's kind of a callous
24        way of referring to 12-year-old, 13 year-old,
25        14-year-old, replacement smokers.

1              And then you've got over here, as
2        recently as 2010, this is in evidence.  There
3        is a Pediatrics article in evidence.  These are
4        the Barbie Camels, Camel No. 9, light and
5        luscious.
6              There is an article in Pediatrics saying
7        when that campaign came out, the percentage of
8        girls that were 12 to 16 years old that were
9        interested in these cigarettes doubled; and
10        that the result in the Pediatric scientific
11        article in evidence was that this was marketing
12        to youth, to children.  And they were bypassing
13        it.  And that was in '07, '08.
14              For a period of time, RJ stopped
15        advertising in magazines.  But we talked about
16        entitlement to punitive damages.  Have they
17        mitigated?  Have they changed?
18              Now, they say: Well, as long as there's a
19        certain percentage of the readership over 18,
20        we can advertise.  This is Glamour.  It's in
21        evidence.  That's one direction.
22              This is known as a boy band, the One
23        Direction.  People know that as a boy band.
24        Here is the organic hundred percent
25        additive-free tobacco, "organic" being the

1        modern health reassurance of our times.
2              Even though it has menthol, which is an
3        additive.  And if you go here, this is in
4        evidence, you will see it.  These are the kinds
5        of glamorous ads that they have in these
6        magazines today.  Dozens of magazines since
7        middle of 2013 come out.  You can pick them up.
8        Last week's People had these ads.  You can pick
9        them up anywhere.
10              Inspiration, where a moment becomes a
11        memory.  Discover the unexpected.  Celebrate
12        the unforgettable.
13              It's glamorizing smoking, and it's
14        glamorizing smoking in magazines that get to
15        youth.
16              One of the things we heard in opening
17        from Mr. Boyce -- I want to do this real
18        quick -- was something about Dale said it's
19        going to happen to the other guy.  That's why
20        he kept smoking, because he had been warned, he
21        knew it was bad, but he figured it would happen
22        to the other guy.
23              There was scientific basis behind that.
24        And I didn't want to leave the impression that
25        Dale was some sort of callous individual that

1        wished something bad on somebody else.
2        Couldn't be -- to the contrary.  The FTC
3        explained -- consumers incorrectly believed
4        that while smoking may be hazardous to others,
5        it's not hazardous to themselves.
6              That was part of the campaign the tobacco
7        companies tried to put on people so they would
8        be confused.  And Dr. Seidman, he said this on
9        his own during cross-examination: Smokers have
10        self-exempting beliefs because they are afraid.
11        They don't think it's relative to him.
12              That's the nature of the addict.  It's
13        the denial of the addict.  It's the
14        psychological crutch that the tobacco companies
15        wanted to give the addict, so they could keep
16        smoking.  Because if you keep smoking, you keep
17        selling.  They never wanted their smokers to
18        quit smoking.  They did everything they could
19        to keep their smokers smoking and everything
20        they could to stop them from quitting.
21              It was like operation stumbling block.
22        If you want to get an addict to quit, it has to
23        be a clear, concise, direct, red hot and
24        nonstop message.  You can't give them a place
25        to retreat in the world of denial, or they

1        won't get off the drug.
2              And even what's more, how about with
3        tobacco?  It wasn't until 1988 that the Surgeon
4        General finally figured out this is as
5        addictive as heroin and cocaine.
6              It was a secret addiction.  People did
7        not know even how addicted they were.  They
8        didn't understand it.  Do you think Dale Moyer
9        knew he was taking a drug in his body when he
10        was breathing those cigarettes 40 or 60 times a
11        day, that he was getting direct hits of
12        nicotine to his brain and a rewired brain since
13        he was nine years old?
14              Anyway, it's all about the nicotine.
15              Look at this.  Here is one of the
16        Dr. Tamil (phonetic), one of the big
17        scientists.  Let's determine the minimum
18        nicotine required to keep the normal smoker
19        hooked.  Right here they know people can't stop
20        smoking.  They use levulinic acid.
21              Do you think my client knew they were
22        using levulinic acid?
23              Who ain't for more money?  Do we really
24        want to tout cigarette smoking as a drug?  It
25        is, of course, but there are dangerous FDA

1        implications for going beyond these walls.  And
2        yet, when the FDA got them in 2009, Dr. Proctor
3        said they've had no effective regulation
4        whatsoever in the last five years.
5              MR. BOYCE:  Objection.
6              THE COURT:  Excuse me.
7              MR. BOYCE:  Misstates federal law,
8        misstates the reach of the FDA's authority.
9        Misstates the evidence in this case.
10              THE COURT:  Thank you.
11              Ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on
12        the evidence as you understand it in this case.
13        Thank you.  Proceed.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
15        Court.
16              So, and then, of course, what they said
17        internally.  These are secret internal
18        documents that Jed Wilson, JE Wilson, one of
19        the big guys up there in the companies.  These
20        were all well-regarded individuals.  As
21        Dr. Proctor said, the Cullmans were a
22        celebrated family.
23              Claude Teague, may he rest in peace, was
24        a beloved member of the RJR family.  Nobody was
25        censured, nobody was punished.  You will not

1        see in evidence one single piece of paper
2        anywhere from their internal documents that
3        comes out and says, Oh, we can't do this.  This
4        is wrong.  This is something we have to
5        retract.  I have to censure this guy.
6              That doesn't exist anywhere.  This was a
7        business plan.  This was a model business plan
8        that has cost 20 million Americans since 1964.
9        And as doctor --
10              So anyway, they knew they would go out of
11        business if they didn't have the essential
12        chemical compound, nicotine.  They knew that.
13              And then Merrell Dow.  I'll do this real
14        quick.  These documents are in evidence.  Big
15        chemical company.  They came out in the early
16        '80s with nicotine gum, and they were
17        boycotted.  One of the members of the
18        conspiracy boycotted them because they didn't
19        like what Merrell -- what nicotine gum was all
20        about.  Because they didn't want their smokers
21        quitting, and they didn't want somebody coming
22        out with a product.
23              So they actually impaired and impeded the
24        entry into the marketplace of smoking cessation
25        aids to help people.

1              MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's in evidence.
3              THE COURT:  Excuse me, Counsel.
4              MR. BOYCE:  Philip Morris, harm to
5        others, no connection to Mr. Moyer.
6              THE COURT:  Thank you.  Those objections
7        are overruled.
8              Ladies and gentlemen, I have instructions
9        or anything about reprehensibility and what
10        import, it's in the jury instructions.  You
11        rely on your recollection of what the evidence
12        is, and you rely on my jury instructions.
13              Proceed.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  So, remember, he read
15        to you the act of one conspirator in
16        furtherance of the conspiracy are acts of all
17        the conspirators in furtherance of the --
18              MR. BOYCE:  Objection.  That misstates
19        the jury instructions.  The jury instructions
20        in this case are for statements and omissions
21        only.  There is nothing about acts in this
22        case.  That is a misstatement.
23              THE COURT:  Thank you.
24              Objection noted.  Overruled.
25              Proceed, Counsel.

1              MR. SCHLESINGER:  May I proceed?
2              In any event, they felt the nature of
3        Nicorette gum was offensive to their business.
4        And Dale, remember, he tried the gum.
5              And this shows -- that's youth.  I'm
6        going to skip that.
7              This talks about they knew internally.
8        There was no doubt in the '50s and '60s that
9        cigarettes caused cancer.  They knew that.
10        Even before the business comes up about
11        nicotine addiction in the late '80s, this
12        business about causing cancer, every class of
13        smoke, there was no evidence to the contrary,
14        and they knew that it had the unattractive side
15        effect.  And remember, they promised we'll go
16        out of business.
17              But here is what they said amongst
18        themselves, because they celebrated their
19        business:  It's fortunate for us that
20        cigarettes are a habit they can't break, and
21        wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was the
22        first once to produce a cancer-free cigarette?
23              But that's what they were saying.  You
24        let the scientists do the work and you keep
25        going, enjoy.  But they were concerned.  If we

1        smoked one cigarette less a day, it would be 40
2        billion a year.  They were worried about losing
3        are business and profits.
4              And of course they got together.  They
5        did the Frank Statement, they talked about
6        that.  I'm not going to do it again.  They made
7        a lot of promises to the country that were not
8        true.  And they said, in this case you'll see
9        at least 11 or a dozen times Dr. Proctor talked
10        about, they promised they would stop making it.
11              Well they -- if they had told the truth
12        and been truthful about that promise, what a
13        different world we would live in today.
14              And can't you see Dale Moyer saying, if
15        he was here before you today: If I knew now
16        what I learned in this courtroom that you guys
17        learned in the last couple weeks, if I knew now
18        what I didn't know -- if I knew then what I
19        know now, would I ever be a smoker?  Would I
20        have been able not to start, or done definitely
21        everything I could to quit?
22              And again, the doubt and confusion.  They
23        employed a single strategy, defend itself on
24        three fronts:  Litigation.  It was brilliantly
25        conceived and executed.  They won battles.  But

1        it was always a holding strategy.  They held
2        Dale all along.  He was in their holding
3        strategy, and the whole organization was a
4        front and a shield.  It was nothing to do with
5        smoking and health.
6              Telling -- not telling the truth about
7        disease.  Here is what they said, and this
8        addresses something that was said in opening.
9        That was that paper where they said there's
10        cancer in every part of smoke.  You burn that
11        cigarette, you inhale that smoke.  There's
12        cancer everywhere, and we can't filter it.
13              But when they sent the information to the
14        Surgeon General, it says: We didn't find
15        anything that's unhealthy.  We didn't find any
16        cancer in there.  And by the way, we'll filter
17        it out if there's something in there.
18              I don't know what that is.  Here it is.
19        Oh, this is the kind of information they wanted
20        to give to the Surgeon General, to be as
21        burdensome and vague and irksome to the reader.
22        They were looking to confuse, confuse the
23        public health authority, confuse America.
24              And what did R.J. Reynolds do?  They
25        would say in their public statements: We don't

1        want that -- Surgeon General, we don't want the
2        public being hoodwinked.  They are unjustifying
3        emotional campaigns and health scares.  It's a
4        gross insult to the scientific community.
5        There's no honest disagreement among experts on
6        the effects of smoking.  It's all false.
7              The number one problem is the extent to
8        which these officials knowingly mislead the
9        American public.  There is an old saying: If
10        you don't have a leg to stand on, break the
11        other guy's leg.
12              So they undertook a campaign to knock out
13        the Surgeon General and -- go ahead and play
14        that -- and create an atmosphere of doubt and
15        uncertainty, which works great on guys like
16        Dale.
17 18 19              follows:)
20              VOICE:  It was suspect from the start.
21        HEW Secretary Califano launched his
22        anti-smoking campaign a year ago with all the
23        zeal of a reformed sinner.
24              And now, in an apparent attempt to bring
25        some science to the side of his new evangelism,

1        the former three-pack-a-day Secretary told the
2        Surgeon General: Prepare a new report.
3              "Its issuance," an internal HEW memo
4        said, and I quote, "would be a media event."
5        Closed quote.
6              Turning a significant health question
7        into a publicity stunt is an insult to serious
8        science.  America, beware if Joe Califano ever
9        gives up drinking or other pleasure pursuits,
10        even the most intimate.
11              (Video clip concluded.)
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  So they went ahead and
13        they would talk about how they preempted the
14        Surgeon General's report.  He would announce
15        it.
16              They would get out in front of him, they
17        would capture the media spotlight and preempt
18        with a first strike conference.  And they had
19        speakers covering millions of miles and logging
20        hundreds of hours on the air and hundreds of
21        appearances, because they were letting the
22        world know, Hey, the Surgeon General doesn't
23        know what he's talking about.  It's an open
24        question.  No one knows what causes lung
25        cancer.  Just keep on smoking.

1              And that river of cash kept on flowing.
2        Then when he finally came out and said, in
3        1988, and Surgeon General Koop, I think you saw
4        him, Hey, this is as addictive as heroin and
5        cocaine.  People have to realize that.
6              Even doctors weren't hearing him.
7        Remember, doctors used to smoke.  Claims that
8        cigarettes are addictive is irresponsible and
9        scare tactics.  That's what they called the
10        important announcements from the Surgeon
11        General.
12              '88 is in evidence and '89 is in
13        evidence.  And '89 says it's not free choice.
14        Because when you start smoking you get
15        addicted, it's not a free choice.
16              But addiction is their business.  The
17        cigarette is defective, unreasonably dangerous.
18        How could you make it less defective and
19        unreasonably dangerous?  Make it not addictive.
20        Raise the pH so you're not inhaling it deeply
21        into your lungs.  But they won't do that.
22              And then they go through here, subjects
23        to be avoided.
24              Mr. Woods, your head is in the way of my
25        slide.

1              MR. WOODS:  Sorry.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thanks.
3              Attempts to relate human disease to
4        smoking, subject to be avoided.
5              Return to your original position.
6              And this is what the Center for Tobacco
7        Research was doing.  They weren't doing any
8        good for anybody.  They were a front
9        organization.
10              And here's what is really interesting.  I
11        will do this super quick with ya.  Some doc
12        named Abood was doing some research.  He came
13        up with, sort of like Merrell Dow, an
14        antagonist to nicotine.  Or he thought he might
15        be able to come up with a chemical compound
16        that would block the nicotine.
17              They said: If he comes up with a way to
18        block the nicotine, you will have the potential
19        of putting the tobacco manufacturers out of
20        business.  So they wouldn't fund the study and
21        they blocked it.
22              But they said right there, if the
23        progress this guy is claiming is what it is, we
24        are in the progress of digging our own grave.
25              Again, anthropomorphizing themselves.

1              MR. BOYCE:  Same objection, to Philip
2        Morris --
3              THE COURT:  Overruled.
4              MR. BOYCE:  -- documents and the
5        conspiracy instructions in this case.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And now remember, if
7        one in five deaths in this country are related
8        to premature death from cigarette smoking,
9        picture in your mind what it would be like if
10        every single cemetery in the United States had
11        a little "no smoking" sticker on one out of
12        every five headstones.
13              I'm trying to think of ways to imagine
14        numbers that numb, because when you talk about
15        a few people dying, everybody knows about it.
16        When you talk about 20 million, it starts to
17        become numbing.  Yet it's the number one killer
18        in our country.
19              This I read to you.  You know about that.
20              This was in 1980, by the way.  Remember
21        in '88 the Surgeon General came out with the
22        warning that it was addictive?
23              In 1980 they were still worried about it.
24        They knew the public health authority was
25        coming out with this.  And it still took

1        another eight years to get out, because they
2        had great powers.  Dr. Proctor said they could
3        undermine and slow down the information getting
4        out to the public.
5              This is Teague.  He admitted that what
6        they did was -- the pharmaceutical industry.  A
7        cigarette is a nicotine delivery device.  Do
8        not think of the cigarette as the product.  The
9        cigarette is the package.  The product is
10        nicotine.
11              And then all through here they sew doubt,
12        confusion, deceit.  They said: Doubt is our
13        product, because it's a means of establishing a
14        controversy.
15              The key word is confusion.  Anything we
16        could do to confirm that will work to our
17        advantage.
18              We've got to give these smokers a
19        psychological crutch to begin smoking, and if
20        it wasn't for the TIRC, we would be in
21        deplorable position.  It's been a successful
22        defensive operation.
23              Look what they say here.  This is in
24        evidence, PT05837:  Nothing we can say can
25        adversely affect our litigation position.  For

1        purposes of litigation, the industry is not
2        willing to concede anything.
3              In the litigation venue we will require
4        the plaintiffs to prove causation, both legally
5        and scientifically.  We intend to play hard
6        ball with the victims of cigarette smoking when
7        they press their claims in the courtroom.
8              This is the industry's ultimate public
9        relations sham.
10              Our position continues to mislead the
11        public, with a wink.
12              At the end there, it's not shame, it's
13        sham.  And it's the ultimate public relations
14        sham.  You will see the document, PT05837.  You
15        will see it.  You can read it.
16              I don't know if I want to listen to this
17        guy.  Is it the montage?
18              TECHNICIAN:  I think it's the montage.
19              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Play it.
20 21 22              follows:)
23              VOICE:  (Inaudible.)
24              We will cooperate in every way.
25              VOICE:  Well, obviously, a filter takes

1        out certain tar and nicotine.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  (In open court.)
3        Faster, if you can.  Go to the next part.
4              VOICE:  (Inaudible.)
5              Because when, as, and if any ingredient
6        in cigarette smoke is identified as being
7        injurious to human health, we are confident
8        that we can eliminate that ingredient.
9              VOICE:  Do you believe the cigarettes are
10        safe?  Have they been proved to be safe,
11        Mr. Cullen?
12              VOICE:  I believe they have not been
13        proved to be unsafe.
14              We do talk to the question of whether or
15        not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not
16        believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We
17        don't accept that.  Because when, as, and if
18        any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified
19        as being injurious to human health, we are
20        confident that we can eliminate that
21        ingredient.
22              VOICE:  Do you believe that cigarettes
23        are safe?  Have they been proven to be safe,
24        Mr. Cullen?
25              VOICE:  I believe they have not been

1        proved to be unsafe.  And I concluded from that
2        report that it's true, that babies born to
3        women who smoke are smaller.  But they are just
4        as healthy as babies born to women to do not
5        smoke.  And some women would prefer having
6        smaller babies.
7              (Video clip concluded.)
8              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Before we play this,
9        the industry is based on deception and nicotine
10        addiction, and the basic bottom line is, with
11        youth being where the seed corn is where people
12        start smoking, the design of cigarettes, highly
13        engineered legal nicotine delivery device to
14        make it as easy as is humanly possible to begin
15        smoking an as hard as humanly possible to quit.
16              Why should it be so hard?
17              And the industry claimed during all those
18        years it did not know, it did not know, it was
19        unknown.  And now you hear them make what I
20        call the big pitch and say: Everybody knew.
21        Everybody knew.
22              Dale Moyer should have known what they
23        didn't know and what they refuse to admit.
24        When all he did was be the perfect customer
25        they wanted in the era of innocence.  Well, by

1        the time the information was getting out there,
2        he was terribly addicted.
3              Go ahead and play that.
4 5 6              follows:)
7              VOICE:  Here's the controversy about
8        cigarettes.  In the 91st Congress, a House
9        committee heard testimony from leading experts
10        on smoking and health.  The record shows that
11        most of the country's most respected doctors
12        openly challenged anti-cigarette claims.
13              VOICE:  And I'd have to disagree with you
14        in that we don't know what causes the ailments
15        that have been attributed to cigarette smoking.
16              VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause
17        cancer; yes or no?
18              VOICE:  It is not known whether
19        cigarettes cause cancer.  Has not been causally
20        established.
21              VOICE:  Cigarette smoking -- no causal
22        relationship between cigarette smoking and
23        emphysema?
24              VOICE:  Despite all of the research to
25        date, there has been no causal link

1        established.
2              VOICE:  The case is still open.  The jury
3        has not come in.
4              VOICE:  It may not be harmful?  You're
5        not convinced?
6              VOICE:  It may be, or it may not be.  We
7        don't know.
8              VOICE:  Do cigarettes cause cancer?  I
9        don't know if they do not.
10              VOICE:  I'm not in a position to give you
11        a does or does not.
12              VOICE:  The medical experts agree that
13        smoking causes emphysema.  Do you agree?
14              VOICE:  It may.
15              VOICE:  They agree that smoking causes
16        lung cancer.  Do you agree?
17              VOICE:  It may.
18              VOICE:  We have looked at the data, and
19        the data --
20              (Video clip concluded.)
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  You've seen it.  I'm
22        only going to go a few more minutes with this.
23              But the -- they worked out a plan.  The
24        plan worked.  My client was a victim of the
25        plan.  He belongs in the class.  He deserves a

1        right, as a conduit, so you guys can go to the
2        next phase, find that these folks not only hurt
3        him, probably killed him, and leave behind
4        folks that are grieving, compensate them fairly
5        with whatever you think, and then go to the
6        important question, which is really the
7        question that I want to talk about.  And have
8        we shown by clear and convincing evidence that
9        this is reprehensible conduct?  Doesn't meet
10        the bounds of human decency, and merits a
11        strong expression of moral condemnation?
12              So this is just manipulating nicotine,
13        this is sales correlated with nicotine, this is
14        when they got that, you know, freebased
15        nicotine, they got more sales out of more
16        nicotine.
17              These were all the opportunities over the
18        years for the tobacco companies to come forward
19        and tell the truth.  They could have come
20        forward and told the truth.  They could have
21        taken it upon themselves to say we're not going
22        to let 21-year-olds -- anyone under 21 get the
23        cigarettes.
24              They could have helped people.  They
25        could have said, you know what?  You have been

1        our customers since you're 14, 16 years old,
2        you're 30 years old.  The guy that's 30, says I
3        want to start a family, comes to them.  They
4        could have helped him quit cigarettes and had
5        cessation and still had a business.
6              They could go back to a non-defective
7        product, a cigar-like product.  They could go
8        to a non-addictive product.
9              So, when it comes to choice, it's a
10        two-way street.  My client had choices, they
11        had choices.  For class membership, it's only
12        whether or not he was dependent upon that drug.
13              Then you can go to comparative fault
14        relative -- that Mr. Hammer talked about.  He
15        talked about compensatory damages.
16              I'm not allowed to talk to you about
17        punitive damages or an amount that would be
18        fair and appropriate until you decide that
19        punitive damages may be warranted, and that's
20        the last question.
21              And there's Dale.  This is a picture I
22        always liked of Dale.  I like that picture of
23        Dale.
24              So this is what it says.  That they are
25        warranted if you find by clear and convincing

1        evidence that the defendant was guilty of
2        intentional misconduct which was a substantial
3        legal cause of Mr. Moyer's smoking-related
4        illness.
5              So with everything they did, the kind of
6        thing that makes them guilty.  And this is --
7        this is in evidence.  It's the 1964 Life
8        Magazine back when the Surgeon General's report
9        was coming out.  And there's a "Government
10        Report Nails Down Smoking Hazards.  Verdict on
11        Cigarettes: Guilty as charged."  This is in
12        evidence.
13              And I submit to you that it's 1964.  And
14        we're here 50 years later.  And as far as this
15        particular decision that you all can make --
16        because I wanted to come up with something -- I
17        wanted to say something beautiful and American
18        and meaningful, and instead I read a bunch of
19        boards to you, and I'm sorry for that.
20              But they are guilty.  And the clear and
21        convincing evidence shows this doesn't meet
22        with the bounds of human decency.
23              We ask you when you get to that last
24        question, check off yes.  We will come back,
25        talk to you for a little bit more.  And you all

1        can say to them in the strongest possible
2        terms, we don't want you to do this.
3              Clear and convincing evidence is that
4        which is precise, explicit, lacking in
5        confusion and of such weight that it produces a
6        firm belief or conviction, without hesitation,
7        about the matter in issue.
8              And there is no illusion about the
9        confusion.  There is no doubt about the doubt.
10        So the fact that they produced confusion for
11        decades doesn't get them off the hook in this
12        courtroom, because now you've seen what some
13        folks thought they knew, but now you know.
14              You come in here, many -- many are
15        called, but few are chosen.  We went through a
16        lot of jurors.  We chose you.  And you might
17        have thought you knew.  But now that you've
18        entered into the College of Tobacco Knowledge
19        for these last three weeks, now you know.
20              And when you consider whether or not
21        punitive damages are warranted, and you want to
22        know about reprehensibility and whether a day
23        of reckoning, punishment for past misdeeds is
24        justifiable in this case, you may consider
25        similar harms suffered by other persons not

1        parties to this lawsuit in assessing the
2        reprehensibility or the wrongness of the
3        defendants' acts as proven in this case.
4              That's why you heard so much evidence
5        from Dr. Proctor, a day and a half laying out
6        the entirety of the conspiracy, how it was
7        formed, how it was enacted, how it was a
8        holding strategy.  How it maintained all the
9        way through and how successful it was.
10              How many cigarettes they're able to sell
11        to so many people, despite intentionally
12        knowing full well that their customers were
13        dying and calling the youth that would pick up
14        the habit and pick up the addiction to sustain
15        their profits replacement smokers.
16              And what did they say?  Because the
17        holding strategy is one that you know
18        eventually you're going to get caught.
19              They said: Our basic position in the
20        cigarette industry, in the cigarette
21        controversy is subject to the charge and may be
22        subject to a finding that we're making false or
23        misleading statements to promote the sale of
24        cigarettes.
25              We're not going to play this.  You've

1        already played it.
2              TECHNICIAN:  That's the end.
3              MR. SCHLESINGER:  This guy here.  That
4        guy, his fault.  Seven, eight years old.
5        That's the guy.  He had a chance?  What chance
6        did he have?
7              So I hope I stitched it together for you,
8        and if you see it our way, I hope not only will
9        you follow through this difficult verdict form,
10        through the compensatory damages, but get to
11        the question that to me is the most important
12        question and reason why we're here, which is
13        the concept of punishment, the day of reckoning
14        for them.
15              And if you do, we'll come back for
16        another day or so, and we'll talk about it a
17        little bit more.
18              I ask you to give the same kind of
19        attention to defense during their closings that
20        you've given to me.
21              But I do get one more chance to talk to
22        you.  So I will say this.  Save a little room
23        for dessert.  Thank you.


17           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Please the Court,
18     counsel.
19           Okay, folks.  Home stretch.
20           My dad was a trial lawyer for really --
21     many years.  He's in his 65th year of
22     practicing law.
23           He tells a story about an old-timey,
24     tough judge in Broward County.  And we had some
25     old-timey, tough guys back then, where he

1     explained to me, when you're in the courtroom,
2     in front of that trial judge, you are in front
3     of the most powerful man on the earth.
4           And these early judges, in the '60s, they
5     knew who they were and they knew what they
6     were.  And, one time, dad was working in a
7     case, and they were getting ready to give, I
8     guess, opening statement or -- or, no, picking
9     a jury, or something like that, and dad's like,
10     we can break for lunch, Judge, because it was
11     getting on 1:00, and the jury was antsy and
12     they were hungry; and the Judge said, well,
13     we'll break for lunch when you're done with
14     your voir dire examination, Mr. Schlesinger.
15     So he moved it along.
16           And that's what I'm going to try to do
17     with you.  And I would like you to start by
18     looking at the findings in this case, the Engle
19     findings from -- I guess, 36, if you would put
20     it up -- and let's keep our eye on the ball,
21     because I heard a lot of things that are what I
22     consider to be nothing more than denials of the
23     truth --
24           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- of why we're here.

1           THE COURT:  Counsel, this is argument.
2           Proceed.
3           MR. SCHLESINGER:  And, remember, we are
4     bound by --
5           The jury instruction says, these findings
6     are if -- as if you found them yourselves.
7           Now, if you tell a lie to a public health
8     authority, and submit a bunch of distraction
9     research to them and a bunch of phony baloney
10     nonsense that doesn't get to the question of
11     smoking and disease as part of a conspiracy to
12     keep people smoking, and you get away with it,
13     and the healthcare -- the innocent National
14     Cancer Institute healthcare official writes
15     back, hey, thanks for all this information you
16     sent, because that's a salutation, and you
17     conned them, you don't get credit for that.
18           If, in the '70s and '80s, you conned the
19     Surgeon General, the National Cancer Institute,
20     and the Federal Trade Commission into saying,
21     if you're going to smoke, smoke light
22     cigarettes, and then billions were adver --
23     billions of dollars were advertised, showing
24     how light cigarettes deliver less tar and
25     nicotine, and that fraud is not exposed until

1     the National Cancer Institute does it in the
2     year 2000, in this -- in this monograph, and
3     explains very clearly that that's exactly what
4     it was, fooling the machines and using the data
5     to fool smokers --
6           This is Page 233:  Filters and cigarette
7     papers were developed starting in the '50s that
8     air conditioned the smoke by diluting the smoke
9     column with side stream air.  When smoked by
10     the machines, as in the FTC tests, low-tar,
11     low-nicotine numbers resulted.  A desirable
12     outcome for promotional purposes, but higher
13     yields were ingested by real smokers, a
14     desirable outcome for maintaining nicotine
15     addiction.
16           My client, you'll see from the
17     instructions, in terms of reliance, does not
18     have to have a direct connection between a
19     particular ad and his behavior.  His behavior
20     is the reliance, in context with the
21     conspiracy.
22           Now, Lorillard, Liggett, Philip Morris,
23     R.J. Reynolds --
24           MR. BOYCE:  R.J. Reynolds.
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- I wasn't going to

1     forget -- they bought American Tobacco Company,
2     Brown & Williamson, and they assumed the
3     liabilities -- these folks were --
4           Not these folks.  These folks are
5     lawyers.  They may be nice guys, but they are
6     not RJR, they are not the tobacco company.
7     They can bring any witness they want down here,
8     but they did not bring --
9           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
10           THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Sustained.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  They can choose to
12     bring any witness, and I'll tell you --
13           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
14           THE COURT:  Sustained.
15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  You did not hear from
16     them, on any evidence --
17           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- from any --
19           THE COURT:  Sustained.
20           MR. WOODS:  Burden of proof.
21           THE COURT:  Why don't you move on,
22     Counsel.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  All of the witnesses
24     that testified, Dr. Civantos, Dr. Policzer,
25     Dr. Wolek, who was not an expert, he was a

1     treating, Dr. Rozynes, who signed the death
2     certificate was a treating, Dr. Civantos was a
3     treating, right?  Dr. Policzer was a treating
4     doctor.
5           What does that mean?  Back at the time,
6     in the '90s and the 2000s, those guys were men
7     on the street, watching something unfold.  They
8     have credibility.  They have the unbiased
9     approach that comes from men that were just
10     trying to take care of a patient.  They were
11     just trying to take care of Mr. Moyer.
12           You heard no evidence to the contrary.
13     Everybody that testified --
14           And we just went and brought, for the
15     most part --
16           Except for Daniel Seidman, a true
17     authority on addiction, who had never been in a
18     courtroom before, and came in here and told you
19     that Dale Moyer was highly addicted.  They came
20     right in and told you, this man was addicted,
21     these addictions contributed to cause the
22     disease, that's what drives the smoking, and
23     that's the only thing that matters with being a
24     class member.
25           And they blurred some distinctions here,

1     in terms of could he quit, and whether or not
2     he could quit, and that goes to the question of
3     fault.  That's the next set of questions on the
4     comparative negligence form.
5           And if you think that he should have quit
6     harder, more -- he could have quit more, you
7     can adjust the percentage of his relative
8     responsibility any way you want.  But ability
9     to quit has nothing to do with what the
10     unrebutted testimony --
11           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
12           MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
13           THE COURT:  Overruled.
14           MR. BOYCE:  Class membership --
15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  The unrebutted
16     testimony of his addiction-driven disease, a
17     heavy, heavy smoker, smoking for the nicotine
18     that you know their business is built on, is
19     his entitlement to be in the class.
20           Similarly, they did not present any
21     evidence to counter the fact that everybody,
22     including Dr. Mascarenhas, said he was
23     addicted, and said that his chronic obstructive
24     pulmonary disease was in the class period, was
25     before 1996.  That's unrebutted.  There is

1     no -- nothing to the contrary.
2           Mr. Boyce may have made some of his own
3     opinions that --
4           Remember, the Court says, it's not law
5     when the lawyer says it; it's got to be
6     evidence in the case.
7           Dr. Civantos was a great witness.  Take
8     what he had to say.  He said, this man doesn't
9     get parotid surgery to save him because he
10     can't withstand it because of lung disease.
11           And that's what Dr. Alvarez told him.  I
12     can quote the testimony, if I can find it, but
13     there's no doubt the man was not a candidate
14     for surgery.
15           There's no doubt the chronic obstructive
16     pulmonary disease and his inability to breathe
17     was a contributing cause.
18           They said, oh, skin cancer is a terrible,
19     terrible disease.  Well, so is lung cancer, and
20     so is emphysema, which is a severe form of
21     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
22     that's what Dale suffered from, to the point
23     where, in 1999, when he saw Dr. Mascarenhas,
24     his major problem was problems with breathing.
25           In 2003, he went on supplemental oxygen,

1     which he used as he needed it.  So this --
2           And then, in 2000 -- by 2008, he was
3     described as a respiratory cripple by
4     Dr. Mascarenhas.  The man had a very severe set
5     of diseases from smoking.  There's no -- and
6     there's just no evidence to the contrary.
7     The -- the --
8           This instruction says:  Each defendant is
9     legally responsible for every act by each of
10     the co-conspirators taken in furtherance of
11     their agreement to conceal or omit material
12     information regarding the health effects of
13     cigarette smoking or the addictive nature of
14     smoking cigarettes.
15           These companies and organizations include
16     the defendants, as well as Philip Morris USA,
17     Brown & Williamson, American Tobacco Company,
18     the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, the
19     Council for Tobacco Research USA, and the
20     Tobacco Institute, and RJR and Lorillard and
21     Liggett.
22           They were all part of the conspiracy.  So
23     they concealed and omitted material information
24     not otherwise known or available.  I went
25     through a lot of their internal documents that

1     demonstrate it.
2           And these books here are replete with
3     data about it, and I encourage you to look at
4     them.
5           If you want to look at something, look at
6     Page 105 of Surgeon General '10.  There's an
7     entire chapter on nicotine addiction.  That's
8     all smoking is.  It's nicotine addiction.
9     Think about it --
10           I said yesterday, reductio ad absurdum,
11     reducing to the absurd.  I said it was an
12     Aristotelian sort of philosophical form of
13     logical analysis.
14           Under their standard, nobody could ever
15     be a class member, because everybody could
16     quit.  Therefore, they can't be a class member,
17     if class membership is based on quitting, which
18     His Honor, who gave you the law, did not say
19     that it was.
20           So, you know, they just don't seem --
21           They're using different language.  And
22     the law says --
23           Just like they tried to say, he caused --
24     his heart disease was not the cause -- smoking
25     was not the cause of his heart disease; smoking

1     was a cause of his heart disease.
2           And if we go to --
3           I know where it is.
4           This is what I want to do.  I think it's
5     Page 353 of the book.  Hammer, if you want to
6     try to find it for me, okay?
7           Let me see if I can get it here.
8           There's a section here on Page 355,
9     tobacco use and cardiovascular disease.  And it
10     explains that each risk factor is
11     multiplicative of the other risk factors.
12           If you have one risk factor, it's 2X; if
13     you have two risk factors, it's 4X; and that
14     tobacco cigarette smoking is the number one
15     risk factor.  And that's what Mascarenhas said
16     and that's what Dr. Civantos said.
17           It's another way into class membership.
18     He absolutely had it manifested before 1996.
19     You can look in this book.  It's an absolute
20     combination, a lumper.  It's a multiple cause
21     that contributes to cause the disease.  Smoking
22     is one of the contributing causes.  That's --
23     that's what's covered by the law in the case.
24           They talked about this magazine.  It's in
25     evidence, you'll look at it.  It's full of

1     advertisements for cigarettes.  Front and back,
2     there must be four or five full-page
3     advertisements for cigarettes in here.  And
4     you'll see it.  The --
5           When they talked about the Philip Morris
6     documents don't apply to them, they do.
7     Everything -- everything the TIRC does applies.
8           Baron (sic), do you have that clip about
9     the TIRC, please?
10           TECHNICIAN:  Sure.
11            (The video clip was played and taken
12     down to the best of the reporter's ability as
13     follows:)
14           VOICE:  That brings us to the here and
15     now.  You may take for granted a great many
16     aspects of the Tobacco Institute, if you knew
17     of them at all.  Most organizations would feel
18     at a disadvantage with such a low profile, but
19     this is entirely appropriate to our work, since
20     most of what we do takes place out of sight of
21     the public and the rest of the industry, even
22     though our concerns are very much those of the
23     public and the industry.
24             (Video clip concluded.)
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Mr. Moyer is not

1     supposed to know what they're doing.  He's just
2     supposed to be part of that information
3     environment that affects him.  And he was.
4           MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor,
5     improper argument.
6           THE COURT:  Overruled.
7           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now, the reliance part
8     on the statements, remember, his actions spoke
9     louder than words.  He followed the company
10     plan.
11           When they came up with the filters, which
12     were a fraud all along, the illusion of
13     filtration -- they even invented a fake,
14     color-changing filter that didn't work -- they
15     knew all along, they knew well in advance of
16     the Surgeon General -- they were light years
17     ahead of him -- they took advantage and wrapped
18     themselves in the Surgeon General and the FTC's
19     approval, and finally the FTC came out -- I
20     showed you that press release in 2008 --
21     saying, they can no longer wrap their shameful
22     marketing practices in an appearance of
23     approval by the federal government.  We will no
24     longer be a smokescreen for them.
25           This here says that -- it's not just a

1     fact, but it's a concealment or an omission.
2     Mr. Boyce kept saying "statements," he didn't
3     rely on a statement; but he relied on
4     statements and omissions.
5           His behavior was, when they came up with
6     filters, and Kent was safer, he went to Kent
7     because he thought it was safer.  And that's a
8     stumbling block to actually trying to quit.
9     And those were the years before the concept of
10     addiction came out.  The concept of addiction
11     didn't come out until 1988.  And, by the way --
12     1985.
13           Can I have the ELMO?
14           In 1985, it never said addicted --
15     "addictive" on it, never said "COPD," never
16     has.  The warning hasn't changed in the last 30
17     years, and the FTC says, the warnings are of no
18     effect.  It's the beautiful advertising.  The
19     warnings are worn out.  That's what the FTC
20     says.  It's in evidence.  Look closely.
21           Zoom in on that, can you?
22           TECHNICIAN:  Yep.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  You see what that says?
24     That there is a zebra, my friends.  You
25     don't --

1           You won't see that anywhere, on a pack of
2     cigarettes anywhere.  But right before the
3     Master Settlement Agreement in 1996, Bennett
4     LeBow, the CEO of Liggett, did come clean about
5     some things, and he's the one that unmasked a
6     lot of the conspiracy.
7           And he said, you know what?  I'm going to
8     put, "Warning:  Smoking is addictive" right on
9     the front of the pack.
10           And you know what?  It isn't there
11     anymore.  Philip Morris bought this brand.  You
12     can't find it, and you can't --
13           MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
14           THE COURT:  It's not in evidence.
15     Sustained.
16           MR. BOYCE:  And move to strike.
17           MR. SCHLESINGER:  It is in evidence from
18     Dr. Proctor, who testified that --
19           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you are
20     to rely on your own recollection of the facts.
21           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.  And I will submit
22     to you that Dr. Proctor testified -- look at
23     your notes -- that if you buy a pack of
24     Chesterfields today, you will not see "smoking
25     is addictive" on a pack of cigarettes, because

1     it's not there.
2           They can put anything they want on it,
3     but addiction is the center of their business.
4     They want to tell you that -- you want to talk
5     about Dale Moyer, this is about Dale Moyer?
6           Sure.  But it's also about them.
7     Otherwise, you wouldn't have heard all this
8     evidence about their conduct over the years.
9     Otherwise, you wouldn't have seen those
10     findings -- go back to the screen -- that talk
11     about their -- they are all culpable of fraud
12     and conspiracy to hide the truth, and it
13     wouldn't be the kind of thing that is now a
14     major conclusion in the recent Surgeon
15     General's report.  The --
16           A material fact is one that is of such
17     importance that Mr. Moyer would not have
18     acted -- acted as he did, but for the
19     concealment or omission.  It is not necessary
20     for -- that a direct statement be made to
21     Mr. Moyer in order to give rise to the right to
22     rely upon the statement.  It is immaterial
23     whether the statement passes through a direct
24     or circuitous channel in reaching Mr. Moyer,
25     provided the statement is made with the intent

1     that it reach him and he acted on it.
2           And remember what it says there:  These
3     were meant to be relied on.  They expected
4     folks --
5           They expected folks, when they lied about
6     the addictive nature, that the public would
7     rely to their detriment.
8           And you did not hear one single reference
9     to an acknowledgment of any of these, when the
10     law says that you embrace them as if you found
11     them yourselves.
12           And they wanted to talk about Mr. Moyer,
13     but Mr. Moyer's one of all the similar
14     cigarette smokers, millions of them, that have
15     all fallen into the same trap.  That's the
16     nature of the business.  The --
17           This slide (indicating).  These slides,
18     please.
19           Okay.  I want to show you something.  On
20     Page 1 of Surgeon General '10 --
21           This is my reading copy.  You'll have a
22     clean copy.
23           On Page I, Roman Numeral I, my copy, it
24     says:  Tobacco smoke damages every organ in the
25     body and causes disease and death.  Okay?

1           Now, these records are in evidence.
2           Remember we talked about the hip, okay?
3     And we know the man was -- was -- had a hip
4     injury.
5           Take a look at this.  When he came in for
6     the problem with his hip, he had aseptic
7     necrosis of the left hip, okay?
8           You know why?  The patient does have a
9     history of long-term steroid use for bronchitis
10     and emphysema, aseptic necrosis of the left
11     hip.  Hip osteonecrosis.  Left hip
12     osteonecrosis.
13           Go to the next one.  Where's the
14     surgical -- the surgical report?
15           Go to the next one.
16           MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, I would object.
17     It's not in evidence.
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is all in
19     evidence.
20           MR. WOODS:  Any connection between --
21           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me.  This is in
22     evidence.
23           MR. WOODS:  Can we have a sidebar?
24           THE COURT:  Sure.
25           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can you hold my time,

1     Judge, please?
2           MR. WOODS:  It will be quick.
3           (The following discussion was held at
4     sidebar:)
5           THE COURT:  Yes, sir, Mr. Woods?
6           MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, I have an
7     objection because there is absolutely no
8     medical evidence in this case whatsoever
9     connecting his hip problems, his hip surgery,
10     with smoking.  None.  He can't make this --
11           THE COURT:  Excuse me.  I don't think the
12     emphasis was there.  He's asking --
13           These are medical records in evidence,
14     correct?
15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.
16           THE COURT:  He's allowed to talk about
17     these.
18               (Sidebar concluded.)
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Put it back up.
20           Do you have the surgical report, as well?
21           TECHNICIAN:  That is the --
22           THE COURT:  Excuse me, Counsel.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I need the full page.
24           Yes?
25           THE COURT:  Ready to proceed?

1           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, I am, please the
2     Court.
3           THE COURT:  Go ahead.
4           MR. BOYCE:  Just for the record, there's
5     no claim that smoking caused --
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me.  It's a
7     speaking objection.
8           THE COURT:  Hold on.
9           MR. BOYCE:  There's no claim that smoking
10     caused bone disease in this case.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me, Judge.
12           THE COURT:  Thank you.
13           Counsel, we went sidebar.  The objection
14     was made; I overruled the objection.  We're
15     moving on, all right?
16           Thank you.
17           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I need the operative
18     report, please, with the language from the
19     operative report.
20           May I proceed?
21           THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
22           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm sorry, guys.
23           Rebuttal is tough because, on the fly,
24     I'm trying to catch all these points.
25           But I'm trying to show you this:  He went

1     in for the hip, he had hip osteonecrosis, he
2     was found to have aseptic necrosis of the left
3     hip because the patient had a long-term history
4     of steroid use for bronchitis and emphysema.
5           At his operative note, it said that his
6     hip -- and you'll see it in the record -- total
7     osteonecrotic collapse of the hip at surgery.
8     And then there's another record in here where
9     it uses the term "osteoporosis."
10           That's the next slide.  Put up the next
11     slide.  If you can find the operative note,
12     you'll put it up, okay?
13           Osteoporosis.  Now, do you remember I
14     spoke to Dr. Civantos about the side effects of
15     osteoporosis?  We talked about the side effects
16     of osteoporosis.
17           I'll get there.
18           And he explained, among other things --
19     and we have records on this -- part of this
20     man's weight gain was from his steroid use,
21     long-term steroid use, to try to help him
22     breathe better.
23           And there are records in there -- I may
24     not be able to put my hands on them -- where
25     the poor fellow is complaining about his

1     difficulty gaining -- losing weight, because
2     he's been on steroids, and they're adjusting
3     steroids.  And abnormal body fat deposition was
4     one of Dr. Civantos' opinion.
5           I said:  What else does it do?
6           He said:  It washes out your bones and
7     gives you osteoporosis.  This man had
8     osteoporosis, with a resultant osteonecrotic
9     collapse of his hip, and surgery, secondary to
10     steroids for emphysema and COPD.
11           And, by the way --
12           Can I have the ELMO?
13           In evidence, Page 4 --
14           And I said that smoking hurts every
15     single part of the body.
16           Let's get the whole head in there.
17     That's fine.  That's good enough.
18           You see one of the things that -- the
19     health consequences causally linked to smoking
20     and exposure to secondhand smoke:  Hip
21     fractures.
22           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
23           MR. SCHLESINGER:  When a man smokes --
24           THE COURT:  The objection's noted.  It's
25     overruled.

1           MR. BOYCE:  Same objection.
2           MR. SCHLESINGER:  When a man smokes for
3     55 years, up to three packs of cigarettes a
4     day, he is not doing it for the advertising and
5     marketing terms of "enjoyment" and "pleasure"
6     and "satisfaction," okay?
7           He is doing it because, as Claude Teague
8     said, nicotine is the sine qua non of smoking.
9     The sine qua non.  That's Latin.  It means,
10     without which, there is nothing.  That is what
11     smoking is.
12           There is no acknowledgment here.  Call it
13     what you want, addiction, make up any term you
14     want --
15           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
16           MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
17           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- this is not --
18           THE COURT:  Excuse me.  This is argument,
19     Counsel.  Overruled.
20           MR. SCHLESINGER:  So, you want to talk
21     about personal responsibility?  Let's talk
22     about personal responsibility.  Let's focus on
23     that.  Because corporations are treated as
24     persons under the rights of the law of this
25     case and, therefore, they also have the

1     responsibilities of persons.
2           And I said, if you want to be a person,
3     act like a person.  Behave with decency towards
4     your fellow man.  And this -- this industry has
5     not, and they continue to not do so.
6           And what you should do is, you should
7     protect children.  You should not mislead them
8     or prey on them.  Children should be protected,
9     right?  We should help people.  We shouldn't
10     hinder attempts to quit.
11           Zyban was a new drug that wasn't around
12     that long.  By the time he got to it, it helped
13     him quit.  But, also, he had to learn that
14     his -- his disease process of COPD had
15     progressed to the point where it was so bad
16     that he quit -- he finally quit using Zyban
17     when the "S" hit the fan -- they love to say
18     that over and over about this guy, okay? -- but
19     you saw this man testify for hours.  Remember,
20     he was only questioned by his adversaries.
21     There was no question --
22           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
23           THE COURT:  Sustained.
24           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- by his lawyers
25     there.  The questioning was --

1           THE COURT:  Excuse me.
2           MR. WOODS:  He had every opportunity --
3           THE COURT:  Counsel, I ruled, all right?
4     I don't want you to keep talking after I ruled.
5           MR. WOODS:  Sorry.
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  The treaters in the
7     records that you saw are contemporaneous.
8     Mr. Moyer was questioned, as an elderly man, in
9     2012, 2011.  His last deposition was a year
10     before he died.  And he was reflecting back
11     into the '90s.
12           But those records in evidence were every
13     one of the treating doctors that we brought in
14     to tell you he had this disease process in his
15     lungs, in the class period, and he was addicted
16     to smoking, he was a heavily addicted smoker,
17     and that that smoking addiction was a direct
18     and continuous cause of his disease process,
19     all testified to you, unrebutted, as credible
20     experts who were just there taking care of him
21     at the time.  So the --
22           And you met the client.  He seemed like
23     he was a straight shooter, if you watched him,
24     in the records; and, quite frankly, he did say
25     something that was facetious.  I don't know why

1     they kept talking about it.  He said, I was so
2     impressed by what the fellow had to say that I
3     finally quit 30 years later.  So, the --
4           THE COURT:  Five minutes, Counsel.
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  In this book, on Page
6     517, it says here:  The cigarette industry has
7     been artfully maintaining that cigarette
8     advertising -- did I read this to you guys
9     yesterday? --
10           THE COURT:  Counsel --
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- that cigarette
12     advertising has nothing to do with total sales.
13           This is complete and utter nonsense.  The
14     industry knows it's nonsense.  I'm always
15     amused by the suggestion that advertising, a
16     function that has been shown to increase
17     consumption of virtually every other product,
18     somehow miraculously fails to work for tobacco
19     products.
20           Mr. Moyer continued to smoke the Salems
21     after 1982, he testified, because he thought
22     they were safer.  Lights connoted safety.  He
23     relied on that.  His behavior and his actions
24     speak louder than anything else.  Just like he
25     smoked filters.

1           He fit their company marketing plan to a
2     tee.  Therefore, he relied, but he got sick.
3     If you think he should have tried harder, then
4     all you have to do is, on the comparative
5     negligence comparisons, give him a higher
6     percentage.
7           But all Mr. Hammer suggested was
8     five percent, because I think that, reasonably,
9     what they did, not just negligently, but
10     intentionally, through conspiracy and fraud and
11     intentional concealment and selling a
12     dangerously defective product, more dangerous
13     than it needs to be, is at least 20 times worse
14     than what they did.
15           He was an innocent.  If his human
16     weaknesses were such that, try as he might --
17     and he did try -- try as he might, he was
18     unable to quit until he came down with a
19     devastating disease, then you take that into
20     consideration and you give him the percentages
21     of fault you feel are attributable to him.
22           But I would say that you could equally
23     argue that what they did was a hundred times
24     worse, because they did it on purpose and they
25     did it for money.

1           If you want to talk about personal
2     responsibility, what about the personal
3     responsibility of all of these executives and
4     all of these scientists and all of these men,
5     who spent all of this time making all of this
6     money on the backs of addicted smokers, knowing
7     full well that what they were doing was going
8     to result in the death of millions of
9     Americans?
10           How about the personal responsibility of
11     a corporation to make decisions to cure cancer,
12     not cause cancer?
13           And here's -- here's a shout out to
14     Liggett, because Liggett's role in the
15     conspiracy is a little bit less -- although,
16     they are an active part of the conspiracy --
17     but despite the industry's arguments about --
18     about smoking, there are times when cigarette
19     company executives, themselves, have
20     acknowledged that marketing reaches and
21     influences underage adolescents.
22           For example, in 1997, Bennett LeBow, CEO
23     of the holding company that owns Liggett,
24     stated:  Liggett --
25           MS. RUIZ:  Objection, Your Honor.

1           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- acknowledges the
2     tobacco industry markets to youth --
3           THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.
4           MS. RUIZ:  Objection.  That's not in
5     evidence, Your Honor.
6           MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is in evidence.
7           THE COURT:  It's the Surgeon General's
8     report?
9           Ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on
10     your own recollection of the evidence.
11     Counsel's representing to me he's reading from
12     something in evidence.
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you, Judge.
14           THE COURT:  The objection's noted.  It's
15     overruled.
16           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Page 518.  For example,
17     1997, Bennett LeBow, CEO of the holding company
18     that owns Liggett, stated:  Liggett
19     acknowledges that the tobacco industry markets
20     to youth, which means those under 18 years of
21     age, and not just those 18 to 24 years of age.
22           Later that year, Mr. Bennett LeBow
23     further testified that cigarette companies --
24     all the cigarette companies -- targeted young
25     people to try to keep people smoking, keep

1     their business going.
2           So that's an admission that he finally
3     came out with, but it's true that that is an
4     important basis of their business, and it
5     always has been.  The --
6           You cannot deny in this courtroom that
7     this is an addictive drug, because the findings
8     say so, every -- every witness that testified
9     says so.
10           And if not Mr. Moyer, who?  Everybody
11     could try harder to quit under that scenario.
12     Everybody could smoke more cigarettes.  If they
13     smoked one pack a day, that's not enough, you
14     got to smoke two packs a day.  If you smoke two
15     packs a day, it's not enough, you got to smoke
16     three packs a day.  If you tried 30 patches,
17     that's not enough, you got to try 60 patches.
18           Even if you think that some of that is
19     true and some of the human weaknesses of
20     Mr. Moyer apply, it's on the fault part of the
21     question.  But in terms of, is he a class
22     member, Engle has class members.
23           Was he someone whose dependence on
24     smoking was a cause, a part of the drive that
25     led him to consume a million cigarettes into

1     his lungs and get sick?  You bet he was a class
2     member.
3           Does he bear some responsibility?  Yes.
4     But we think the evidence is it was far less
5     than what they bear.  I think if --
6           You saw our client, Mr. Moyer, up there.
7     I thought he was a straight shooter.  You can
8     make your own decisions.
9           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
10           THE COURT:  Thank you.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I take that back.
12           THE COURT:  Counsel --
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  You can make your --
14           THE COURT:  You need to start wrapping
15     up, Counsel.
16           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  And, then, in
17     19 --
18           One of the documents by Lorillard, that
19     they didn't read, that's in evidence, talks
20     about:  By taking advantage of these
21     opportunities, we can forcefully refute
22     Reader's Digest criticism related to smoking.
23           There was a handful of smoking articles
24     in Reader's Digest, but Lorillard was out there
25     trying to knock them down, just like they

1     knocked down the Surgeon General.
2           There's also a document in evidence that
3     says:  We now possess a knowledge of effects of
4     nicotine far more extensive than exists in the
5     public -- in the public literature.  They
6     had --
7           In 1990, there's a school letter to
8     fifth-grade students, from RJR to the school
9     children of Willow Ridge School, in evidence:
10     Despite all the recent research going on, the
11     simple and unfortunate fact is scientists do
12     not know the cause or causes of the chronic
13     diseases sought to be reported and associated
14     with smoking.
15           If everybody was supposed to know, why
16     didn't the tobacco companies know?
17           And what a difference the world -- it
18     would have made if they had been morally honest
19     with their customers and done what they knew
20     they needed to do.  And that was do something
21     about this deadly, cancer-causing product.
22           The Surgeon General, 2010, says --
23           MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
24           THE COURT:  Excuse me.  What's the
25     objection, Counsel?

1           MR. BOYCE:  The objection is, Your Honor,
2     quoting from the Surgeon General's report.
3     None of this stuff has been talked about with
4     the jury, with a witness.  There's no context
5     for it.
6           THE COURT:  Thank you.  It's in evidence,
7     Counsel.  Your objection's noted.  It's
8     overruled.
9           Mr. Schlesinger, I do remind you, you
10     need to wrap it up.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.  The preface
12     to the Surgeon General '10:  The way tobacco is
13     grown, mixed and processed today has made
14     cigarettes more addictive than ever before.
15           Here, Page 355.  I knew I would find it,
16     on the -- on the heart disease:  Beyond its
17     status as an --
18           Page 355, Surgeon General '10, the blue
19     book:  Beyond its status as an independent risk
20     factor, smoking appears to have a
21     multiplicative interaction with the other major
22     risk factors for coronary heart disease, high
23     serum levels of lipids, untreated hypertension,
24     and diabetes mellitus.
25           And then, also, in Surgeon General

1     2012 --
2           And I embrace it.  They wanted to quote
3     from Surgeon General --
4           MR. BOYCE:  Your Honor --
5           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- 2012.  Please review
6     it.
7           MR. BOYCE:  -- can we go sidebar for one
8     quick second?
9           THE COURT:  Sure, Counsel.
10           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thanks, Judge.
11           (The following discussion was held at
12     sidebar:)
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sorry, Judge.
14           THE COURT:  The problem is --
15           MR. WOODS:  By my count, his time expired
16     a minute ago.  We all worked very hard to get
17     in under two-and-a-half hours.
18           Your Honor told him five minutes ago --
19     you told him to wrap up.  He then read two more
20     exhibits, another quote from the Surgeon
21     General, and he just keeps going.  He's out of
22     time.
23           The last thing he should get to say to
24     this jury is "thank you," or give five more
25     minutes to each defendant.  But we worked

1     really hard last night to get in under
2     two-and-a-half hours.  He is out of time now.
3     It ought to be over.
4           THE COURT:  Counsel, I guess part of the
5     thing is, I have a running clock here, and I
6     know Mr. Schlesinger's asked for something
7     different than that, but we've had at least
8     three sidebars here during his rebuttal
9     argument.  That takes time from what's going
10     on.  I have told him, I want you to wrap it up.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
12               (Sidebar concluded.)
13           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Again, this will be in
14     the --
15           THE COURT:  Hold on, hold on.
16           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yep.
17           THE COURT:  Madame, you all set?
18           COURT REPORTER:  Yes, sir.
19           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Time limit to a lawyer
20     talking is agony, but I have to wrap up.
21     There's a few things --
22           Again, you'll see them in the record.  I
23     was reading to you that --
24           I read to you about the heart as a
25     multiplicative risk factor.  In terms of

1     addiction causing disease, I pointed out a
2     bunch of stuff from Surgeon General '10.
3           Surgeon General '12, the red book, on
4     kids:  One of the most significant health
5     effects is addiction to nicotine that keeps
6     young people smoking longer, causing increased
7     physical damage.
8           That's right in the preface, the
9     introductory pages of that book.
10           And on Page 871 of the Surgeon General
11     2014, it says:  The cigarette is also a
12     defective product, meaning, not just dangerous,
13     but unreasonably dangerous, killing half of its
14     long-term users, and addictive by design.
15           And the FDA, as Dr. Proctor has
16     testified, hasn't been able to put through any
17     regulation.  And if you look at the --
18           MR. BOYCE:  Objection.
19           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
20           MR. BOYCE:  Objection, Your Honor.
21           THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Sustained.
22           Counsel, you need to wrap it up, all
23     right?
24           That doesn't mean going on to new topics,
25     all right?

1           MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.  Let me just
2     see if I've got one more here, Judge, and I'll
3     call it a day.
4           There's only one thing I want to read.
5     It will take me less than a minute.
6           George Orwell wrote a book called "1984."
7     And in that --
8           One of his quotes in that book --
9           MR. BOYCE:  Your Honor --
10           THE COURT:  Overruled.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.  In that --
12           In that book, he had a quote that, you
13     know, was a post-apocalyptic quote, and it
14     talked about ignorance is strength.
15           There's another counter quote by a famous
16     person I don't remember now:  Knowledge is
17     power.
18           And George Orwell said this:  In --
19           And it was played by Richard Hurt and --
20     No.  Richard Burton and John Hurt.
21           And Richard Burton was leaning over John
22     Hurt, and whispering in his ear before they
23     were going to torture John Hurt, and he said:
24     You must stop imagining that posterity will
25     vindicate you, Winston.  Posterity will never

1     hear of you.  You will be lifted clean out from
2     the stream of history.  We shall turn you into
3     a gas and pour you into the stratosphere.
4     Nothing will remain of you.  Not a name in a
5     register, not a memory in a living brain.  You
6     will have been annihilated in the past, as well
7     as in the future.  You will never have existed.
8           By your verdict, you can see to it that
9     when Mr. Moyer, in his death, has --
10           MR. WOODS:  Objection.
11           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- risen up against the
12     tobacco company --
13           THE COURT:  Overruled.
14           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- you can see to it
15     that he will not be forgotten and he will not
16     be absent as a name in a register.
17           You'll be able to register he was one of
18     millions.  And like so many millions of others,
19     you can consider harm to others in
20     determining --
21           MR. BOYCE:  Objection.
22           MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- the reprehensibility
23     of the conduct --
24           It's in the instruction.
[#DELETED OBJECTION DIALOGUE#]
18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I want to say that I
19     will not presume to tell you what you must do,
20     nor what I believe you absolutely will do.
21           I will tell you what I have told many
22     juries that I've had an opportunity to speak
23     to:  I wish you great luck at arriving at a
24     just result in this case, and I hope to get to
25     be able to talk to you again.  Thank you.
