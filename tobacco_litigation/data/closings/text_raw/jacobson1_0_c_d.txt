19          MR. GERAGHTY:  May it please the Court.
20          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
21          You know my name is Bill Geraghty.  On behalf of
22 myself, my partner, Frank Cruz-Alvarez, and Philip Morris, I'm
23 going to start by thanking you for your jury service.
24          Our legal system depends on good people like you who
25 are willing to give up their time to help us decide a civil

1 lawsuit like this.  I know that you have all paid very close
2 attention to the evidence, and everyone involved in the case
3 really appreciates your time and effort.  So let me start
4 simply by just saying thank you very much for your service in
5 this case.
6          We are getting close to the end of the case, which
7 I'm sure is music to all of your ears, and it is almost time
8 for you to retire to the jury room and deliberate.
9          Judge Ungaro will give you a set of legal
10 instructions and a verdict form, and then you are going to be
11 asked to decide the issues in this case.  But before you head
12 off to deliberate, I'd like to take this opportunity to
13 summarize the evidence that we've seen and heard during the
14 course of the trial.
15          Now, remember during my opening statement I told you
16 that the plaintiff would spend a good amount of time talking
17 about statements or representations made by Philip Morris,
18 Lorillard and other tobacco companies, many of which were made
19 more than 30, 40 or 50 years ago, and I told you, ladies and
20 gentlemen, I would not try to defend those statements.  Philip
21 Morris and Lorillard made statements and had ideas that today
22 neither you nor I would say or think.  But I also told you
23 that if that was what this case was really about, we all would
24 have gone home two weeks ago.
25          But we didn't, and that's because this case isn't

1 about all cigarette smokers.  It's not about the general
2 public.  It is about one former smoker, Fred Jacobson, and it
3 is only about him.
4          And now, ladies and gentlemen, after having heard all
5 of the evidence, you know that Fred Jacobson wasn't paying
6 attention to anything that Philip Morris or Lorillard was
7 saying.
8          Judge Ungaro is going to instruct you that the
9 plaintiff bears the burden of proof in this case to prove to
10 you that a cigarette company's statement made by a cigarette
11 company, or something that they failed to say, had a direct
12 connection and a substantial impact on Fred Jacobson's
13 decisions about cigarette smoking; and there was simply no
14 evidence to support that in this case.
15          Just as I told you in my opening statement, you heard
16 from Mr. Jacobson's family and friends that he was strong,
17 intelligent and well informed.  That's what they told you.
18 From an early age, Mr. Jacobson was well aware that cigarette
19 smoking came with significant health risks, and despite those
20 risks, he chose to smoke for many years.
21          He wasn't waiting for Philip Morris or Lorillard to
22 tell him, you know what, smoking is dangerous, you need to
23 quit.  He heard from his family, his friends and from his
24 doctors that cigarette smoking was bad for his health and that
25 he should quit.

1          But Fred Jacobson for many years enjoyed smoking and
2 was not interested in quitting.  But the key point here,
3 ladies and gentlemen, is that was Fred Jacobson's decision and
4 his decision alone.
5          Now, let me say something about the findings you've
6 heard from this class action, and there's no debate about
7 this.  Those findings don't tell you how to answer any of the
8 questions on the verdict form, and that's because by your
9 verdict you will decide, ladies and gentlemen, you get to
10 decide, whether those findings have any meaning in the context
11 of Fred Jacobson's life and the decisions that he made.
12          After all, this case is about Fred and Ronnie
13 Jacobson.  Mrs. Jacobson is the one who filed this lawsuit and
14 she is the one asking you to award her millions of dollars for
15 her husband's decision to smoke cigarettes.  And you are the
16 only jury, ladies and gentlemen, that has heard Fred
17 Jacobson's story.
18          Now, I started my opening statement two weeks ago
19 with a list of issues that were not in dispute in this case.
20 We can add one more item to the list.  Everyone in this
21 courtroom feels sympathy for Mrs. Jacobson for the loss of her
22 husband.  We are all human.  It is only natural to feel
23 sympathy for someone who has lost a loved one.
24          But as Judge Ungaro instructed you at the beginning
25 of the case, and she's going to remind you one more time, you

1 have to set those natural feelings of sympathy aside and
2 decide this case based only on the evidence you heard from
3 that witness stand during the course of the trial and from the
4 legal instructions that you are about to get from the Judge.
5 And knowing how hard and diligent you've worked so far in the
6 trial, we all have no doubt that you're going to be able to do
7 that.
8          Now, before we get into the evidence, I want to
9 remind you what we discussed about the sources of evidence
10 that you heard during the course of this trial, and I asked
11 you to pay close attention to that first source of evidence.
12          The medical records that were written by the doctors
13 who treated Fred Jacobson and the patient questionnaires and
14 insurance forms that Mr. Jacobson himself filled out, you now
15 know why that evidence is so important, because it is the only
16 evidence we have today in this case that comes directly from
17 Fred Jacobson himself.  And this evidence was created many
18 years before anyone was thinking about filing a lawsuit,
19 before anyone had a financial interest in remembering things
20 in a way that was favorable to their case.
21          Now, Judge Ungaro is going to tell you, you can
22 choose to believe or disbelieve any witness you hear, and
23 she's going to tell you to think about a series of questions
24 to help you decide that.  And I put some of these questions on
25 this board.  This is what Judge Ungaro is going to tell you to

1 ask yourself as you listen to the evidence.
2          Did the witness impress you as one who was telling
3 the truth?  Did the witness have any particular reason not to
4 tell the truth?  Did the witness have a personal interest in
5 the outcome of the case?  Did the witness seem to have a good
6 memory?  And finally, did the witness' testimony differ from
7 other testimony or evidence you heard during the course of the
8 trial?
9          And as you saw throughout this trial, much of what
10 you heard from Ronnie Jacobson about her husband and his
11 cigarette smoking was contradicted by what Fred Jacobson told
12 his own doctors, by what he wrote down in his own records, and
13 by what his friends and family members told you about
14 Mr. Jacobson.
15          And Mrs. Jacobson's testimony was contradicted on
16 important points in this case:  For example, whether he read
17 the warnings and knew that cigarette smoking was dangerous
18 many, many years ago; whether he quit smoking several times
19 for more than a year or two; and whether he was ever, ever
20 diagnosed by any of his doctors with COPD.
21          Just as I told you she would, Mrs. Jacobson confessed
22 to you that today there are many things she cannot remember
23 because it has been so long ago, more than 20, 25, and in some
24 instances more than 30 years ago.
25          And so, as you think about the evidence you heard,

1 please consider that Judge Ungaro will instruct you that you
2 get to decide whether you find each witness to be believable
3 or whether you think some of the things the witness said were
4 influenced by an interest they have in the outcome of the
5 case.  The Judge will instruct you that you can accept or
6 reject any testimony you've heard during this trial, in whole
7 or in part.  That is your job, ladies and gentlemen, and your
8 job alone.
9          Now, you'll remember that at the beginning of the
10 case I told you it was about two words:  "Control" and
11 "responsibility," "control" and "responsibility."  And we're
12 going to walk through all of the evidence you've heard during
13 the course of this trial.  And just as I did in my opening, I
14 want you to consider a series of questions as we talk about
15 the evidence.
16          Who was in control of Fred Jacobson's lifestyle
17 choices, including his choice to smoke cigarettes?  Who was in
18 control of his efforts to quit smoking?  Who controlled Fred
19 Jacobson's motivation to quit?  Was Fred Jacobson addicted,
20 and if so, was he someone whose addiction was so strong, so
21 substantial, that it overpowered his ability to quit?  And
22 finally, did Fred Jacobson rely on anything, anything that
23 Philip Morris or Lorillard said or failed to say about the
24 health risks of smoking?
25          Now, we've heard a lot of testimony about the

1 lifestyle choices that Fred Jacobson made.  He made those
2 choices, no one else.  Fred Jacobson was strong and
3 independent.  He lived his life the way he wanted, and that
4 included smoking cigarettes.
5          You now know that Fred Jacobson enjoyed smoking
6 cigarettes and you know now that his wife, Ronnie Jacobson,
7 also enjoyed smoking cigarettes.  Smoking was simply something
8 that Fred and Ronnie Jacobson wanted to do, and for many years
9 it was not something that Mr. Jacobson wanted to give up.
10 Like many people, Fred Jacobson knew that smoking was
11 dangerous.  Yet, as you heard, his attitude with family and
12 friends was:  Mind your own business.  Let me live my life the
13 way I want to live it.  And he had every right to do so.
14          We all have the right to make decisions for
15 ourselves, even decisions that today, with the benefit of
16 hindsight, we might say were not in his best interests.  We
17 believe in the freedom to make choices.  That is a fundamental
18 principle upon which our country was founded.  But with that
19 right, ladies and gentlemen, comes the obligation to accept
20 personal responsibility for the consequences of those choices.
21          Now, let me talk to you very briefly about the burden
22 of proof.  You've seen documents.  You've seen medical
23 records.  You've heard several days' worth of testimony.
24          The plaintiff bears the burden to prove each of her
25 claims in this case by what is called a preponderance of the

1 evidence.  That's what the Judge is going to tell you.  So,
2 what does that mean?
3          That means to tip the scales in her favor, the
4 plaintiff was required during this trial to produce more
5 evidence and more persuasive evidence than the mountain of
6 evidence that we have presented to you during the course of
7 this trial, the mountain of evidence that shows Fred Jacobson
8 was always in control; that Fred Jacobson did not have COPD;
9 that he was not hopelessly addicted; and that his claimed
10 addiction was not the legal cause of COPD.  And we're going to
11 walk through all the evidence you've heard during the course
12 of this trial, and I'm going to show you, ladies and
13 gentlemen, that the plaintiff has failed to carry her burden
14 of proof.
15          Now, during my opening statement I showed you a
16 timeline, and we used that timeline to walk through all of the
17 significant events in Fred Jacobson's life, and I'm going to
18 show you that timeline again, and I'll show you that
19 everything we told you about Fred Jacobson we proved it during
20 the course of this trial.
21          But before we do that, I want to remind you of one
22 last thing.  I told you during my opening statement that there
23 were four key points, four key points, about the evidence you
24 would hear that summarized all of the evidence you would hear
25 about Fred Jacobson, and I told you that those four key points

1 were all that you needed to know to decide the issues in this
2 case.  And I've now put on the board.  You heard about all
3 this during the course of the trial.
4          Number 1:  Fred Jacobson knew that smoking was
5 dangerous and potentially addictive for many years before he
6 developed lung cancer.
7          Number 2:  Fred Jacobson enjoyed smoking cigarettes
8 and he did not want people pestering him to quit doing
9 something that he enjoyed.
10          Number 3:  When he was motivated to quit,
11 Mr. Jacobson quit smoking several times for more than a year,
12 and he finally quit for good in December of 1996, before he
13 was diagnosed with lung cancer.
14          And finally, ladies and gentlemen:  Mr. Jacobson did
15 not have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and
16 he certainly didn't have it before November 21, 1996.
17          Now, let me show you the timeline one more time.
18 This is the very same timeline out of the same series of four
19 boards that I showed you during my opening statement, and you
20 heard about all of this during the course of the trial.
21          You know, ladies and gentlemen, Fred Jacobson was
22 born on May 6, 1943, in Queens, New York.  His father, William
23 Jacobson, was a dentist.  His mother, Dorothy Jacobson, was a
24 homemaker.  He had an old sister, Lois Jacobson.  She was born
25 four years before him.  You know that Fred Jacobson was raised

1 by loving parents who placed a premium on educating their
2 children.
3          We move into the early 1950s.  You heard he was
4 diagnosed with asthma.  His sister told you, his sister told
5 you, that he was allergic to many things and many things
6 caused him to have asthmatic reactions.
7          You've also now seen the medical records and you've
8 heard the testimony of Dr. Feinberg and Dr. Frazier, Fred
9 Jacobson continued to have bouts of intermittent asthma as an
10 adult.
11          Now, let's drop from this point below the gray bar.
12 And remember, Mr. Kaiser said it again today.  He said to you
13 that Philip Morris and Lorillard somehow hid the fact that
14 cigarette smoking was dangerous and addictive for more than 50
15 years and that the American public didn't know that cigarette
16 smoking was dangerous or addictive.  And he brought you
17 Dr. Proctor.  But after hearing Dr. Proctor and all the other
18 witnesses testify, you know that is simply not the case.
19          You heard that as far back as the mid to late 1800s,
20 before Philip Morris even existed as a company, people in this
21 country were smoking what's called roll-your-own or hand-
22 rolled cigarettes.  Dr. Proctor told you those cigarettes were
23 inhalable and they were just as addictive and dangerous as
24 manufactured cigarettes.
25          I heard Mr. Kaiser refer to flue-curing.  Remember

1 what Dr. Proctor told you.  He told you long before flue-cured
2 tobacco was being used, people smoked Turkish tobacco,
3 cigarettes made of Turkish tobacco.  They were inhalable as
4 far back as the 1850s.
5          He told you in other countries, Cuba and in other
6 countries in South America, they smoked cigarettes made out of
7 something called black tobacco.  Those cigarettes also are
8 inhalable and cause the same lung cancer and diseases that
9 flue-cured tobacco causes.  That's what you heard from their
10 expert, Dr. Proctor.
11          What else did Dr. Proctor tell you?  Dr. Proctor told
12 you before Fred Jacobson was even born, people in this country
13 referred to cigarettes as coffin nails, meaning every
14 cigarette you smoke is another nail in your coffin.  He said
15 they referred to cigarettes as cancer sticks.  They referred
16 to cigarette smokers as nicotine fiends.  These were terms
17 that were introduced more than a hundred years ago, long
18 before Fred Jacobson was ever born.  You heard that Fred
19 Jacobson's family and friends heard cigarettes referred to as
20 coffin nails and cancer sticks by at least the early 1950s.
21          You also saw that popular magazines, like Reader's
22 Digest, published articles in the 1930s and 1940s that talked
23 about the health risks of smoking and the addictive nature of
24 smoking.  This wasn't hidden.  This was not some secret.
25 Dr. Proctor told you that Reader's Digest was the most popular

1 magazine in this country in the '30, '40s and 1950s.
2          He told you that as we moved into the early 1950s,
3 some of the early scientific research is being conducted that
4 specifically links cigarette smoking with what?  Lung cancer,
5 lung cancer.  This was front page news on newspapers and
6 magazines throughout the country.  So widely covered was this
7 information that Dr. Proctor told you, by 1954, when Fred
8 Jacobson was 10 or 11 years old, 90 percent of the people in
9 this country had heard that cigarette smoking was a cause of
10 lung cancer, 90 percent.
11          Now, let's go back up above the gray bar.  You heard
12 in this period of time, in the mid 1950s, Fred Jacobson's
13 mother, his father and his older sister, Lois, all smoked
14 cigarettes.  You heard that many of his friends were
15 experimenting with cigarettes.  So it's no surprise, ladies
16 and gentlemen, that Fred Jacobson himself later becomes a
17 cigarette smoker.
18          Dr. Proctor told you, Dr. Proctor told you that many
19 people begin to smoke, they're more likely to smoke, if their
20 friends and family also smoke cigarettes.
21          So we move into the mid to late 1950s, and about
22 1957, you heard from his friend, Alan Weidberg, Fred Jacobson
23 tries cigarettes for the first time.
24          What else did Mr. Weidberg tell you?  He told you
25 that many of their friends were experimenting with cigarettes.

1 He also told you, you know what, we knew, we knew we should
2 not be smoking.  Our parents told us we should not be smoking,
3 but we smoked anyway.  That's what you heard from Alan
4 Weidberg.
5          Now, about two years later, you heard that Fred
6 Jacobson attends a private high school in Manhattan called
7 Roads Prep.  He begins to read the New York Times newspaper to
8 and from school on the subway every single day.  You heard
9 from his wife that he was a voracious reader and he reads the
10 newspaper every single day for the rest of his life.
11          He graduates high school in about 1961, and a year
12 later, in 1962, he tries to enlist in the Army and he's
13 rejected by the military because of his asthma.  And how do we
14 know that, ladies and gentlemen?  We do know that.  We know
15 that because that's exactly what Fred Jacobson wrote in the
16 life insurance application he filled out years later in 1991.
17 That's how we know that.
18          He starts working on Wall Street for a couple of
19 years, and then in about 1964 or 1965 he's hired as a salesman
20 for a company called Superior Linen Company.  You heard that
21 he rose through the ranks of that company very, very quickly
22 and he ultimately becomes a senior executive.
23          Now, that brings us to 1964, and let's drop below the
24 gray bar here, and we're in January of 1964.  You heard that
25 in January of 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States

1 issues a landmark report on smoking and health.  That report
2 concludes cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and chronic
3 bronchitis.  And you now know chronic bronchitis is a type of
4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5          Now, Dr. Proctor told you that this report was front
6 page news on newspapers across the country, including New York
7 where Fred Jacobson was living.  This is the front page of the
8 New York Times on January 12, 1964, the day after the Surgeon
9 General's Report is released.  Here's what it says:
10 "Cigarettes peril health.  U.S. report concludes remedial
11 action urged."  This is what is being said in newspapers
12 across this country nearly 50 years ago in 1964.
13          You also heard that this report was the lead news
14 story on every television station:  ABC, NBC, and CBS.  We
15 showed you the special broadcast from CBS and the coverage by
16 Harry Reasoner.
17          Mr. Jacobson was 20 years old when this report was
18 released.  His friend, Alan Weidberg, his good childhood
19 friend, told you it was scary when this report was released.
20 He told you that within his circle of friends, which included
21 Fred Jacobson, they all knew that cigarette smoking caused
22 lung cancer.  That's in 1964.
23          So, let's move forward.  That brings us to 1966, two
24 years later.  We're still below the gray bar here.  In 1966,
25 Congress passes a law which requires a warning label to appear

1 on every pack of cigarettes.  That warning reads:  "Caution:
2 Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health."  This
3 warning label appears on all cigarette packs when Fred
4 Jacobson is 22 years old.  And from this point forward, every
5 pack of cigarettes he buys carries a Government mandated
6 warning that tells him cigarette smoking is hazardous to his
7 health.
8          Now, you heard Mr. Kaiser talk about an FTC report.
9 Well, ladies and gentlemen, what did Fred Jacobson's family
10 and friends tell you about the impact that this warning label
11 had?  Alan Weidberg told you, when he saw this, it caused him
12 to take notice and to think twice, think twice about the
13 possibility that if he smoked he could get sick from cigarette
14 smoking.
15          You heard from his good friend, Dr. Michael Weiner.
16 He told you he quit around the same period of time, 1965,
17 1966, because of all of the information that was out there
18 about cigarette smoking and disease.
19          And finally, what did Ronnie Jacobson herself tell
20 you?  She recalled this warning and in her deposition she
21 remembered the language of this warning nearly word for word
22 almost 50 years later.  That's what the people who knew Fred
23 Jacobson told you about that warning.
24          Now, let's go above the gray bar here.  That same
25 year, in 1966, you heard that Fred Jacobson meets his first

1 wife, Bonnie Shulman.  They got married a year later, in
2 1967.  Two years later, in about 1969 or 1970, they move to
3 Miami.  Fred Jacobson is transferred to Miami by his company,
4 Superior Linen, because they want him to help expand their
5 sales throughout the state of Florida.
6          Now, let's move from here to below the gray bar.  In
7 1970, Congress changes the warning label on cigarettes.  It
8 now says:  "Warning:  The Surgeon General has determined that
9 cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health."  That's the
10 warning as of 1970.
11          One year later, in 1971, all cigarette advertisements
12 are taken off of television and radio, as of 1971.
13          One year later, in 1972, every ad in the newspaper or
14 magazine or billboard is required to carry this Surgeon
15 General's warning.  That's the information that was out there,
16 ladies and gentlemen.
17          The plaintiff would have you believe that these
18 warnings and health messages were being drowned out by
19 statements made by cigarette companies.  But the evidence
20 you've heard has demonstrated just the opposite.
21          Remember what Dr. Proctor told you, Dr. Proctor, the
22 plaintiff's historian.  There we go.  I put it on the screen
23 in front of you.
24          We asked Dr. Proctor all about this.  He told you
25 that as of 1970, 13 million Americans had quit smoking, in the

1 four-year period from the time this warning went on until
2 1970.  He told you that between 1964 and 1979, from the first
3 Surgeon General's Report, 30 million Americans quit smoking.
4 That's two million people every single year.
5          He told you that as of today, fifty-five to
6 sixty million Americans have quit smoking.  He said the
7 Surgeon General called this a revolutionary change in health
8 behavior.
9          The people who quit smoking heard the same
10 information as Fred Jacobson.  It may have taken many of them
11 more than one try to quit.  But many make the choice to quit
12 and they quit for good, but not Fred Jacobson.  Fred Jacobson
13 enjoys smoking and at this point in time he's not interested
14 in quitting.
15          Now, shortly after moving to Miami in 1970, you heard
16 his daughter, Jennifer Dill, is born in 1970.  Two years
17 later, his son, Jeffrey Jacobson, is born in 1972.
18          You heard that the Jacobsons live in Kendall Lakes.
19 They're part of the social group that includes lots of other
20 young and educated professionals, including doctors.
21          One of their good friends and neighbors is a doctor
22 by the name of Dr. Michael Weiner.  We read his deposition to
23 you.  He told you that he told Fred Jacobson, when they met in
24 the early 1970s, that cigarette smoking is dangerous and you
25 need to quit.  That's what he told Fred Jacobson.

1          Did Fred Jacobson respond by saying, you know what,
2 I'm not convinced; I don't think so; I don't believe that
3 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?  Of course he didn't.
4 Dr. Weiner told you that based on what Mr. Jacobson told him,
5 it was clear Fred Jacobson knew all of this long before they
6 had those conversations, long before they had had those
7 conversations.
8          What did you hear from Fred Jacobson's children
9 themselves?  They told you that they were both well aware that
10 cigarette smoking was bad for their health at a very young
11 age.  They begin to urge their father to quit smoking in the
12 mid to late 1970s because that's what they are being taught in
13 school.
14          You heard that Jennifer and Jeff bought their father
15 a sign at a school bake sale.  That sign said:  "Thank you for
16 not smoking."  "Thank you for not smoking."
17          And you'll recall Jennifer Jacobson's testimony about
18 this.  This is what was played to you.  Jennifer Jacobson was
19 asked the following questions, ladies and gentlemen:
20          What is the youngest age at which that was something
21 that you knew, "that" meaning that cigarette smoking is bad
22 for your health?
23          Her answer was:  Maybe 8 or 9 years old.
24          The next question is:  When you bought that thank you
25 for not smoking sign for your father, at that point in time

1 did you already know that cigarettes could be bad for you and
2 could kill you?
3          Her answer:  I believe so.  I believe so.
4          So she's eight or nine years old.
5          You heard Jennifer Dill testify that her teacher in
6 school showed her a pair of pink healthy lungs of a nonsmoker
7 and the brown and diseased lungs of a longtime heavy cigarette
8 smoker.  Jennifer Dill said that was a very vivid
9 demonstration of the health risks of smoking.  That's what she
10 told you.
11          You heard that she draws her father a birthday card.
12 She draws a brown heart on the birthday card and she tells her
13 father, please stop smoking, daddy.  I want you to be
14 healthy.  That's what his daughter tells him in the late
15 1970s.
16          You've heard from Dr. Proctor that it was part of the
17 curriculum of the school system, the public school system here
18 in Miami-Dade County, that children, elementary school
19 children, were taught the health risks of smoking.  And
20 Jeffrey and Jennifer Jacobson Dill all confirm that to you.
21 They confirm that to you.
22          In fact, you know that Mrs. Jacobson, Ronnie Jacobson
23 herself, was an elementary school teacher right here during
24 the same period of time in the 1970s in Miami-Dade County.
25          Now, let's move forward to the early 1980s.  You

1 heard that in 1982, Fred Jacobson's first wife, Bonnie
2 Jacobson, is diagnosed with leukemia.  She's treated for about
3 a two-year period, but unfortunately she passes away in
4 November of 1983.  She's treated by a doctor named Alan
5 Feinberg.  That's the same doctor who ultimately treats Fred
6 Jacobson when he's diagnosed with lung cancer many years
7 later.  While he's treating Bonnie Jacobson for leukemia, he
8 tells Fred Jacobson cigarette smoking is bad for your health;
9 you need to quit.
10          And you know what?  Fred Jacobson does quite smoking
11 at this point in time.  He quits for approximately one year.
12 And how do we know that?  We know that because that's what
13 Fred Jacobson tells his own doctor.
14          You've seen the record before.  Let me show it to you
15 again.  This is a June 30, 1988, medical record written by
16 Dr. Morton Korn.  Dr. Korn was Fred Jacobson's primary care
17 physician.  You'll remember Mrs. Jacobson told you he was my
18 doctor first and I recommended that Fred Jacobson go to see
19 him.
20          Well, he has an appointment in 1988.  The first time
21 he sees Dr. Korn, Dr. Korn asks him if he smokes cigarettes,
22 and here is what Fred Jacobson tells Dr. Korn.  Unfortunately,
23 he smokes cigarettes.  He had stopped for one year when his
24 first wife died and then unfortunately he went back to it.
25 That's what Dr. Korn wrote that's what Fred Jacobson told

1 him.  So in 1988, Fred Jacobson tells his doctor that he quit
2 for about a year in 1982 or 1983, when his wife was diagnosed
3 with leukemia and passed away.
4          Now, I heard Mr. Kaiser say this.  Mrs. Jacobson and
5 her lawyers want to suggest to you that somehow this record is
6 not accurate.  But Mrs. Jacobson herself told you she knows
7 nothing about her husband's cigarette smoking before they met
8 in 1984.  She also told you it is difficult for her to
9 remember these things because it's almost 30 years ago.
10          You now know, after listening to all the evidence in
11 this case, that what Fred Jacobson told his doctor in 1988 is
12 far more reliable than Mrs. Jacobson's memory of what occurred
13 30 years ago.  You know that, ladies and gentlemen.
14          Now, we know that at some point, about a year later,
15 Fred Jacobson decides to start smoking again.  What do we know
16 specifically?  We know that his first wife, Bonnie Shulman,
17 was a nonsmoker.  Less than two months after she passes away
18 in November 1983, Fred Jacobson meets the plaintiff.  She was
19 known as Ronnie Jackowitz at that point.  You heard they hit
20 it off immediately, they begin dating, and less than six
21 months later they're married.
22          Ronnie Jacobson herself told you I enjoyed smoking
23 cigarettes.  She told you that during her testimony.  And it
24 certainly makes sense that at least one of the reasons why
25 Fred Jacobson would decide to start smoking again is because

1 he's now dating a woman who enjoys smoking cigarettes just
2 like he does.
3          Now, Mrs. Jacobson refused to admit to you when she
4 testified that her husband enjoyed smoking.  But ladies and
5 gentlemen, Judge Ungaro is going to tell you, you get to use
6 your common sense.  You can use your common sense.  You heard
7 the testimony.  You saw the pictures.  There is no doubt that
8 Fred Jacobson and Ronnie Jacobson enjoyed smoking cigarettes.
9 They enjoyed smoking together.  Mrs. Jacobson had to admit
10 that to you.
11          Their own witness, Dr. Proctor, told you a person is
12 more likely to smoke and less likely to want to quit if their
13 spouse also smokes cigarettes.  That's what their own doctor,
14 Dr. Proctor, told you.
15          Now, let's move forward.  We're in 1985 here.  We're
16 below the gray bar.  In 1985, Congress changes the warning
17 label on cigarettes again.  There's now a series of four
18 rotating warnings.  One of those warnings says:  "Surgeon
19 General's warning:  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease,
20 emphysema and may complicate pregnancy."  That's in 1985.
21          Let's move to the late 1980s.  We know that in either
22 1989 or 1990, Fred Jacobson quits smoking for several years.
23 How do we know that?  Because that's what Fred Jacobson tells
24 us in a life insurance application that he fills out in May of
25 1991.

1          You've seen this life insurance application before.
2 It's in evidence.  Fred Jacobson signs this.  He signs the
3 document in May of 1991, Jackson Mutual Life Insurance
4 application.  He's asked a very simple question:  Have you
5 smoked cigarettes in the past 12 months?  He checks the box
6 that says no, I haven't smoked cigarettes in the past 12
7 months.
8          There's another page of the application where he's
9 asked a very similar question too.  Again, this is signed by
10 Fred Jacobson.  He's asked:  Has any person proposed for
11 insurance smoked cigarettes within the last 12 months?  He
12 writes or he checks the box no, and then he tells the
13 insurance agent:  Quit several years ago.  Fred Jacobson
14 indicates on this life insurance application that he quit
15 several years ago.
16          So, sometime in 1989 or 1990, Mr. Jacobson quits
17 smoking again for several years.  But this is another record,
18 ladies and gentlemen, another record that Mrs. Jacobson and
19 her lawyers in this lawsuit want to tell you is just wrong,
20 just wrong.
21          She tells you she remembers this is wrong from the
22 late '80s, early '90s, when remember, she couldn't even
23 husband that her husband quit smoking for good in 1996 just a
24 few months ago in her deposition.
25          But think about what Mrs. Jacobson and her lawyers

1 are really saying when they tell you this record is wrong.
2 She is saying that she and her husband made a false statement
3 under penalty of perjury.  To save what?  A few hundred
4 dollars on a life insurance premium?  That's what she is
5 saying at the same time that she and her lawyers are now
6 asking you to award her millions of dollars, millions of
7 dollars.
8          You heard that Fred Jacobson made a comfortable
9 living.  They went out to dinner several times a week.  They
10 went on many cruises.  After everything you've heard about
11 Fred Jacobson during this trial, there's absolutely no reason
12 to believe that he would have put false information in this
13 application to save a few bucks.
14          The fact of the matter is, Mrs. Jacobson doesn't
15 remember when or for how long her husband quit smoking over
16 the years.  Take a look at the document.  Page through the
17 document.  You'll see the life insurance company has a doctor
18 perform a physical exam on Fred Jacobson.  They take a blood
19 sample.  They take a urine sample.
20          So, ladies and gentlemen, consider the source of the
21 evidence:  An application that's filled out by Fred Jacobson
22 and signed under penalty of perjury by Fred Jacobson many
23 years before anyone was thinking about filing a lawsuit versus
24 the testimony of someone who has a financial interest in
25 remembering things that are helpful to her case and is asking

1 you to award her millions of dollars in damages in this case.
2          Now, that brings to us 1996.  And one of the
3 questions you're going to be asked to decide is whether or not
4 Fred Jacobson had COPD on or before November 21, 1996.  I'm
5 going to talk about that, but I'm going to talk about that
6 when we get to the question on the verdict form in just a
7 moment.
8          So that brings us to December 17, 1996.  And on that
9 day, Fred Jacobson quits smoking for good.  And again, we know
10 that because that is what Fred Jacobson said in his own health
11 insurance -- or, excuse me, patient health history
12 questionnaire.  You've seen this document.  I'm highlighting
13 the passage.  We've highlighted -- this is filled out by Fred
14 Jacobson himself in his own handwriting.
15          Under tobacco use he says he smoked one pack of
16 cigarettes a day for 35 years.  And at the very bottom he
17 says:  If you have stopped smoking, when?  He says:  December
18 17, 1996.
19          And Mrs. Jacobson, when this was presented to her,
20 said, yes, I agree, that's when he quit.  That's when he
21 quit.  Mrs. Jacobson acknowledged that her husband simply said
22 enough is enough and made the decision to quit.
23          And as you heard, when he quit smoking for good in
24 1996, he did it without any assistance whatsoever, with no
25 serious withdrawal, and apparently with little difficulty.  It

1 was such not a big deal that Mrs. Jacobson didn't even
2 remember that this is when he quit when she gave her
3 deposition just a few months ago.
4          Now, that brings us to May of 1997.  You heard that
5 while working in his backyard, Fred Jacobson has a sudden
6 onset of shortness of breath and cough.  Mrs. Jacobson
7 testified this is the very first time, the very first time he
8 ever had any breathing difficulties that she's aware of.  And
9 look at the date compared to this date.
10          He immediately goes to the doctor.  They find that he
11 has a large tumor in his chest, and unfortunately, he's
12 diagnosed with lung cancer.
13          You heard that he does reasonably well for the next
14 three years, and despite aggressive treatment, there is
15 ultimately a recurrence of the cancer and he passes away in
16 February of 2001.
17          Ladies and gentlemen, that's the story.  That's the
18 entire story you have heard about Fred Jacobson during the
19 course of this trial.
20          Now, what I would like to do with the time I have
21 remaining is walk you through the specific questions that
22 you're going to be asked to decide on the verdict form, and
23 let's start with the very first question, that question that
24 we've talked about several times.
25          Question number 1 says -- can you all read that from

1 there or I do need to move it closer?  I'm going to move it a
2 little bit closer.  I saw somebody leaning in a little bit
3 over there.
4          The question is:  Did Fredric Jacobson have chronic
5 obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and, if so, did his COPD
6 first manifest itself on or before November 21, 1996?
7          And this word "manifest" simply means did it exist,
8 did it appear, did it occur --
9          MR. FINGER:  Your Honor, I'm objecting.  That is not
10 the verdict form that this jury is getting.
11          THE COURT:  I can't see it.  So I don't know.
12          MR. FINGER:  That's not the question.
13          THE COURT:  But we've made the verdict form available
14 to everyone.  So the first question is:  Did Fredric Jacobson
15 have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and, if so, did
16 his COPD first manifest itself on or before November 21, 1996?
17          MR. GERAGHTY:  That's exactly what I have.
18          THE COURT:  I just read from the verdict form.
19          MR. FINGER:  All right.  I have trouble seeing it
20 from a distance.  I'm sorry.
21          THE COURT:  Well --
22          MR. GERAGHTY:  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the
23 question you're going to be asked to decide on the verdict
24 form.  You'll see the verdict form.
25          Now, I'm sure it must have seemed odd that in a case

1 in which it is undisputed that Fred Jacobson died of lung
2 cancer, that the parties spent so much time talking to you
3 about COPD and emphysema.  So let me see if I can explain that
4 to you.
5          The Judge is going to tell you in her instructions
6 that the plaintiff wants to take advantage of certain
7 procedural benefits, benefits that enabled her to file this
8 lawsuit and benefits that relieve her of the obligation to
9 prove certain things that she would otherwise have to prove.
10 But she's only entitled to do that if she can prove that Fred
11 Jacobson had a qualifying disease, and that qualifying disease
12 is COPD.  So, Mrs. Jacobson has the burden to prove to you by
13 a preponderance of the evidence that her husband had COPD on
14 or before November 21, 1996.
15          If you answer "no" to this question, if you answer
16 "no," your verdict is for the defendants, the case is over
17 and we all go home.
18          So, let's talk about the evidence that you heard.
19 And I told you in my opening statement, I told you in my
20 opening statement, that the plaintiff would base her entire
21 argument that Fred Jacobson had COPD on or before November 21,
22 1996, on this single medical record from Dr. Neil Schneider.
23          You now know, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the
24 only medical record of Dr. Schneider's that Mrs. Jacobson and
25 her lawyers asked him to keep after all of his other records

1 were destroyed.  You heard that after they asked him to keep
2 this record, all of his other records were destroyed.  You
3 have to ask yourself why was that so.  There is no good
4 explanation for that in this case, ladies and gentlemen.
5          So, all of the other evidence, all of the other
6 evidence in this case points to the fact that Fred Jacobson
7 did not have COPD, and he certainly did not have it on or
8 before November 21, 1996.
9          So, let's talk about Dr. Schneider's record first.  I
10 told you that Dr. Schneider would tell you that he made a
11 tentative diagnosis of COPD, a tentative diagnosis, and that's
12 exactly what Dr. Schneider said when he testified.
13          I've put the testimony now in front of you.  This is
14 Dr. Schneider's testimony.  I asked him the following
15 question:
16          Isn't it true that you said you made a tentative
17 diagnosis of COPD when you gave your deposition in this
18 case -- which you know is under oath testimony -- back in May,
19 just a few months ago?
20          His answer was:  Yes.
21          I then repeated it:  That was the words that you used
22 was "tentative diagnosis"?
23          Dr. Schneider said:  Yes.
24          Remember what else what Dr. Schneider told you.  You
25 heard that a "tentative diagnosis" means uncertain.  He was

1 not sure.
2          And what else did Dr. Schneider tell you about the
3 examination that he performed on April 24, 1996?  He told you
4 the entire examination was 100 percent normal.  The history,
5 the physical exam, his examination of Mr. Jacobson's lungs,
6 the chest x-ray, 100 percent normal.
7          So, what other evidence did you hear on this issue?
8 I tried to summarize the evidence you've heard on this board.
9 This is all the evidence that conclusively establishes he did
10 not have COPD and he didn't have it on or before November 21,
11 1996.
12          So, let's start with number 1.  It is undisputed Fred
13 Jacobson did not have any symptoms, no symptoms of COPD or
14 emphysema, on or before November 21, 1996.  And we know that
15 because Mrs. Jacobson told you that in her testimony right
16 during the course of this trial.
17          Here's her testimony.  I asked her the following
18 questions:
19          The bottom line is, before he was diagnosed with
20 cancer, you never saw him experience any breathing
21 difficulties of any kind?
22          His answer -- her answer, excuse me:  Correct.
23          And you don't recall him ever being treated for
24 emphysema or COPD?
25          Her answer:  No.

1          And you don't recall him taking any kind of
2 medications for COPD or emphysema, right?
3          Her answer:  Correct.
4          That was Ronnie Jacobson's testimony.  Her husband
5 had no breathing problems before November 21, 1996.
6          So, second, you now heard that Dr. Feinberg, his
7 oncologist, and three pulmonologists never diagnosed Fred
8 Jacobson with COPD or emphysema.  None of them diagnosed him
9 with that.
10          You've now heard, ladies and gentlemen, that Fred
11 Jacobson was treated by three different pulmonologists,
12 doctors who specialize in diagnosing COPD and emphysema.  You
13 heard about Dr. Bruce Krieger, you heard about a Dr. Latanae
14 Parker, and you heard about a Dr. Louis Gidel.
15          Here is Dr. Feinberg's testimony on this point.  I
16 asked Dr. Feinberg these questions.
17          Question:  During the period of time that you treated
18 Mr. Jacobson, that three-year period, he was evaluated by
19 three separate pulmonologists, right?
20          His answer:  At least.
21          The next question:  All right.  And we could go back
22 and look at their notes, but none of these three
23 pulmonologists ever diagnosed Fred Jacobson with either
24 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema, isn't that
25 right?

1          His answer is:  On clinical examination, no, they did
2 not diagnose him.
3          Mr. Kaiser and Mr. Finger can pull out references
4 where people say they suspect COPD, they say something is
5 suspicious of emphysema or consistent with emphysema.  Find
6 the medical record, find the medical record where a single
7 doctor diagnosed Fred Jacobson with COPD.  It doesn't exist.
8          You heard about this dr. Louis Gidel.  His final
9 diagnosis was asthmatic bronchitis.  And the Judge is going to
10 tell you asthma and asthmatic bronchitis are not qualifying
11 diseases.  They're not qualifying diseases.  They are not
12 caused by cigarette smoking.
13          Dr. Feinberg himself told you he didn't diagnose Fred
14 Jacobson with COPD or emphysema at any point during the three
15 years he treated him.
16          This Dr. Feinberg's testimony:
17          You never diagnosed Fred Jacobson with either chronic
18 obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema, isn't the true?
19          His answer is:  I -- no, I did not make a diagnosis
20 of that.
21          Don't you think if any of these other pulmonologists
22 from Miami had diagnosed Fred Jacobson with COPD or emphysema,
23 the plaintiff would have him here in this courtroom and they
24 would tell you that from that witness stand?  Dr. Krieger,
25 Dr. Latanae Parker, Dr. Gidel, they didn't testify.  They

1 didn't testify because they didn't diagnose Fred Jacobson with
2 COPD and the plaintiff knows that.  That's why you didn't hear
3 any of those doctors testify.
4          Now, third, ladies and gentlemen, you heard Fred
5 Jacobson had intermittent asthma, intermittent asthma.
6          We presented the testimony of Dr. William Frazier.
7 He's a Board-certified lung specialist, the only
8 pulmonologist, the only doctor you heard from during this
9 entire trial who treats people for COPD and emphysema.  He
10 walked you through all of the medical records.  He showed you
11 all of the pulmonary function tests.
12          He told you that Fred Jacobson had mild obstruction
13 but that that obstruction improved significantly -- the word
14 he used was it reversed -- it reversed when Fred Jacobson was
15 given that medication called a bronchodilator and he repeated
16 the pulmonary function tests again.
17          Mr. Kaiser can pull statements out of these things
18 and tell you he thinks they know what they mean.  But you
19 didn't hear a single doctor support any of the things that
20 Mr. Kaiser told you.
21          Dr. Frazier came in.  He explained it all told you.
22 He told you that the pulmonary function tests were a sure sign
23 that Fred Jacobson had asthma.  He said he didn't have
24 emphysema or COPD.
25          Now, you know that many of the records in the case

1 show that Fred Jacobson continued to have bouts of
2 intermittent asthma as an adult.  Here's Dr. Korn's record.
3 You saw this records just a moment ago.  I highlighted another
4 passage.  But this is Dr. Korn in 1998.  He writes -- this is
5 Fred Jacobson, tells him these things.  That's the only way
6 Dr. Korn gets the information.  He says:  He had childhood
7 asthma and occasionally he does wheeze.  When he wheezes, he
8 has some shortness of breath, and then he writes further down
9 he wheezes occasionally.  This is in 1988, when Fred Jacobson
10 is 45 years old.  He's 45 years old.
11          Here's another record.  I don't believe this was
12 discussed during any of the testimony.  But this is the record
13 from Dr. Latanae Parker.  He's a pulmonologist, a
14 pulmonologist who treated Fred Jacobson for intermittent
15 breathing problems in November of 1997 at Baptist Hospital.
16 And what does Dr. Latanae Parker write:  It is possible that
17 he could have a recurrence of his underlying childhood
18 asthma.
19          Dr. Frazier explained that to you.  He explained the
20 whole thing to you.  Dr. Parker does not diagnose Fred
21 Jacobson with COPD or emphysema.  Ask Mr. Kaiser and
22 Mr. Finger to show you the record.  They can't because there
23 is no such record.  It doesn't exist because it didn't
24 happen.
25          Now, finally, ladies and gentlemen, the most

1 persuasive evidence that Fred Jacobson did not have COPD or
2 emphysema is that neither he nor Mrs. Jacobson ever believed
3 that he had COPD or emphysema.
4          Let me remind you what Dr. Schneider told you.  Let's
5 go back to Dr. Schneider's testimony.  Dr. Schneider told you
6 that if he did in fact make a definitive diagnosis of COPD
7 back in 1996, what did he tell you he would have done?  He
8 said, I would have sat Mr. and Mrs. Jacobson down.  I would
9 have explained the results of the tests and told him you have
10 emphysema, and he said I would have done that because that's
11 the way medicine is practiced in this country.
12          Here is Dr. Schneider's testimony.  He here's the
13 question I asked him:
14          Are you telling us, then, that if you did in fact,
15 definitively diagnose Fred Jacobson with mild COPD on April
16 24, 1996, you would have sat him down, showed him the test
17 results, and explained to him the significance of what those
18 test results were?
19          His answer was:  I would have showed him the test
20 results, yes.
21          That is what Dr. Schneider told you.
22          And Ronnie Jacobson herself claims, she claims she
23 remembers this conversation.  She says, yes, he did tell us
24 that Fred Jacobson had emphysema.  Here is her testimony.
25 This is Ronnie Jacobson during the trial.

1          I asked her:
2          So, Dr. Schneider told you and your husband in April
3 of 1996 that he had emphysema or COPD?
4          Her answer:  Correct.
5          I asked her again:  You're sure about that?
6          Her answer:  Correct.
7          That's what Ronnie Jacobson said.
8          So, she claims she remembers this conversation taking
9 place in April of 1996, when again, ladies and gentlemen, she
10 couldn't remember that her husband quit smoking for good just
11 several months later.  That's her testimony.
12          So, what evidence did you hear?  Neither Fred nor
13 Ronnie Jacobson ever told a single doctor, a single doctor,
14 that he had emphysema or COPD, despite the fact that you now
15 know that they had dozens of medical appointments with many,
16 many doctors over the next four years.
17          So, let's go through the records very carefully.  I
18 didn't blow this particular record up, but you saw it several
19 times.  You know that the first time Fred Jacobson saw
20 Dr. Feinberg was on June 18, 1997.  This record is in
21 evidence.  This is the first time he went to see Dr. Feinberg
22 about his lung cancer.
23          Ronnie Jacobson told you, we never told Dr. Feinberg
24 that Fred Jacobson had COPD or emphysema.  And you can look
25 through the record.  There's not a mention of it, not a

1 mention of it.  That's June of 1997.
2          Three months later, remember, three months later, in
3 September -- I'm going to move this down here -- you'll recall
4 that three months later, in September of 1997, Mr. and Mrs.
5 Jacobson went to Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston for
6 him to have a second opinion about the treatment for his lung
7 cancer, and Ronnie Jacobson told you this was a serious
8 matter.  It was life and death.  Fred Jacobson filled out a
9 Patient Health History Form.  Mrs. Jacobson told you this was
10 in his own handwriting.
11          Fred Jacobson was asked specifically, do you have
12 emphysema.  He said, I didn't have emphysema.  He leaves it
13 blank.  But what does he check?  He checks the box that says
14 allergies or asthma.
15          So Fred Jacobson remembers being diagnosed with
16 allergies and asthma as a young boy in the '50s, but he
17 doesn't remember that his primary care doctor told him he had
18 emphysema a year earlier?  Ask yourself if that makes any
19 sense, ladies and gentlemen.  Does that make any sense?
20          Six months later, you heard that Fred Jacobson fills
21 out a Social Security disability application.  We showed you
22 that application during Mrs. Jacobson's testimony.  He was
23 asked about all of the medical conditions he had never been
24 diagnosed with.  He puts a laundry list of things in this
25 answer.  This is in his own handwriting.  He even mentions

1 that he has high cholesterol and that he has an itching
2 condition.  But anywhere in this application does he say I've
3 been diagnosed with emphysema or COPD?  Of course not, because
4 he hadn't, ladies and gentlemen.
5          Finally, I'm going to show you one more.  This is
6 June 6, 2000.  This is when he's admitted to the hospital by
7 Dr. Feinberg.  Dr. Feinberg has been treating him now for
8 three years.  He knows his past medical history extremely
9 well.  He actually asks him, he asks, have you ever been
10 diagnosed with COPD or emphysema.  He asks Ronnie Jacobson and
11 Fred Jacobson that question.
12          What do they tell him?  Here's what Dr. Feinberg
13 writes:  He has a history of tobacco abuse but no history of
14 any chronic lung disease.  His wife stated that there was a
15 history of asthmatic bronchitis in the past.
16          Dr. Feinberg asked them the question point-blank, and
17 they tell him, no history of any chronic lung disease.
18          And what does Ronnie Jacobson tell him?  He has
19 asthmatic bronchitis, asthmatic bronchitis, which is not a
20 qualifying disease in this case.
21          Now, ultimately, Mrs. Jacobson had to acknowledge at
22 the end of my cross-examination of her that she never told a
23 single person, not one of his doctors, that he had COPD or
24 emphysema while he was alive.  This is Ronnie Jacobson's
25 testimony under oath before you about a week and a half ago,

1 ladies and gentlemen.
2          I asked her:  Now, ma'am, isn't it true that while
3 your husband was alive, you never told anyone, anyone, not any
4 of your family members, not doctors, that Fred Jacobson had
5 emphysema or COPD?  Isn't that right?
6          Her answer:  Correct.
7          That was her testimony under oath in this case.  But
8 her lawyers stand up and tell you the answer to this question
9 ought to be yes.
10          So, despite claiming that Dr. Schneider told her and
11 her husband in 1996 that he had emphysema, she never told a
12 single person, not one of his doctors, that he had it.  And
13 the reason, ladies and gentlemen, she never told anyone that
14 Fred Jacobson had COPD is because he didn't have it.  The
15 conversation with Dr. Schneider never took place.  He had
16 asthma and asthmatic bronchitis, just like she told
17 Dr. Feinberg in June of 2000, and those are not qualifying
18 diseases, as Judge Ungaro will tell you.
19          Mrs. Jacobson knows all of this to be true, but she
20 can't admit it to you, ladies and gentlemen, because she knows
21 what the effect of that will mean for her lawsuit.
22          Remember, when her lawyers and she filed the written
23 document that started this lawsuit in this court a year ago,
24 in 2012, they didn't mention that Fred Jacobson had COPD.  You
25 think that was an oversight?

1          When Mrs. Jacobson gave her deposition under oath
2 just a few months ago, a few months before this trial, she was
3 asked by Mr. Pedrosa, did your husband have chronic
4 obstructive pulmonary disease?  Her answer was no, no.  Then
5 several hours went by.  They had breaks.  She had an
6 opportunity to talk to her lawyers, and then she comes back
7 and says, whoops, I forgot, I always knew it as COPD.  That's
8 what she said.
9          Ladies and gentlemen, the answer to this first
10 question is no, and if you answer no, the case is over and we
11 all go home.
12          Now, I'd like to talk to you about the next two
13 questions on the verdict form and I put them together because
14 they kind of go together.
15          Question number 2 says:  Was Fredric Jacobson
16 addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?
17          Yes or no.
18          And if you answer yes, the next question is:
19          Was his addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine a
20 legal cause of Fredric Jacobson's COPD?
21          Now, let's start with the first question, was Fred
22 Jacobson addicted.  And let me remind you, the Court is not
23 going to give you a definition of what it means to be addicted
24 in this case.  And I told you in my openings the plaintiff
25 would not present an expert to you, a medical expert who would

1 explain to you from a medical standpoint what it means to be
2 addicted.  Instead, you heard Mr. Kaiser refer to passages
3 from a Surgeon General's Report.
4          Well, that 1988 Surgeon General's Report actually has
5 a set of diagnosing criteria.  It's on page 249, if you want
6 to bother to look, and it talks about the fact that
7 psychiatrists, addiction medicine specialists, have a series
8 of medical criteria that they use to diagnose some long term
9 heavy cigarette smokers as addicted.
10          But the plaintiff never presented an expert to you in
11 this case and she gave you no real information to conclude
12 that her husband was addicted.  Instead, you heard from Ronnie
13 Jacobson and her two children that, in their personal opinion,
14 he was addicted.  That's it.  That's all you've heard in this
15 case.
16          Now, we read to you the deposition of Dr. Michael
17 Weiner.  He is a medical doctor and an old, old friend of Fred
18 Jacobson's.  And we read his deposition to you in part because
19 he said hey, look, I know that addiction is a medical
20 diagnosis, and even though I know Fred Jacobson smoked about a
21 pack of cigarettes a day for many years, I can't tell you
22 whether he's addicted.  That is an honest opinion coming from
23 someone who doesn't have an interest in the outcome of the
24 case.
25          So, let's focus on Mrs. Jacobson's testimony.  She

1 told you she knows her husband is addicted.  She is sure that
2 he is addicted.  But she refused to acknowledge anything,
3 anything else that might be harmful to her case that might
4 lead you to conclude that he knew the health risks and that he
5 wasn't addicted.
6          Let me remind you of some of the things that she
7 said.  She is sure that her husband was addicted.  She claims
8 he was addicted.  But remember, she told you, I don't really
9 know why my husband was trying to quit smoking.  She told you,
10 I couldn't get inside of his head.  She also told you, I don't
11 know when he quite smoking for good.  We had to remind her
12 with the medical record.
13          She also said, I don't know whether he ever discussed
14 the health risks of smoking with anyone.
15          She told you she wasn't even sure whether he ever saw
16 or read the pack warnings.  She said, I assume but I can't
17 tell you for sure whether my husband enjoyed smoking
18 cigarettes.
19          So, ladies and gentlemen, she doesn't know any of
20 these things, any of these things, but she is darn sure he was
21 addicted.
22          So, when you evaluate Mrs. Jacobson's testimony,
23 please keep the following in mind:  The same person who's
24 telling you he was addicted is asking you now to award her
25 millions of dollars.

1          She can't remember or won't acknowledge things that
2 your common sense tells you, ladies and gentlemen, a wife
3 would know about her husband.  And many of the things she's
4 told you about her husband and the cigarette smoking were
5 contradicted by what he told his own doctors and what he wrote
6 down in his own records many years before this lawsuit was
7 ever filed.
8          So, ask yourself, is that sufficient in a court of
9 law or do you believe actual evidence, tangible evidence from
10 a source that has no interest in the outcome of the case
11 should be required?  I think the answer is obvious.  The
12 plaintiff has simply failed to carry her burden to prove to
13 you that her husband was hopelessly addicted and the answer to
14 this question ought to be no, it ought to be no.
15          But even if you ultimately decide that Fred Jacobson
16 was addicted, your work is just beginning, because the
17 plaintiff has to prove more than that.  The plaintiff bears
18 the burden to prove this question by a preponderance of the
19 evidence.  They have to prove that Fred Jacobson's claimed
20 addiction was a legal cause of his so-called COPD.
21          Now, I put the instruction -- I'm going to put it up
22 here so you see what the instruction on legal cause says.  And
23 frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to read it all
24 out to you now.  It is difficult to follow, no question about
25 it.

1          I highlighted the words "directly," "substantially"
2 and "but for," because I told you those words would appear in
3 the instruction.  But to understand what this concept of legal
4 cause is all about, I think the best example is the one that I
5 gave you in my opening statement.
6          Imagine someone walks across the street and they get
7 hit by a bus.  The bus is the medical cause of why they were
8 injured.  But to understand the legal cause, you need to know
9 more than that.  Was the light green when they tried to cross
10 the street?  Was the person paying attention or were they
11 distracted?  Were they talking on their cell phone?  Were they
12 texting?  Did the person look both ways before they crossed
13 the street?  Did the person know the bus was coming and yet
14 still try to beat the bus across the street?
15          You need to know all of those things to know what
16 legal cause is in this case.
17          Now, in this case, ladies and gentlemen, the question
18 of legal cause really boils down to the issue of quitting.
19 Was Fred Jacobson's claimed addiction so strong, so
20 substantial that it prevented him from quitting?
21          Addiction is not the legal cause of Mr. Jacobson's
22 claimed COPD if you find that Fred Jacobson was capable of
23 quitting when he was motivated to do so.  Instead, it is his
24 informed decision to smoke cigarettes for many years and his
25 decision not to quit for good until it was too late.

1          We all know that Fred Jacobson could quit smoking
2 because he did quit smoking several times for more than a year
3 or two without any assistance.
4          Mr. Jacobson smoked for more than 30 years not
5 because he was forced to do so by an addiction.  He smoked
6 because he enjoyed it and for many years he had no real
7 interest in quitting.
8          Remember the testimony you heard.  He never tried a
9 nicotine patch.  He never used nicotine gum.  He never went to
10 a stop smoking clinic or class.  He never asked his doctors or
11 anyone for help in quitting.  These were all methods that were
12 available to him if he was truly motivated to quit and if, as
13 his wife would have you believe, he was struggling to quit.
14          The truth is Fred Jacobson was strong, independent
15 and intelligent and for many years he didn't listen to what
16 his friends, his family or his doctors told him when it came
17 to cigarette smoking.
18          You heard that his old friend, Alan Weidberg, told
19 him, you know what, you should quit smoking.  Fred Jacobson
20 responded, you know what, you should lose some weight.  When
21 his daughter, Jennifer, pestered him to quit, he said to her,
22 quit hawking me, Jen, quite hawking me.  Alan Weidberg, his
23 oldest and dearest friend told you, his attitude was, mind
24 your own business; let me live my life the way I want to live
25 it.

1          Mr. Jacobson demonstrated to everyone in this
2 courtroom that he was capable of quitting when he decided he
3 wanted to quit.  He quit for a year in 1982, he quit for
4 several years in 1989, and he quit for good in December of
5 1996 with no assistance, no serious withdrawal and little
6 difficulty.  And we know all of those things, ladies and
7 gentlemen, because that's what Fred Jacobson told his doctors
8 many years ago.
9          You heard Dr. Proctor tell you that fifty-five to
10 sixty million Americans, longtime cigarette smokers, have quit
11 smoking in this country.  Many of them smoked more than Fred
12 Jacobson.  The nicotine in cigarettes did not prevent these
13 people from understanding that smoking is dangerous and from
14 exercising their free will and making a decision to stop and
15 to stop for good.  And you've heard no evidence during the
16 course of this trial that Fred Jacobson was any different.
17          In fact, even Ronnie Jacobson had to admit that when
18 he quit smoking for good, it was because he decided it was
19 time to quit.  It was his decision and his decision alone.
20          The evidence shows Fred Jacobson was always in
21 control, not Philip Morris, not Lorillard, not the nicotine in
22 cigarettes.  Your answer to question number 3, ladies and
23 gentlemen, should be no, and if you answer no, the case is
24 over and we go home.
25          Now, if, however, you answer the first three or four

1 questions, yes -- I don't think you'll get that far in this
2 case, but I want to talk to you about a couple of questions
3 that appear later on the verdict form.
4          Question number 5, I put on the board here.  It's
5 going to ask you to assign a percentage of responsibility for
6 Fred Jacobson's lung cancer and death.  There's a line for
7 Fred Jacobson, a line for Philip Morris, and a line for
8 Lorillard.
9          Now, you heard Mr. Kaiser tell you that the plaintiff
10 admits that Fred Jacobson was partially responsible for his
11 own cancer and death, and the Judge is going to repeat that in
12 her instructions.
13          So, what does that mean?  It can only mean one
14 thing.  It means that Fred Jacobson knew that cigarette
15 smoking was dangerous and caused disease, and that he had the
16 ability to quit smoking in time to avoid his injury.
17 Otherwise, how could he be responsible.
18          The fact that they tell you he is partially
19 responsible is an admission that he knew the risks and he
20 could quit when he was motivated to do so.
21          You heard from his good friend, Dr. Michael Weiner.
22 He told you Fred Jacobson was not the kind of person who
23 blamed other people for the decisions he made in life.  He was
24 the kind of person who took full responsibility for his
25 actions.

1          And based on all of that, I respectfully suggest that
2 if you get to question 5, you assign 100 percent of the
3 responsibility to Fred Jacobson.  The plaintiff tells you he
4 is responsible, and that's what taking full responsibility is
5 all about, ladies and gentlemen.
6          Let me show you questions 6 and 7 on the verdict
7 form.  Now, again, I don't think you're going to get this far
8 on the verdict form.  But if you do, let me read to you
9 questions 6 and 7.  They go together.  These are the reliance
10 questions.  I'm going try to read it.  It's long.
11          Please state as to each defendant whether
12 Mr. Jacobson relied to his detriment -- I highlighted that --
13 on representations made by that defendant on or after May 5,
14 1982, that concealed or omitted material information
15 concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking
16 cigarettes, and, if so, whether such reliance was a legal
17 cause of his lung cancer and death.
18          So this concept of reliance is in here, legal cause.
19          Now, let me make three quick points, three quick
20 points about this.  If you answer yes to either question 6 or
21 7 -- I think the evidence supports the answer should be no --
22 but if you answer yes, that percentage of responsibility that
23 we just talked about with the earlier question, question 5,
24 goes out the window; and if you decide that you want to award
25 any money to Ronnie Jacobson, she keeps 100 percent of the

1 money irrespective of that assignment of responsibility.
2          Second, these questions look very similar to one
3 another.  So you may be asking yourself what's the difference
4 between the two.  Well, this question refers to each
5 defendant.  It says, please state as to each defendant whether
6 Mr. Jacobson relied to his detriment on representations made
7 by that defendant.
8          So they're talking about the two defendants in this
9 case, Philip Morris and Lorillard.  This question is limited
10 to representations made by Philip Morris and Lorillard.
11          Question 7 broadens it a little bit to include
12 statements and representations made by other cigarette
13 companies.
14          Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I want to focus you on
15 the date.  There's a date in both of these questions, May 5,
16 1982, May 5, 1982.  That is a requirement of Florida law.  So
17 the gist of what you should be thinking about with respect to
18 both of these questions is as follows.  Ask yourself if Fred
19 Jacobson made any decision about cigarette smoking because of
20 a representation made by a cigarette company after May 5,
21 1982.
22          The evidence is undisputed in this case, ladies and
23 gentlemen.  Fred Jacobson never saw, read or heard a single
24 statement about smoking and health made by a cigarette
25 company, and certainly not after May 5, 1982; and we know that

1 because Ronnie Jacobson told us.  Her testimony on this point
2 was crystal clear, crystal clear.  These are the questions I
3 asked her:
4          Mr. Jacobson never told you that he ever saw, read or
5 heard a single statement about smoking and health made by
6 either Lorillard, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds or any
7 cigarette company, for that matter, isn't the true?
8          Her answer was:  Correct.
9          Well, I didn't stop there.  We asked her additional
10 questions.
11          You heard about some of these industry organizations
12 that Dr. Proctor talked about.  So we asked her about those
13 too:
14          He never told you that he had ever seen, read or
15 heard a single statement put out by either the Council for
16 Tobacco Research, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, or
17 the Tobacco Institute?
18          And her answer was:  Yes.
19          Mr. Kaiser talked about all kinds of statements,
20 talked about everything Dr. Proctor said.  Mrs. Jacobson told
21 you, as far as my husband told me, he never saw, he never
22 read, he never heard a single statement from a cigarette
23 company.
24          And you know now, after hearing the whole story, he
25 wasn't influenced by anything that cigarette companies were

1 saying or doing.  Mrs. Jacobson told you, my husband was not
2 the kind of person who was going to be influenced by
3 advertising.  He was a salesman.  He understood what it was
4 all about.
5          You know that long before May 5, 1982, Fred Jacobson
6 was told by many people that cigarette smoking caused disease
7 and was addictive.  He was told by the Surgeon General in
8 1964.  He was told by his friends, Alan Weidberg and
9 Dr. Michael Weiner.  He was told by his own children.  Every
10 cigarette pack from 1966 forward told him that.  And
11 Dr. Feinberg told him in 1982.
12          You now know that for many years Fred Jacobson didn't
13 listen to what anyone told him about cigarette smoking.  So,
14 if he wasn't listening to his friends, his family or his
15 doctors, what makes anyone think he would have paid attention
16 to anything a cigarette company had to say?
17          He was well informed and independent.  Fred Jacobson,
18 and only Fred Jacobson, made the decision to make cigarettes
19 and ultimately he was the only person that made the decision
20 to quit.
21          Your answer to questions 6 and 7 should be no, ladies
22 and gentlemen, should be no.
23          Now, I don't think you're going to get that far.  But
24 if you get this far, you'll consider the issue of compensatory
25 damages.  The issue is to determine the amount of money to

1 compensate Mrs. Jacobson for the loss of her husband.
2          And you heard Mr. Kaiser ask you to award millions of
3 dollars.  And frankly, I don't even know what to say about
4 that, ladies and gentlemen.  But use your common sense.
5          Recall Mrs. Jacobson's testimony under oath in this
6 courtroom.  Remember the things she refused to acknowledge to
7 you about her husband under oath.  Remember that her testimony
8 was contradicted by what her husband told his doctors many
9 years ago, by what he wrote down in his own records, and by
10 what she said in her own deposition under oath just a few
11 months ago.
12          I would respectfully suggest that if you get to the
13 issue of compensatory damages, you write in zero, zero, ladies
14 and gentlemen.  We all make lifestyle choices and we have to
15 live with the consequences of those lifestyle choices.
16          Now, the final issue is punitive damages and let me
17 just address that briefly.  What you are being asked to decide
18 today is whether or not punitive damages should be awarded.
19 You are not deciding the amount.  If you say yes that you
20 think punitive damages should be awarded, there will be an
21 additional phase of this case; there will be additional
22 evidence and witnesses presented to you; and you will have a
23 second round of deliberations to decide what the amount ought
24 to be.  Any punitive damages that you ultimately decide to
25 award would all go to Mrs. Jacobson, and only Mrs. Jacobson.

1          The purpose of punitive damages is to punish and
2 deter, not to compensate.  So, if you decide ultimately that
3 you think Mrs. Jacobson is entitled to receive money for her
4 husband's decision to smoke, you will compensate her fully
5 through an award of compensatory damages.  Punitive damages
6 are an additional amount above and beyond any compensatory
7 damages you might award.
8          Now, the Court will instruct you that there's a
9 higher burden of proof.  It's called clear and convincing
10 evidence.  It will be defined for you in the instructions.
11 The gist of it is you have to be really, really, really
12 convinced based on the evidence you've heard that punitive
13 damages are appropriate.
14          Now, let me make one last point.  Punitive damages
15 are warranted based only on conduct that you heard that
16 specifically affected Fred Jacobson.  This is Mr. Jacobson's
17 case and only Mr. Jacobson's case.  It's not a class action
18 anymore.  It's not about other people.  So this is about
19 whether the conduct you heard during the trial harmed
20 Mr. Jacobson specifically.
21          Now, based on the evidence you've heard in this case,
22 ladies and gentlemen, there is simply no basis to award
23 punitive damages.  Fred Jacobson was strong, independent,
24 intelligent, well informed.  There is absolutely no dispute
25 about that.

1          You know that Philip Morris and Lorillard had nothing
2 to do with the decisions he made about cigarette smoking.
3 Fred Jacobson made his own lifestyle choices.  So there should
4 be no question that if you get to the question of punitive
5 damages, your answer should be no.
6          THE COURT:  I can only give you five more minutes,
7 Mr. Geraghty.
8          MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm going to be done in 45 seconds.
9          THE COURT:  Okay.
10          MR. GERAGHTY:  I am going to sit down in a moment,
11 and after Mr. Pedrosa addresses you, Mr. Kaiser and Mr. Finger
12 will have one more opportunity to speak to you and that's
13 because the plaintiff bears the burden of proof in this case.
14          As you listen to either what Mr. Kaiser or Mr. Finger
15 says on rebuttal, I want to you remember the four key points.
16 These four key points have been proved very clearly to you
17 during the course of this trial, and they tell you everything
18 you need to know to decide the issues in this case, everything
19 you need to know.
20          We enjoy a tremendous amount of freedom in this
21 country, ladies and gentlemen.  We have the right to make
22 decisions and lifestyle choices for ourselves that are not in
23 our best interests, and with that freedom comes the obligation
24 to accept personal responsibility for the consequences of
25 those decisions.

1          And at the end of the day, that's what this case is
2 all about:  Are we going to hold Philip Morris and Lorillard
3 legally responsible for the informed decisions of a strong,
4 intelligent and independent man who lived his life exactly the
5 way he wanted to live it.
6          Based on the evidence you've heard, I think the
7 answer is clear.  The evidence supports a verdict in favor of
8 Philip Morris and Lorillard, and I would ask you, ladies and
9 gentlemen, to return a verdict in favor of Philip Morris and
10 Lorillard.
11          Now, I am just about done and I want you to
12 understand that it has been an honor and a privilege to be
13 able to present this case to you.  You have been extremely
14 attentive and patient during everything I've done during the
15 trial, and I want you to know one final time that I appreciate
16 it very much and I thank you very much for your jury service.
17 Thank you.


         MR. PEDROSA:  Good afternoon, everyone.  On behalf of
my partner, David Batista, and my client, Lorillard, I want to
join Mr. Kaiser and Mr. Geraghty in thanking you for your
service, and, in particular, in thanking you for being so
attentive.
         You know, I owe you, I think, probably a little bit
more thanks than anyone else because I'm always the last one to
get up, and I usually have the least to say.  So thank you for
paying attention from beginning to end, even to me.
         You know, Mr. Geraghty was very thorough in going
through the evidence with you from start to finish and in going
through the verdict form with you.  I certainly agree with
everything that he said, so I'm not going to go back and cover
all of that.
         But in thinking about where I would kind of end with
you all, I figured I would end where I started.  At this point
it's not a real surprise what I'm going to say, but I do want to
take a moment to talk about the evidence that we saw about
Mr. Jacobson.
         That evidence was that Mr. Jacobson was a person who
was informed at a very early age that there were health risks
associated with smoking.  We heard evidence going all the way
back to the 1950s, the type of environment that his parents
created, the type of environment that existed in the schools
where they were required to teach about the health effects of
smoking.
         We learned over the course of this trial that
Mr. Jacobson was a smart man, that he was intelligent, and he
understood risks and understood the risks of smoking.  He was a
smart, savvy businessman who was independent and made his own
decisions.
         We learned over the course of this trial from every
witness that knew Mr. Jacobson that he was the type of person
that in all aspects of his life took charge, took control of his
own decisions, and was in control of his choices including the
decisions that he made about smoking.
         You know, for a lot of years in the 1960s and '70s
Mr. Jacobson was aware there were risks to smoking, but he
wasn't interested in quitting.  That's what he would tell the
people that would talk to him about it, like his friend Alan
Weidberg.  Alan, you should go lose some weight.  I will live my
life, you live your life, and that's the way it's going to be.
         That's okay.  Because when Mr. Jacobson decided that he
wanted to quit smoking in the early 1980s when his first wife
Bonnie was sick, he was successful and he quit.  And he stayed
quit for as long as he wanted to stay quit.  On that particular
occasion he stayed quit for about a year until the time that he
met the woman that would go on to become his second wife, Ronnie
Jacobson, who was also a smoker back then.
         When Mr. Jacobson after a year of being quit did go
back to smoking, it wasn't nicotine that led him back to
smoking.  He hadn't had a cigarette in about a year.  The
nicotine was all out of his system.  It wasn't advertisements
that led him to go back to smoking.  You heard the testimony
from Mrs. Jacobson and from Mr. Jacobson's daughter, Jennifer.
He didn't pay attention to advertisements.  He was a salesman.
He knew all about advertising, and he taught his daughter,
Jennifer, when she was a little girl not to trust
advertisements.
         When Mr. Jacobson made the decision to go back to
smoking in 1984, '83, '84, he was in control, and he did it
because it was something he enjoyed doing, even though he
understood that there were some risks associated with smoking.
         You know, Mr. Kaiser told you that if Mr. Jacobson had
stayed quit at that point, had quit in the early 1980s and
stayed quit, we probably wouldn't be here because as soon as
someone quits smoking, their body starts to repair itself, and
the risk of getting any disease from smoking starts to go down.
That's true.
         But I want to be very clear about one thing.  We are
not here to second guess Mr. Jacobson's decisions about how he
was going to live his life.  The questions that you are going to
answer on that verdict form aren't about whether or not you
agree with the decisions that he made.  Nobody is here to blame
him for his decisions.  They were his decisions to make.
         You know, like everyone in this room, like everyone who
lives in this country, Mr. Jacobson had the freedom to decide to
do things that he enjoyed doing, even though they might be
risky, even though they might have some long-term health
consequences.
         You know, everyone in this country has to make those
same decisions for themselves every single day.  Am I going to
smoke or not?  Am I going to drink alcohol or not?  How fast am
I going to drive?  Am I going to engage in hobbies that might be
dangerous or have some risks associated with them?
         But with the freedom to make those kinds of decisions
for ourselves comes responsibility.  Mr. Jacobson was no
different.  You didn't hear any evidence in this case that made
him any different than the 55 or 60 million Americans who have
quit smoking.
         Ladies and gentlemen, those decisions were his
decisions to make.  It was up to him and no one else.  And the
evidence in this case has been clear, addiction didn't control
Mr. Jacobson.  Addiction didn't control him when he quit smoking
for a year in the early 1980s.  Addiction didn't control him
when he quit smoking for several years in the late 1980s, and
addiction didn't control him when he quit smoking for good in
1996.
         Mr. Jacobson was informed about the health risks of
smoking.  He was intelligent and understood those risks, and he
made independent decisions because he was always the one in
control.
         Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
