MR. DAVIS: Mr. Kerrivan, Counsel.
May it please you, ladies and gentlemen of the
jury. I want to echo on behalf of Ms. Skagerberg and myself
our appreciation for your service and for your incredible
focus and attention over the past two weeks as you have
listened to the evidence. We appreciate that very, very much
and thank you.
Now, obviously, I'm going to leave some time for
Ms. Patterson to speak after I have a chance to talk with
you.
This is a case about Kenneth Kerrivan. It's not
about smokers in general. It's about the decisions that Mr.
Kerrivan made, his decision to start smoking, his decision to
continue smoking despite knowing the health risks, and his
11:00:57
11:01:00
11:01:56
11:01:58
11:02:01
11:02:05
11:02:08
11:02:11
11:02:11
11:02:12
11:02:14
11:02:14
11:02:17
11:02:18
11:02:22
11:02:28
11:02:31
11:02:35
11:02:36
11:02:40
11:02:44
11:02:45
11:02:48
11:02:53
11:02:58
74 decision not to stop until he was motivated to do so.
And to understand those decisions better, we have
prepared a timeline, and I would like to walk through that
with you to point out both some events in Mr. Kerrivan's life
but also to point out information that was publicly and
widely known.
All right. Folks, we know that Mr. Kerrivan was
born in 1942. We know that he moved in with his uncle in
'54. We know -- it's not on here -- that he remembers when
he was seven some fighting between his mom and his dad about
smoking. He remembers in retrospect it may have been about
money.
We know that he tried his first cigarette at about
1956 when it was given to him by his friend Leon del Marco at
the bus stop, and he said he coughed and he hacked, and he
testified to is that "I should have realized back then this
is not for you."
We know that in the late '50s and early '60s Mr.
Kerrivan's uncle, who was a smoker, developed breathing
problems, and that sometime around '58 or '59 Mr. Kerrivan
started smoking every day. And he told us, I believe -- your
recollection is what's important, but he testified that "A
pack would last me three or four days" in that time frame.
Then he moved on into the '60s, and that's when he
increased his smoking, I think, initially to a half a pack
11:03:01
11:03:06
11:03:11
11:03:15
11:03:20
11:03:25
11:03:45
11:03:47
11:03:53
11:03:58
11:04:02
11:04:06
11:04:06
11:04:10
11:04:16
11:04:22
11:04:25
11:04:27
11:04:33
11:04:36
11:04:42
11:04:45
11:04:49
11:04:53
11:04:58
75 and then on up.
Now, if you look at -- we also -- of course, he's
not clear on the date, but we know Mr. Kerrivan's uncle
ultimately died of lung cancer some time in the early '60s.
Now, Dr. Grunberg told you if you go way back in
time, that scientists and investigators knew 100 years ago
that nicotine was a drug and could be addictive. And we know
that in the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s there were articles
in Reader's Digest, one of the most popular, if not the most
popular magazine at that time on health and addiction.
We heard evidence of the 1953 study by Drs. Wynder
and Graham, the mouse skin-painting study. That was in '53.
And that the next year, the Gallop organization did a poll,
and 90 percent of Americans at that time had heard that
smoking may cause cancer.
Then beginning right in that same time period,
there were TV programs on smoking and health, like the See It
Now and Edward R. Murrow examples that -- and shows that we
showed you.
Now, as we move into the '60s, let's start in the
public arena. We know that there was the 1964 Surgeon
General's report. That was the first report, of course, on
smoking and health. Dr. Proctor, I believe, called that
report one of the beginnings of the end of smoking or end of
cigarettes.
11:05:01
11:05:02
11:05:10
11:05:13
11:05:18
11:05:21
11:05:24
11:05:28
11:05:34
11:05:38
11:05:42
11:05:47
11:05:53
11:05:57
11:06:00
11:06:03
11:06:05
11:06:11
11:06:17
11:06:30
11:06:34
11:06:39
11:06:42
11:06:47
11:06:53
76 Through the mid '60s there were PSA's, Public
Service Announcements, on smoking and health. You may
remember that we showed you in 1966 that PSA, that famous
poster, "Congress has acted and the next step is yours."
In 1966, the first warning went on the packs. This
is the one that said, "Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to
your health."
And then, again, the PSA's began in the '60s, and I
think we showed you one example which was the Bill Talman, he
was the Perry Mason prosecutor, who said, "This is a case
that I don't want to lose."
Then later there was the PSA, I think it was a
number of years later, but these PSA's continued, and you saw
the example of Larry Hagman, who was that famous actor from I
Dream of Genie and from Dallas, who was doing his explanation
about that.
We do know as well that between 1966 and 1970,
during the time of that first warning, that 13 million
Americans had quit smoking.
Now, if we go up and see what's going on with Mr.
Kerrivan during this time period, we know that in 1964 he
marries Cheryl and that his first child, Karen, was born in
1965, a year later.
He testified that he avoided smoking near her when
she was a baby, because she was afraid the smoke, in his
11:06:53
11:06:58
11:07:02
11:07:07
11:07:12
11:07:17
11:07:20
11:07:22
11:07:26
11:07:30
11:07:34
11:07:35
11:07:39
11:07:42
11:07:47
11:07:52
11:07:52
11:07:59
11:08:03
11:08:04
11:08:08
11:08:15
11:08:19
11:08:21
11:08:25
77 words, might do something to her.
Beginning in about that time and throughout the
'70s, Mr. Kerrivan worked for the John Fray Company. You
recall the testimony that Mr. Fray did not like smoking and
that every day he came onto the job site where Mr. Kerrivan
was working and said, "Them cigarettes are no good for you."
So this was kind of a continuous daily message that he was
getting as we go through this time period.
Now, he testified about the 1966 warning. He
remembered that he saw that warning when it came out in 1966.
He testified that that was the first time that he really
understood that the Surgeon General was saying that smoking
is bad for your health.
He did say he had reading problems, of course, but
he was able to understand the intent and meaning of that
warning. He told us that.
He also in that same time period, about '66
forward, testified that he remembered the Surgeon General
saying on television that smoking is a bad habit, and you
should quit.
In 1967, and we talked a fair amount about this,
this was when he had that incident where he picked up his
mother to go to Aunt Anna's house. She was moving slow. He
was trying to hurry her up. And she said, "I can't move
fast. I can't breathe." And he knew at that point that she
11:08:29
11:08:32
11:08:36
11:08:41
11:08:45
11:08:50
11:08:54
11:08:58
11:09:02
11:09:07
11:09:12
11:09:15
11:09:18
11:09:20
11:09:26
11:09:28
11:09:32
11:09:34
11:09:37
11:09:40
11:09:42
11:09:47
11:09:49
11:09:56
11:10:00
78 had lung and breathing problems, and he thought they were
related to her smoking. She was a smoker.
Now, it's unclear in the evidence whether it was
right then that he knew she had emphysema. He suggested that
she might have told him then, right in 1967, that she had
emphysema. There was other testimony that would suggest that
he didn't associate that word with her breathing problems
until sometime later.
Michael, the second child, was born in 1968.
Again, just to remind you of the time frames here,
he was 22 when the first Surgeon General's report came out.
When that first warning came out, he was 24 years old. And
then in 1967, he was 25.
We move into the 1970s. Just as the headline here
on this, just to put the whole decade, Mr. Kerrivan testified
that he did not want to quit smoking, and he did not try to
quit smoking throughout the entirety of the 1970s.
In 1970 -- we'll go back to the bottom here, the
public stuff below the black line. In 1970, there was a new
pack warning, "Warning: The Surgeon General has determined
that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health."
We know that in 1971 all cigarette advertisement on
television ended. And the next year, the same Surgeon
General's warning went on all cigarette advertisements and
other media, print ads, et cetera.
11:10:02
11:10:05
11:10:08
11:10:11
11:10:15
11:10:20
11:10:23
11:10:27
11:10:29
11:10:37
11:10:40
11:10:45
11:10:48
11:11:04
11:11:08
11:11:11
11:11:15
11:11:19
11:11:23
11:11:27
11:11:30
11:11:33
11:11:37
11:11:41
11:11:44
79 We know that by 1979, at the end of the decade,
that 30 million Americans had quit smoking and that
throughout this decade smoking and health PSA's, Public
Service Announcements, continued.
We'll go up and see where Mr. Kerrivan was.
Mr. Kerrivan, in 1970, testified about that
warning. He understands that a new pack warning is out and
that it's a warning that cigarettes are bad for you, and he
understood that, he told us, with every time he picked up a
pack.
He's still working for Mr. Fray in this time frame.
At some point here he takes the other job working on glass.
We're not quite sure when this happens, but it appears that
he worked for Mr. Fray at some point in this period and then
began working in the glass work that he did.
In any event, once he started working in glass
work, he testified that he had a chronic, all the time, what
he called a "cigarette cough." That was his term.
In 1972, his last -- his youngest, Donna, was born,
but that was also the year that he and his wife divorced.
From 1974 on -- remember, by this time Karen, who
is the oldest, is in elementary school. From that point on,
from the time she was in elementary school, Mr. Kerrivan
tells Karen not to smoke because he knows it's not good for
her.
11:11:48
11:11:51
11:11:55
11:12:00
11:12:01
11:12:05
11:12:10
11:12:13
11:12:16
11:12:19
11:12:19
11:12:25
11:12:31
11:12:33
11:12:36
11:12:38
11:12:42
11:12:46
11:12:50
11:12:55
11:12:57
11:13:03
11:13:07
11:13:10
11:13:13
80 We move into the 1980s. He testified -- he
testified that he was not highly motivated to quit smoking in
the 1980s, but you also recall that when he testified here in
court, apparently for the first time ever, he claimed what he
called, his term, "spotty" attempts to quit in the 1980s.
And he said he would make New Year's resolutions. He didn't
specify which year. He didn't tell us which New Year's it
was. And that he would quit for a week at a time. And where
I got the "week" was his testimony that he would make the
resolution. He would throw the cigarettes away, but a week
later he'd be smoking again. That's what he said.
In any event, in the public sector, this was -- oh,
this was the Larry Hagman, the Dallas, I Dream of Jeannie.
So you can see -- just to show you bracketing -- the
consistency of these messages in the public, on television,
et cetera.
In 1985, this was where the rotating warnings came
out. We showed you two of those. One that said, "Quitting
smoking now greatly reduces your health risks."
The other specifically mentions emphysema caused by
cigarette smoking.
His chronic cigarette cough continues throughout
this period while he continues to do work with glass.
In the early '80s, he warns Karen -- this is when
she was a teenager. He smelled smoke on her. He said, "I
11:13:14
11:13:33
11:13:37
11:13:42
11:13:46
11:13:52
11:13:55
11:14:00
11:14:04
11:14:07
11:14:11
11:14:15
11:14:20
11:14:23
11:14:25
11:14:30
11:14:31
11:14:35
11:14:38
11:14:43
11:14:51
11:14:51
11:14:56
11:14:59
11:15:05
81 will make you eat a pack of cigarettes if I catch you
smoking."
We know -- there was some question about why Dr.
Brodnan came. Dr. Brodnan came to make absolutely clear the
importance of this 1982 date in this case. I think it's also
supported by the chart that Dr. Gravelyn gave you, which is
that if Mr. Kerrivan had quit smoking on or before 1982, the
medical probability is that he would never have contracted
COPD. You heard that from him.
And then from -- interestingly, Mr. Kerrivan, when
we asked him about these warnings, he said he never
understood those pack warnings, that he never saw the word
"emphysema," that it never registered with him that quitting
smoking -- that one of the messages was, "You need to smoke
now and it will help your health." And he testified that
from 1985, when those came out, all the way to 2006, when he
quit, those warnings did not -- he just didn't see them,
didn't pay attention to them or something.
All right. Then this moves us through to about
1991, 1992, when he moved to Florida.
All right. We're now in the 1990s. And this --
of course, again, just to repeat, he moved down here to
Florida, '91, '92. You remember the circumstances of that.
Karen had moved down a year or two before. She had -- he had
a grandchild, first one. He came down to visit. He liked
11:15:08
11:15:11
11:15:11
11:15:14
11:15:17
11:15:22
11:15:25
11:15:31
11:15:36
11:15:38
11:15:42
11:15:45
11:15:49
11:15:53
11:15:56
11:16:00
11:16:04
11:16:08
11:16:10
11:16:15
11:16:19
11:16:40
11:16:44
11:16:49
11:16:55
82 Florida. It was warm, a good place, a lot of people from
New York do that. He came back. He came down and moved in,
lived with Karen and her husband -- fiance at the time,
perhaps; I think it was fiance at the time -- for a while.
He did some painting work with him. You remember, found out
he was lazy and ultimately moved on in '74 to get the job
with Wimpy's Wrecker Service. But that's what got him down
here to Florida. He lived with her for a while and Johnny
Sole. Then moved out and found his own place.
But in 1993, Dr. Stevens diagnoses Mr. Kerrivan
with COPD. He was very clear about that date. He remembered
it very clearly. Says, "You've got to quit smoking."
Again, for the first time, we believe, ever, he
testified in this court that he quit immediately upon that.
He testified that he quit cold turkey for two weeks.
He also testified that he continued throughout the
period of '93 to '96 to see Dr. Stevens about once a month,
that every time he saw her, she told him to quit; that in
that period, he quit a few times for as much as two weeks
each.
The Wimpy's, the tow truck work that he testified
about, began in 1994. His good friend, John Howard -- dear
friend I think he was characterized by counsel -- tells Mr.
Kerrivan that, "Hey, you know what? I have COPD." And this
is Mr. Kerrivan's recollection of what he was told in the
11:16:59
11:17:03
11:17:07
11:17:15
11:17:18
11:17:20
11:17:25
11:17:29
11:17:33
11:17:35
11:17:39
11:17:42
11:17:45
11:17:50
11:17:54
11:17:59
11:18:05
11:18:10
11:18:15
11:18:21
11:18:23
11:18:27
11:18:33
11:18:39
11:18:43
83 mid-'90s. "If you don't quit, it's going to kill you."
At the same time, his co-worker, who may have been
the boss, actually, at that outfit, developed lung cancer.
He's the one that died. He was a smoker, just as Mr. Howard
was. He developed lung cancer, and he's the one that died at
an early age. And there was some suggestion in the evidence
that when Mr. Frost died -- and this is jumping forward to
about '06, '07 -- he was the boss at that time, and that's
when the work ended because the company went away.
In any event, I guess the point we would make about
this is this was at a time after -- many years after he had
been diagnosed with COPD and had been continually told that
your COPD is caused by smoking, and you need to quit.
The first -- Dr. Grunberg, having looked at all the
medical records and interviewed Mr. Kerrivan, could find only
two specific documented quit attempts. The first of these is
in 1996 or '97.
Now, we know it was after 1996 because he was using
the patch, and we know that the patch was not available
without a prescription until '96. And Mr. Kerrivan told us
that he did not need a prescription to get the patch. So he
uses the patch, and he quit for a month.
He testified that he does not remember being
nervous or jumpy while wearing the patch. And after a month
of no smoking, he did not smoke while he was using the patch,
11:18:45
11:18:49
11:18:52
11:18:56
11:19:00
11:19:04
11:19:07
11:19:11
11:19:16
11:19:19
11:19:22
11:19:26
11:19:31

11:19:42
11:19:47
11:19:52
11:19:56
11:19:59
11:20:02
11:20:07
11:20:11
11:20:15
11:20:18
11:20:23
84 he said that -- he made a decision to go back and start
smoking cigarettes again and quit using the patch. And what
he testified is, "If I'm not going to buy the patches, I
might as well get the real thing."
The period between 1996 and November 2005, which
leads up to the next, second, and last, documented attempt to
quit smoking, Mr. Kerrivan was regularly seeing his lung
doctors. He's told over and over and over again that he must
stop smoking for his health. But within this whole almost
ten-year period, there is no additional documented evidence
in any medical record of any quit attempt.
In November -- and we're backdating a couple of
months from the record that we have in January of '06. Maybe
I'll just start there.
We know that in January of '06, this was when he
had -- he was hospitalized for pneumonia. And he described
that event where his friends -- where the EMTs came over. He
had asked for oxygen, so the first time he had ever seen
oxygen or used it.
They brought one out of the truck. His EMT friend
came over and said, my God, Kenny, you're about to die.
We've got to get you in. He fought it. They gave him
oxygen, and he went to the hospital. And it was in that
event, in January of '06, that Dr. Campbell told him, if you
don't quit smoking, you're going to be dead in six months.
11:20:26
11:20:31
11:20:35
11:20:40
11:20:42
11:20:48
11:20:53
11:20:58
11:21:04
11:21:08
11:21:13
11:21:17
11:21:35
11:21:39
11:21:40
11:21:44
11:21:47
11:21:51
11:21:54
11:21:55
11:21:59
11:22:02
11:22:05
11:22:08
11:22:13
85 But in that record, you recall, there is a
reference that he had actually gotten pneumonia two months
before. So we're backdating that to about November. And at
the time he went into the hospital, he had not had a
cigarette for two months.
And so he got the pneumonia and quit -- actually
quit smoking cigarettes in November of '05, but the pneumonia
had progressed to the point that he was very sick and in the
hospital in January '06.
And it was at this point in his life that he
testified that he made the decision to quit smoking. He did
it cold turkey, no aid, no gum, nothing.
And his words were, "I made up my mind I am not
going to have a cigarette. I was determined I wasn't going
to have it."
And that was -- it was after that that you recall
that he went back home. He got the Stanley Steamer folks in
to do the rugs. He got the painters in to do the KILZ, paint
the walls. I think he got Stanley Steamer or somebody back
to do the AC vents. He was trying to avoid any smell of
smoke.
He had the new truck that had never been smoked in,
and he went out -- and a couple of nights he said he even
slept there to avoid -- before it all got cleaned up so that
he wouldn't smell the smoke.
11:22:17
11:22:22
11:22:25
11:22:29
11:22:32
11:22:34
11:22:39
11:22:42
11:22:46
11:22:48
11:22:52
11:22:57
11:22:59
11:23:03
11:23:06
11:23:07
11:23:09
11:23:15
11:23:20
11:23:23
11:23:27
11:23:28
11:23:30
11:23:34
11:23:37
86 And he is now an absolute -- and since that time,
is an absolute former smoker. Really, since November of '05
and certainly since he made that decision in January of '06,
Mr. Kerrivan has never had another cigarette. And he
testified to us that he never felt like he needed another
cigarette.
And so we are now eight -- almost nine years from
that event. We also know from just the numbers that as we
get into our time frame today that 60 million smokers in our
country have quit smoking.
All right. One of the things I was going to play,
and I think because of my desire to get us out of here before
lunch, but I would like to remind you of it, is the power of
that 1964 Harry Reasoner piece. I'm not going to play it
again, but you saw it. That was the one that came out
immediately after the 1964 report when CBS News did that
special report and Harry Reasoner talked so poignantly, one
of the most respected journalists at that time, about choice
and the time now is what we know about smoking.
But you do recall that. And I just mention it
because it was emblematic of the incredible publicity that
that 1964 report got when it came out.
All right. I'd like now to turn to the Verdict
Form. I'll put this down. I'll walk through a couple of
questions with you on that.
11:23:39
11:23:40
11:23:46
11:23:49
11:23:53
11:23:56
11:23:57
11:24:01
11:24:05
11:24:11
11:24:13
11:24:41
11:24:44
11:24:49
11:24:54
11:24:56
11:25:01
11:25:07
11:25:11
11:25:17
11:25:21
11:25:24
11:25:28
11:25:33
11:25:40
87 The first question, as was pointed out, was
Mr. Kerrivan addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?
Now, in your instructions that Judge Erickson gave
you, there is no legal definition of addiction. You are to
decide this case. It's a question of fact for you, as judges
of the facts, to decide based on all the evidence.
Now, there's no dispute that Mr. Kerrivan over his
lifetime smoked a lot of cigarettes, but remember that
Dr. Grunberg told us that not everyone who smokes cigarettes,
even a lot of cigarettes, is addicted. So it's not enough in
answering question one to simply know that he smoked a lot of
cigarettes.
They did bring you Dr. Grunberg, who testified that
Mr. Kerrivan was addicted to cigarettes. And you remember
that he did use a definition of that from the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, the NIDA, N-I-D-A, in which he
characterized addiction, and it is characterized there, as a
chronic relapsing brain disease.
So how did Dr. Grunberg go about determining
whether Mr. Kerrivan had a chronic relapsing brain disease?
Well, he first said that you cannot tell the
difference between an addiction to a drug and a habit
involving a drug unless somebody stops being exposed to that
drug and to see whether or not you get withdrawal symptoms.
So a key under the NIDA definition and Dr. Grunberg
11:25:41
11:25:44
11:25:48
11:25:51
11:25:56
11:26:00
11:26:04
11:26:07
11:26:12
11:26:15
11:26:20
11:26:24
11:26:25
11:26:30
11:26:33
11:26:36
11:26:42
11:26:46
11:26:49
11:26:53
11:26:58
11:27:01
11:27:06
11:27:10
11:27:15
88 is you have to have somebody stop their exposure to the drug,
and then you look carefully to see whether they have
withdrawal symptoms.
He also told us that it is typical of an addicted
smoker to have six or seven quit attempts before they are
able finally to stop.
Now, we know there was no evidence whatsoever that
Mr. Kerrivan quit at any time in the '60s -- tried to quit at
any time in the 1960s and '70s. So there can be no evidence
of withdrawal symptoms in that time.
And Mr. Kerrivan raised the possibility through the
testimony here about the New Year's resolutions, that he may
have quit for a week -- a few times in the '80s before he
moved to Florida, but he did tell us for sure that throughout
the decade of the '80s, he was not motivated to quit smoking
at any time in that period.
And the thing, I think, that's significant here is
that Dr. Grunberg had really -- really engaged this case. He
testified about that. He looked at all the medical records.
He read all the depositions of all the witnesses and family
members that he testified about that had testified under oath
before we came here to court.
And he interviewed Mr. Kerrivan on the phone and
spent time with him, asking him about his smoking, about his
efforts to quit, et cetera.
11:27:20
11:27:23
11:27:25
11:27:26
11:27:31
11:27:35
11:27:37
11:27:42
11:27:47
11:27:51
11:27:53
11:27:57
11:28:02
11:28:08
11:28:11
11:28:17
11:28:18
11:28:22
11:28:27
11:28:30
11:28:35
11:28:39
11:28:42
11:28:46
11:28:50
89 Dr. Grunberg never said anything about New Year's
resolutions and quitting for a week during the '80s. He
didn't mention that at all.
He also testified that the only two specific quit
attempts that he could find from the evidence were the patch
that we talked about in '96 or shortly thereafter -- and we
say '97 because you know there's that medical record that
mentions the patch. We know it was after '96. The patch,
quit for a month, no smoking, "I might as well get the real
thing," going back to cigarettes, and then jump forward to
2006 when he was told by Dr. Campbell, if you don't quit,
you're only going to live for six months, and that's when he
quit for good. That's Dr. Grunberg's analysis of his quit
attempts.
MR. BYRD: Objection, Your Honor. That misstates
the testimony.
THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, one
of the things that happens when there are objections to
misstating the evidence is that you need to bear in mind that
you are ultimately the judge of what the evidence is and what
it says.
Now, the lawyers are not free to misstate the
evidence, but they don't have a perfect recollection as to
what was said and when it was said either.
And so what I tell juries all the time is that,
11:28:52
11:28:58
11:29:03
11:29:05
11:29:11
11:29:16
11:29:21
11:29:24
11:29:28
11:29:32
11:29:36
11:29:41
11:29:43
11:29:47
11:29:47
11:29:49
11:29:51
11:29:53
11:29:57
11:30:00
11:30:04
11:30:04
11:30:10
11:30:13
11:30:15
90 ultimately, if you think that what's been stated is not
correct, that's your decision to make, because you are the
judges of the questions of the fact, okay?
And I'm not going to interject and say whether I
believe that it's a misstatement or not, because I don't have
perfect recall either. And so I'm just going to leave that
all to you, okay?
MR. DAVIS: Very good, Your Honor.
And let me be clear what I'm saying. If you -- I
would respectfully suggest to you that Dr. Grunberg never
testified about any attempt or any quits that Mr. Kerrivan
made on New Year's resolutions during the '80s where he threw
his cigarettes away and put them down for a week. But I
agree; it is absolutely your recollection of the evidence
that is important.
I also respectfully suggest to you that the only
two specific documented quit attempts that he could find in
the record were the patch in '96, '97 and the final quit
attempt in '06.
Now, as to the two specific quit attempts, the
patch and the final quit in '06, Dr. Grunberg didn't
associate any withdrawal symptoms to the quits. He did not
testify as to any specific withdrawal symptoms to the patch
or to the quit -- the final quit in '06.
What he did was he said that the salient example of
11:30:17
11:30:21
11:30:24
11:30:26
11:30:29
11:30:31
11:30:34
11:30:37
11:30:38
11:30:42
11:30:47
11:30:53
11:30:58
11:31:03
11:31:06
11:31:07
11:31:11
11:31:15
11:31:20
11:31:22
11:31:27
11:31:33
11:31:39
11:31:43
11:31:47
91 withdrawal was the incident when Mr. Kerrivan attended
Karen's wedding, and that's why that issue came up in the
case, is that Dr. Grunberg pointed that out to you as one of
the most salient, most vivid examples of what he thought was
a withdrawal symptom from smoking.
Now, what he said -- he had read Donna Fletcher's
deposition, the youngest daughter. And you recall he said --
his interpretation of that, that what she said was that
Mr. Kerrivan was prevented from smoking at that wedding, and
he got so mad and irritable that he could not smoke that he
actually left his daughter's wedding. And he found that to
be striking.
But what he -- what he ignored was Karen's
testimony from her deposition where she testified that she
asked her father not to smoke at her wedding reception, but
he did anyway, and she let it go because the last time they
had a fight about smoking, when he was at her house and
blowing it out the door, the sliding door, they fought over
it and that they didn't talk to each other for two years.
So her story was she let it go.
Then Mr. Kerrivan said that he did smoke at his
daughter's wedding. He went back. He convinced her later to
give him a cigarette. He was holding it down and that she
saw him. She came up. They got in a fight about it and that
he -- that he left at that point, and he didn't speak to her
11:31:51
11:31:58
11:32:01
11:32:05
11:32:10
11:32:14
11:32:19
11:32:23
11:32:26
11:32:30
11:32:34
11:32:39
11:32:40
11:32:44
11:32:49
11:32:53
11:32:58
11:33:03
11:33:07
11:33:11
11:33:14
11:33:18
11:33:22
11:33:26
11:33:29
92 for -- he said he didn't speak to her for quite a while but
that ultimately, I think he said, she got over it.
Now, my point in all that is simply that
Dr. Grunberg, I suggest to you, cherry-picked one version of
a family story and took that story and presented it as an
example of withdrawal, the most -- but it didn't have
anything to do with withdrawal from Mr. Kerrivan's own
testimony. He was smoking. He was -- this was not a
situation where he was prevented from smoking and had a fit
and got crazy, and it's just a family dynamic.
I mean, we know about the issues that he and his
daughter had from Karen's testimony. We know how he felt
about her husband, who she was marrying then. It's just a
family dynamic. That's all it is. And I suggest to you that
that's not a reasonable or valid or credible story that deals
with any real withdrawal.
Now, the other notable thing about Mr. Kerrivan's
two documented quits is that he clearly did not relapse in
either one. He hasn't had a cigarette since he quit in
November of '06. He testified, as you know, that he hasn't
felt the need for one.
When he did use the patch in '97, he didn't relapse
because he -- it wasn't a situation where he said he had to
have cigarettes and couldn't use the patch. What he told us
was that, if I'm going to have to spend $45 a week for
11:33:33
11:33:37
11:33:39
11:33:43
11:33:46
11:33:52
11:33:56
11:33:59
11:34:03
11:34:06
11:34:11
11:34:14
11:34:18
11:34:22
11:34:25
11:34:30
11:34:31
11:34:36
11:34:40
11:34:44
11:34:47
11:34:48
11:34:53
11:34:57
11:35:01
93 patches, I might as well get the real thing.
So that was simply a choice that he made to give up
the patch, and I don't think he liked the brown spot on his
arm anyway, and go back to cigarettes.
So what's the answer to the first question? Well,
the burden of proof is on Mr. Kerrivan to prove that the
answer "yes" is more probable than not. If you think the
answer to that question is "no," then the case is over and we
go.
I would also note a couple of things about those
quit attempts that he testified to in the '80s and in some of
those others, is that Dr. Proctor told us about recall bias.
MR. BYRD: I object, Your Honor, to the testimony
"and we go."
MR. DAVIS: I don't know what testimony I was
referring to, Your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. Here's the thing: I'm not
sure exactly what the reference "and we go" was to. But the
deal is, whatever you do on the jury Verdict Form is what you
do that's on the jury Verdict Form. So you just follow the
instructions. If you answer "no" to the question, there will
be an instruction as to what you do there, all right?
And that's what you should do.
MR. DAVIS: Thank you, sir.
So I was offering a couple of thoughts about the
11:35:05
11:35:08
11:35:10
11:35:14
11:35:16
11:35:23
11:35:26
11:35:30
11:35:33
11:35:34
11:35:37
11:35:41
11:35:46
11:35:49
11:35:51
11:35:53
11:35:54
11:35:58
11:36:01
11:36:06
11:36:09
11:36:12
11:36:14
11:36:19
11:36:19
94 testimony that Mr. Kerrivan gave for the first time here
about those quits in the '80s and some of the other stuff
that happened in the '90s where he was quitting for a week or
so.
Dr. Proctor talked about recall bias. He did it in
the context of those -- what he called retrospective studies.
And you remember those are the ones where you take sick
people, those studies that were done, and you look back in
time and you ask them about their experiences. And he said
that those are questionable studies because when people are
sick and look back, there is a recall bias in the data, that
sometimes you're looking for somebody to blame, I think he
said.
I also would suggest to you that there is no
evidence in this case -- no corroborating evidence of
anything relating to Mr. Kerrivan's quits and indeed -- these
quit attempts that he's talking about other than his
testimony, no corroborating evidence from any other witness
that would have known or seen that.
And I also -- well, just that. Okay.
So let's move on to question two. Question two, as
I think Miss London suggested and explained to you, is this:
If Mr. Kerrivan was addicted to cigarettes, was his addiction
to cigarettes a legal cause of his COPD; yes or no?
Now, Miss London dealt with this. I'm going to
11:36:25
11:36:28
11:36:31
11:36:35
11:36:35
11:36:38
11:36:42
11:36:45
11:36:48
11:36:52
11:36:57
11:37:04
11:37:06
11:37:07
11:37:11
11:37:15
11:37:21
11:37:23
11:37:26
11:37:28
11:37:31
11:37:36
11:37:42
11:37:46
11:37:52
95 deal with this a little bit, too, because this is -- this is
an important instruction to both parties, as you know.
The instruction that Judge Erickson gave you is,
that to be a legal cause -- for addiction to be a legal cause
of his COPD, not a medical cause, a legal cause, he must
prove that his addiction directly and in natural and
continuous sequence produced or contributed substantially to
producing his COPD so that it can reasonably be said that but
for the addiction, his COPD would not have occurred.
It's not just a substantial contribution. It's a
substantial contribution such that you can say reasonably
that but for the addiction, he would not have gotten COPD.
Take away the addiction, no COPD for any other
reason.
Now, it certainly does -- there can be more than
one legal cause, no question. No question there can be more
than one legal cause.
But that language -- and we ask so much of you. We
ask you to be judges of the fact, and then we come in and we
throw these legal things that law students struggle with to
understand. We all do. But that language "but for, but
for," that is the key language to what legal cause really
means. And it is very different than medical cause of
something.
All right.
11:37:56
11:37:59
11:38:02
11:38:07
11:38:13
11:38:19
11:38:26
11:38:30
11:38:37
11:38:45
11:38:50
11:38:56
11:39:03
11:39:08
11:39:08
11:39:12
11:39:16
11:39:17
11:39:20
11:39:23
11:39:27
11:39:33
11:39:38
11:39:43
11:39:43
96 MR. BYRD: Objection, Your Honor.
THE COURT: "But for" cause is such that there may
be more than one "but for" cause. I just want to make that
plain. And I believe that was the nature of the objection.
And to that extent, I will sustain the objection. But I've
explained it, and you may go on.
MR. DAVIS: Sure.
It has to be a "but for" cause, and there can be
more than one "but for" cause, I believe is what I was trying
to express, Your Honor.
THE COURT: I believe you were.
MR. DAVIS: I apologize if I misstated it.
Every legal cause has to be a "but for" cause.
There can be more than one legal cause. That's the law, as I
understand it.
All right. So even if you decide that Mr. Kerrivan
was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine -- and
remember what Dr. Grunberg told you. He testified that even
addicted smokers can and do quit smoking. His words. It's
challenging to quit if you're addicted, but it's possible.
Each and every day, he told us, thousands of
smokers quit. 60 million people today have quit smoking.
And recall that Dr. Grunberg said that 80 percent
of those -- the overwhelming majority of those people who
have quit were addicted.
11:39:45
11:39:47
11:39:52
11:39:55
11:39:59
11:40:01
11:40:02
11:40:04
11:40:06
11:40:08
11:40:09
11:40:10
11:40:12
11:40:15
11:40:18
11:40:28
11:40:30
11:40:33
11:40:38
11:40:43
11:40:47
11:40:51
11:40:55
11:41:00
11:41:04
97 Now, you may be wondering, was Mr. Kerrivan in some
way different than that 80 percent? Is there a reason that
he was unable to quit when so many others were?
Well, Dr. Grunberg answered that question when he
testified, because he was asked and he said, "There is a
class of people, there are people who simply cannot quit."
But he also testified that Mr. Kerrivan was not one of them,
and we know that because he did. That's what Dr. Grunberg
said.
He quit cold turkey.
So the issue here is whether addiction -- his
addiction was a but for cause of him not quitting earlier in
time such that his COPD -- to prevent him getting his COPD.
As I've mentioned, Dr. Brodnan -- Dr. Gravelyn in
his chart, although it wasn't as clear, which is why I wanted
Dr. Brodnan to say it straight up, if he had quit by 1982,
before he was 40 years old, the science, the epidemiology is
that the medical probability, the medical evidence is that he
would not have developed COPD. 1982.
And we know -- I suggest to you that the evidence
is that he never tried to quit smoking before 1982. And we
know he wasn't motivated to try to quit smoking. And if
there's no evidence that Mr. Kerrivan tried to quit before he
was 40, then under Dr. Grunberg's definition, they can't
prove that addiction was a legal cause of him developing
11:41:07
11:41:11
11:41:15
11:41:19
11:41:23
11:41:27
11:41:35
11:41:40
11:41:44
11:41:45
11:41:49

11:42:43
11:42:47
11:42:51
11:42:56
98 COPD. They are missing a link in the chain, and that missing
link, the failure of proof, I suggest to you, means that the
answer to question two is no.
How can Mr. Kerrivan prove that his addiction was a
legal cause of COPD if he never quit or tried to quit? He
never even tried to quit during that entire period where if
he had, he wouldn't have gotten COPD at all.
Let's talk about that even one link at a time. He
could have quit in 1966 or tried to quit and seen whether he
was addicted, with withdrawal symptoms and relapse. He could
have done that in 1966 when the first warning went on the
packs, and he started hearing the Surgeon General on
television saying smoking is bad for you and you need to
quit.
He could have quit in 1967 when he had that very
personal warning from his mother, that experience with his
mother, with her lung problem, that he thought was related to
smoking and that he either then or later learned was
emphysema; in the 1970s, in the 1980s when he was repeatedly
and strongly warning his own daughter that smoking is bad for
her and addictive; between 1964 and 1979, any time in that
period when the undisputed evidence is that 30 million
people, 30 million Americans quit. But he didn't even try
during that period.
Now, we also heard from Dr. Brodnan, and I think it
11:43:00
11:43:04
11:43:08
11:43:10
11:43:15
11:43:21

11:43:49
11:43:50
11:43:54
11:43:57
11:44:00
11:44:04
11:44:09
11:44:12
11:44:19
11:44:23
11:44:27
11:44:28
99 was on Dr. Gravelyn's chart, but again I wanted you to hear
it straight up from Dr. Brodnan, if he had quit in 1993, if
he had quit in 1996 -- '93, when he was first diagnosed by
Dr. Stevens, 1996 when he went back -- and we had that first
medical record, because that is our first medical record when
they did the chest x-ray -- then he would not have developed
clinically significant COPD. And Dr. Gravelyn explained very
clearly what the positive effects would be.
Why didn't Mr. Kerrivan try to quit, really? Well,
it certainly wasn't because of the lack of information about
the risk of smoking. We've talked about what he knew from
his family, from his friends. We've talked about the public
information.
Now, the plaintiffs -- Dr. Grunberg and Dr.
Proctor, to some degree, suggested that if Mr. Kerrivan had
only known about the science of addiction, he would have
quit, but the fact that smoking is difficult to quit has been
known for a long time, and it was known by Mr. Kerrivan.
60 million smokers have quit, but Dr. Grunberg
testified that he has no evidence that any of those smokers
understood the science of addiction, such things as about how
nicotine passes the blood brain barrier, how the pH of smoke
affects the free molecules in the smoke that comes out, how
brain receptors work, how neurotransmitters work and all the
other aspects of nicotine and brain science.
11:44:35
11:44:43
11:44:44
11:44:49
11:44:52
11:44:56
11:45:00
11:45:08
11:45:10
11:45:13
11:45:16
11:45:19
11:45:23
11:45:24
11:45:28
11:45:33
11:45:39
11:45:44
11:45:47
11:45:53
11:45:57
11:46:01
11:46:06
11:46:12
11:46:15
100 Millions of people quit before that 1988 report in
which the Surgeon General said for the first time that
smoking is addictive and not a habit. But millions of people
quit.
And there's no evidence that every one of those
millions of people understood all the technical scientific
information that Dr. Grunberg has spent a life studying and
presented to you.
So why didn't he quit during the '60s or '70s or
'80s? Because he didn't have any interest in it.
What happened on the few occasions when he did try?
He testified about this, and Dr. Grunberg testified to a few
other, again not specific, not tied to any time frame but
just generally mentioning.
Well, we know about -- we know about that he used
the gum for a while for two or three days. We don't know of
any specifics of that. He said he tried acupuncture, but he
was smoking 15 minutes later. No time frame, no specifics of
that. He told us under oath here that he tried hypnosis, but
in his deposition he said he didn't do it.
The legal cause of him not -- of him continuing to
smoke was his decision to smoke, not addiction.
Dr. Grunberg told you that a smoker is not going to
quit until he has decided he's going to quit. A person who
is motivated to quit smoking, he told us, is more likely to
11:46:19
11:46:23
11:46:26
11:46:29
11:46:31
11:46:34

11:46:42

11:47:40
11:47:43
11:47:48
11:47:51
101 succeed than someone who is not motivated. Determination is
an important factor. The determination like he had in 2005
when he made up that very strong mind of his that he was
going to stop smoking; when his doctor told him that if he
didn't quit smoking, he had only six months to live, and we
know what he did. He made up his mind, I'm determined. I'm
going to quit, and he stuck with it, and he did it cold
turkey. He could have done those things earlier but he
didn't.
Now, let me take a step back. This is important.
I know I speak for Ms. Patterson. Nothing that I am saying
is meant to convey any disrespect of Mr. Kerrivan or in any
way criticize the decisions and choices he made. He had the
right to make the decisions that he did about his smoking,
about everything else that he did in life. He had the right
to continue smoking if he wanted to. Those were his
decisions, nobody else's; but he is the one who is
responsible for them.
And as Dr. Koop -- we showed you that excerpt from
Dr. Koop, that famous Surgeon General, who said, as he was
advising people, this is his words: "Ultimately, you are the
one that has control over your behavior. The cigarette is
not going to light itself and jump into your mouth nor are
you going to go into a brain-induced trance and light the
cigarette. No matter how much you have smoked or how much
11:47:55
11:48:00
11:48:04
11:48:08
11:48:12
11:48:15
11:48:18
11:48:22
11:48:29
11:48:30
11:48:34
11:48:39
11:48:44
11:48:48
11:48:53
11:48:58
11:49:00
11:49:03
11:49:03
11:49:07
11:49:13
11:49:17
11:49:21
11:49:25
11:49:29
102 you like to smoke, the choice to light up is always yours."
So I respectfully suggest to you that the answer to
question two is "no." If Mr. Kerrivan had quit smoking, he
likely would not have developed COPD, and he has not proven
that his addiction was a legal cause of his COPD.
There was some reference to question three. The
only thing I would comment there is that I think there was a
suggestion by Ms. London that you can use the findings to
decide question three. I encourage you to look at your
instructions. And what you will find is that the findings
don't come into play until after question three. You will
see that in your instructions.
I do want to spend some time with questions four
through seven on what will be your Verdict Form, and these
are questions dealing with concealment and conspiracy,
concealment and conspiracy.
I'll read the questions to you and then you will
see them.
Question four says this: "Please state as to each
defendant whether Kenneth Kerrivan justifiably relied to his
detriment on statements made by one or more defendants that
concealed or omitted material information concerning the
health effects and/or the addictive nature of cigarette
smoking. And if so, whether Kenneth Kerrivan's reliance was
a legal cause of his COPD."
11:49:33
11:49:36
11:49:39
11:49:45
11:49:49
11:49:53
11:49:58
11:50:01
11:50:04
11:50:08
11:50:11
11:50:14
11:50:15
11:50:19
11:50:23
11:50:27
11:50:28
11:50:30
11:50:31
11:50:36
11:50:40
11:50:47
11:50:51
11:50:56
11:51:01
103 Then question six, which is the conspiracy claim,
says: "Please state as to each defendant whether Kenneth
Kerrivan justifiably relied to his detriment on statements
made in furtherance of that defendant's agreement with other
tobacco companies or entities to conceal or omit material
information concerning the health effects and/or addictive
nature of cigarette smoking. And if so, whether Mr.
Kerrivan's reliance was a legal cause of his COPD."
Now, let's talk about reliance. The question is,
let's talk about reliance. Did Mr. Kerrivan rely? We've
heard a lot of evidence about what Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds did, and we've heard a lot of evidence about
what the American public knew or didn't know.
But when you get -- if you get to this point in the
Verdict Form, this is a question you have to answer about Mr.
Kerrivan: What statements affected Mr. Kerrivan? What did
he rely upon to his detriment?
Another thing to focus on is any reliance under the
law must be justifiable. In other words, Mr. Kerrivan would
have to justifiably rely on a statement that concealed or
omitted material information about the health effects or
addictive nature of smoking.
Judge Erickson instructed you at the outset of the
case, and you'll have those instructions along with the ones
he gave yesterday, that reliance is not justifiable if the
11:51:05
11:51:09
11:51:14
11:51:18
11:51:23
11:51:28
11:51:32
11:51:38
11:51:42
11:51:46
11:51:50
11:51:53
11:51:56
11:51:59
11:52:02
11:52:08
11:52:12
11:52:16
11:52:21
11:52:27
11:52:31
11:52:38
11:52:39
11:52:43
11:52:45
104 falsity of the statement was known to Mr. Kerrivan or was
obvious to him.
The plaintiff never brought you any evidence that
Mr. Kerrivan heard any statement from a tobacco company, much
less relied on any statement from a tobacco company.
Certainly nothing after May 5, 1982.
Now, the plaintiff's experts spent considerable
time talking about how bad cigarettes as a product are and
how bad the cigarette industry was. And if you get to this
point in the Verdict Form, you will have that finding from
that previous jury about the past conduct of the cigarette
industry. That's as it goes.
But there was never any connection in the evidence
in this case to Mr. Kerrivan. And let me talk just for a
moment, let me stop for a moment and talk about Dr. Proctor.
One of the instructions that Judge Erickson gave you
yesterday was specifically addressing the testimony of expert
witnesses, and he told you that the law is this: "When a
witness has been or will be paid for reviewing and testifying
concerning the evidence, you may consider the possibility of
bias and should view with caution the testimony of such a
witness where court testimony is given with regularity and
represents a significant portion of the witness' income."
Dr. Proctor has made over $2 million testifying in
tobacco trials, $1.7 million of that is in the last six
11:52:49
11:52:54
11:52:56
11:52:59
11:53:04
11:53:08
11:53:12
11:53:16
11:53:20
11:53:26
11:53:28
11:53:33
11:53:36
11:53:40
11:53:45
11:53:49
11:53:52
11:53:57
11:54:02
11:54:06
11:54:10
11:54:16
11:54:22
11:54:26
11:54:31
105 years. He's testified in 50 trials. This year he's
testified 33 times, 17 in trials like this, six times in --
16 times in depositions. In the last five years, he's
testified 130 times.
He told you that a substantial portion of his
income, it comes from testifying.
The law says under these circumstances you should
view his testimony with caution. And you can consider that
and should consider that when you decide how much weight to
give to his testimony, how much investment he's got.
But even more important, perhaps, than the money is
the other reason these experts are here. Dr. Grunberg told
you that he wants all cigarettes containing nicotine removed
from the market.
Dr. Proctor told you loud and clear he wants
cigarettes banned.
And in one of the important motives for this work
that he does, day in and day out, in courtrooms everywhere,
is that he testifies to put cigarette companies out of
business and to do that by convincing juries like you to
award high verdicts to plaintiffs because that would provide
an additional tax on cigarettes and push them towards being
out of business.
He doesn't know anything about Mr. Kerrivan. He
didn't read the first thing about him, never a deposition,
11:54:36
11:54:41
11:54:48
11:54:51
11:54:54
11:54:57
11:55:01
11:55:03
11:55:08
11:55:11
11:55:15
11:55:21
11:55:23
11:55:27
11:55:28
11:55:33
11:55:34
11:55:37
11:55:42
11:55:46
11:55:50
11:55:56
11:56:00
11:56:00
11:56:05
106 never a medical record.
Dr. Gravelyn told you that he wants cigarettes
taken off the market.
These experts make it clear that they think it is
simply irrational to smoke cigarettes because cigarettes
carry risk. And even though we all make decisions every day
about how much risk we're willing to take from the foods we
eat to the way we drive cars to what cars we drive, we decide
what level of risk we're comfortable with.
And they make it sound irrational that cigarettes
should even be legal. They want you to hate the product, but
they are legal. It's the way we've -- it's the decision that
we've made, and you have an instruction that the manufacture
and sale of cigarettes is lawful.
Now, it's okay for these experts to --
MR. BYRD: Objection, Your Honor; improper
argument.
THE COURT: Approach at side bar here.
(Bench conference as follows.)
MR. BYRD: Your Honor, there's no other reason to
be making this argument that we've decided in this country
that cigarettes are legal and to read that part of the
instruction only. I would ask for an instruction that
regardless of whether they are legal or not, they still may
be held liable for their conduct, and it's an improper
11:56:11
11:56:13
11:56:17
11:56:19
11:56:23
11:56:26

11:57:36
11:57:39
11:57:43
11:57:47
107 argument. We have an order on it. And it shouldn't be made.
And it gives them -- it gives the jury this idea that somehow
the fact that they're legal -- this is argument on whether he
should they should be held liable or not -- the defendants
should be held liable or not. That's what the argument is
all about.
MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, it's argument about the
bias of these witnesses, which just can -- I'm done with that
portion of it. It has to do with the bias of the experts.
This is all argument about their bias.
THE COURT: So far what I heard was, in fact, tied
to the bias of these witnesses.
Now, the fact that their legal product is in front
of this jury, the fact that they could be held accountable
for the sale of this little -- legal product is pretty plain
to these jurors at this point.
You're going to get a chance for rebuttal.
If Mr. Davis goes back into this, I'm going to stop
it, because I think whatever legitimate purpose is there --
and we're done with this part of it, because it is an area
that is, in fact, fraught with danger. So we're done with
this, and we'll move on to the next thing.
MR. DAVIS: Thank you.
(In open court.)
THE COURT: You may proceed.

11:59:08
108 MR. DAVIS: People do have different feelings about
cigarettes and cigarette companies. Dr. Gravelyn, for
example, said he saw value. He didn't see value in it, but
he saw others that did and recognized that others do.
But the important thing is that those feelings are
not something that you carry into the jury box. And you have
made that commitment in your oath that whatever attitudes you
have, all of which are fine to have, are not something that
will drive your decision.
The question here is about whether, first, Mr.
Kerrivan actually heard and justifiably relied upon a
statement of the defendants that omitted information,
concealed information about the health effects of smoking or
it's addictive nature, and whether that was a legal cause of
his smoking.
Now, you know that nothing a tobacco company did
affected or said affected Mr. Kerrivan's decision to start
smoking.
Let me turn very briefly to advertising. Dr.
Proctor showed you ads, and he talked to you about
advertising, but what's the evidence with respect to Mr.
Kerrivan? What does that have to do with him?
We know that Mr. Kerrivan did not start smoking
because of ads. He started smoking because his friend Leon
del Marco at a bus stop was a smoker, gave him a cigarette,
11:59:09
11:59:12
11:59:15
11:59:20
11:59:22
11:59:27
11:59:32
11:59:37
11:59:39
11:59:49
11:59:52
11:59:56
12:00:00
12:00:03
12:00:08
12:00:09
12:00:16
12:00:20
12:00:21
12:00:27
12:00:30
12:00:34
12:00:37
12:00:41
12:00:46
109 taught him how to inhale.
We know that ads didn't influence his brand choice.
You heard he wasn't -- he testified he was not paying
attention to Marlboro ads because he knew what he wanted and
he wanted Marlboro. He wanted them, he told us, because
everybody else was smoking them, and he liked the way they
taste -- tasted. He liked the cigarette.
And the fact is that the evidence is that
Mr. Kerrivan chose and based his decisions on what cigarette
to smoke based on his experience using the product, not
looking at ads. He only smoked the brands that he liked the
taste of. And if he didn't like the cigarette, he would move
on and he wouldn't buy that brand again.
Now, take that story about Kools. He remembered
the ad with the penguin, and I think that was one of the ads
that Dr. Proctor showed you. And he remembered it. But he
said he tried the cigarette. He thought it might be easy on
his throat, but he tasted one cigarette, and he hated it. He
called it a joke cigarette. He said it tasted like a York
Peppermint Pattie. And he threw away the rest of the pack
and never smoked another one.
Mr. Kerrivan was not relying on any cigarette
advertisements to decide what brands to smoke. And we know
he didn't smoke lights because of ads. There was never a
television ad at all for Marlboro Lights. And when we asked
12:00:50
12:00:52

110 him whether he could remember any advertisements for light
cigarettes, he said he couldn't remember.
We know that Mr. Kerrivan knew from way back when
that smoking was dangerous. We went through all those dates
on the timeline. And he admitted that he heard cigarettes
were dangerous when all the warnings went on the packs in
1996.
Mr. Kerrivan didn't rely on anything Philip Morris
or R.J. Reynolds said because he already knew from his
experiences in life that cigarettes were dangerous. He knew
that cigarettes could be dangerous to his health both before
and after 1982.
And let me talk about one other theory that was
alluded to. And somehow, plaintiff suggested to you that
Philip Morris that makes Marlboro Lights fooled Mr. Kerrivan
into switching to lights, that the word "lights" on the pack
and the representation on the pack that it has lower tar and
nicotine somehow defrauded him.
Now, the plaintiff's experts, and you heard them,
testified that one of the reasons that they think light
cigarettes are generally misleading is that smokers assume
they are safer. But this case is not about smokers in
general. It's about Mr. Kerrivan.
Mr. Kerrivan never testified, and there is no
evidence in this case, that he switched to lights because he
12:02:30
12:02:33
12:02:36
12:02:40
12:02:43
12:02:46
12:02:50
12:02:50
12:02:54
12:02:59
12:03:03
12:03:07
12:03:09
12:03:11
12:03:17

12:03:46
12:03:52
12:03:54
12:03:58
111 thought they were safer. He was asked, in fact, by
Miss London if he thought if he switched to lights, he would
get less bad stuff; and he said no.
He testified that he switched to lights, again, at
some point. There's no tie in time to any of this. We just
don't know. No specificity at all about when he smoked
lights. But he switched at some point, we don't know when,
because he thought they had less tar and nicotine, and he
thought they would help him quit.
There is no evidence that any tobacco company ever
said anything to Mr. Kerrivan or that Mr. Kerrivan saw
anything or heard anything from a tobacco company that if you
switch to light cigarettes, it will help you quit.
And we know from Mr. Kerrivan's experience that he
understood the lights and ultra light cigarettes that he did
smoke did have less tar and nicotine. How do we know that?
Because Mr. Kerrivan told us that immediately when he
switched to light cigarettes, he smoked more cigarettes. He
immediately knew that they weren't helping him quit.
And then when he went from -- he went from Marlboro
Lights to Marlboro Ultra Lights because he said he was
looking for a lighter cigarette.
And he smoked even more ultra lights than he smoked
lights. And he realized this is not helping me quit, and he
testified then he went back and smoked Marlboro Reds, now,
12:04:00
12:04:09
12:04:11
12:04:16
12:04:20
12:04:24
12:04:27
12:04:31

12:05:11
12:05:17
12:05:21

12:05:29
12:05:31
12:05:35
12:05:39
112 again, the regular cigarette. And again, there's no evidence
in this.
But, folks, he got exactly what he bought and was
looking for. He got a cigarette with lower tar and nicotine,
and he smoked more of those to get the nicotine that he
wanted and to get, as he described it, the kick that he
wanted.
All right. I think he said that he smoked about a
pack a day more with the lights and that it went up even more
with the ultras. And then when he went back to the reds --
the ultras, he said he was getting nothing out of them. Do
you remember that testimony? Then he went back to the reds,
and he was smoking a lot fewer cigarettes.
Now, Dr. Proctor, who has never designed a
cigarette in his natural life, told you that lights don't
work because people don't smoke like robots. They cover up
the vent holes. They get just as much tar and nicotine from
lights as they do from regular cigarettes, that whole thing
of compensation that makes them dangerous and unsafe.
Whatever that may be for somebody else's case, that is not
Mr. Kerrivan.
He got much less tar and nicotine from the lights
he smoked. He knew it. He recognized it consciously. He
knew immediately that's what was happening. He smoked more
of them to get what he wanted, and then he went back to the
12:05:44
12:05:47
12:05:48
12:05:52
12:05:57
12:06:02
12:06:05
12:06:06
12:06:15
12:06:19
12:06:23
12:06:27
12:06:29
12:06:31
12:06:35
12:06:38
12:06:43
12:06:47
12:06:51
12:06:55

12:06:59
12:07:02
12:07:06
12:07:09
113 reds. He was not fooled by light cigarettes.
He understood he was smoking more. It's like
buying light beer and drinking twice the amount and saying,
I'm still getting the same amount of calories. You would
know that.
There is not evidence in this case of Mr. Kerrivan
being defrauded by a statement from Philip Morris about light
cigarettes.
And the other thing is that he never testified at
all that he switched to light cigarettes instead of quitting.
He never said he went to the -- he said he went to the lights
and the ultra lights because he believed, for whatever
reason, but certainly not from a tobacco company, that it
would help him quit. And he knew instantly, as I say, they
were doing just the opposite because he was smoking more.
So what reliance -- no reliance there.
So let's go back and think about what Mr. Kerrivan
and what he knew about smoking. He knew smoking was
dangerous from the time the first warnings went on the pack.
All cigarettes had the same warning, regardless of the brand.
And he was being told to quit smoking by his doctors,
regardless of what brand of cigarettes he was smoking.
He knew what he needed to know about the risks of
smoking. There is no evidence in this case that he relied on
any statement -- justifiably relied from any statement to
12:07:13
12:07:16
12:07:20
12:07:25
12:07:28
12:07:28
12:07:32
12:07:36
12:07:37
12:07:45
12:07:51
12:07:53
12:07:56
12:07:59
12:08:05
12:08:07
12:08:10
12:08:13
12:08:16
12:08:20
12:08:23
12:08:26
12:08:29
12:08:33
12:08:37
114 make the decisions he made.
And remember that even if he justifiably relied on
a statement, that reliance has to be the legal cause of his
COPD. And it's the same definition -- I think Miss London
mentioned this. It's the same definition of legal cause that
you see in the other instructions. It means that if the
legal cause -- if something is a legal cause of a person's
injury, it means but for that something, the injury wouldn't
have happened.
And in this context, what that means is even if you
could find that Mr. Kerrivan justifiably relied on a
statement from a tobacco company, the question is whether he
would have quit smoking and avoided his COPD if only he
hadn't relied on that statement. And there is no evidence,
as I've discussed, that Mr. Kerrivan would have quit at any
time had he heard something different from a tobacco company.
There is no evidence that Mr. Kerrivan made any
decision about his smoking in reliance on any anything that
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds said, and there's no evidence
that he would have quit smoking were it not for that
reliance.
Mr. Kerrivan was not waiting to hear something from
Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds to tell him what he had known
for decades, that smoking is dangerous to your health.
So I respectfully suggest to you that your answer

12:10:03
12:10:07
12:10:10
115 to questions four through seven on the Verdict Form must be
"no" based on the evidence in the case. Plaintiff has failed
to prove that Mr. Kerrivan justifiably relied, to his
detriment, on any allegedly misleading statement made either
before or after 1982 or that his reliance was a legal cause
of his COPD.
Question eight deals with comparative fault. I
don't know if you'll get to this question; but if you do,
then you have to decide what percentage of fault you allocate
to Mr. Kerrivan, to Philip Morris and to R.J. Reynolds.
The Court has instructed you that Mr. Kerrivan's
own acts or omissions are a legal cause of his COPD, a legal
cause. But as you think about this question, I suggest to
you the question is, who was making the decisions? All of
plaintiff's experts told you that it's up to the smoker to
try to quit.
Mr. Kerrivan never tried to quit in the '60s and
'70s. He says he was not motivated to quit in the '80s.
Folks, all that other testimony about the quits
that we all heard for the first time in this court, recall
bias, sometimes when you look back as you get along in age,
you wish things had happened differently to the point that
you think they did.
And Dr. Grunberg, after all his review of the
record and interview of Mr. Kerrivan, found only two specific
12:10:13
12:10:16
12:10:22
12:10:26
12:10:31
12:10:37
12:10:38
12:10:43
12:10:45
12:10:49
12:10:54
12:10:58
12:11:03
12:11:09
12:11:14
12:11:17
12:11:18
12:11:23
12:11:27
12:11:29
12:11:33
12:11:40
12:11:43
12:11:46
12:11:50
116 documented attempts that we've talked about: the patch and
the final quit. And when he did decide to quit, he was able
to quit both times, both with the patch and the final quit.
If you get to this question, the evidence suggests
that you should attribute 100 percent of the fault to
Mr. Kerrivan, because he was the only person that could have
made the decision to quit smoking. He was the only person
who could have made the effort to quit. His smoking
decisions were his.
Question nine deals with damages. And if you get
to question nine, you're going to be asked to award some
amount of damages.
I cannot tell you how to answer this question. Mr.
Byrd has asked you to award $10 million. It's an arbitrary
number. It comes from nowhere, the best I can tell. And
it's a lot of money.
And I'm going to remind you of Judge Erickson's
instructions here. Compensatory damages must not be based on
speculation or guesswork. Only actual damages are
recoverable.
There's no claim in this case for medical expenses.
There's no claim in this case for lost earnings. The damages
that he is seeking, as Mr. Byrd showed you in that
instruction, are from injuries -- damages like his injury and
the resulting pain and suffering and mental anguish from his
12:11:55
12:11:59
12:12:02
12:12:07
12:12:10
12:12:13
12:12:17
12:12:22
12:12:26
12:12:28
12:12:32
12:12:35
12:12:37
12:12:39
12:12:42
12:12:47
12:12:48
12:12:53
12:12:57
12:13:00
12:13:01
12:13:03
12:13:06
12:13:09
12:13:14
117 injuries.
Now, no matter what number Mr. Byrd has asked you
for, Judge Erickson has instructed you that any compensatory
damages you should award should be the amount you, as the
judges of the facts, find to be justified by a preponderance
of the evidence as full, just and reasonable compensation for
all of plaintiff's COPD damages. No more and no less.
As Judge Erickson has told you, compensatory
damages are not allowed as punishment and must not be imposed
to increase or penalize -- they must not be imposed or
increased to penalize R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris.
Question ten. This last question on your Verdict
Form, if you get there, is going to deal with punitive
damages. And the first thing I want to be sure is that
everybody understands exactly what's at issue there. And if
you reach that point, what you are asked to decide is
whether, under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Kerrivan
may be entitled to more money for punitive damages.
If your answer is yes, then as we've discussed,
there will be another phase of the trial. There will be more
evidence. There will be arguments. And you will have a
separate deliberation on the amount, if any, that you award.
So at this stage, it's not -- the amount of
punitive damages is not for your consideration.
What you're to focus on is whether the plaintiff
12:13:17
12:13:17
12:13:21
12:13:26
12:13:31
12:13:35
12:13:40
12:13:45
12:13:48
12:13:54
12:13:59
12:14:03
12:14:07
12:14:11
12:14:14
12:14:20
12:14:21
12:14:27
12:14:32
12:14:36
12:14:38
12:14:40
12:14:45
12:14:48
12:14:52
118 has proved to you by clear and convincing evidence that he is
entitled to punitive damages, whether he's entitled to more
money beyond what he receives, if he does receive any, for
compensation.
Now, when you look at the instructions, you will
see that clear and convincing evidence is defined. It is a
much higher standard of proof than preponderance of the
evidence.
With respect to punitive damages, you will see this
language: "The evidence must be compelling and persuasive.
It has to be precise, explicit, lacking in confusion and of
such weight that it produces a firm belief or conviction,
without hesitation, about the matter in issue."
It's a much higher standard. I think you heard
that.
You have to be really, really convinced that
punitive damages are appropriate.
And let me tell you something else. You have to
decide, if you get there, that punitive damages are warranted
based on the conduct that harmed Mr. Kerrivan, not the
general public, not the rest of the world, not to all other
smokers.
MR. BYRD: Objection, Your Honor. That's not
exactly true.
THE COURT: You may approach. Let's talk about it

[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
MR. DAVIS: Folks, let's go back to punitive
damages. The starting point for your determination, the
starting point of punitive damages, is to look at the conduct
that caused harm to Mr. Kerrivan. And then, as you know from
the instructions, you move on to those other questions in the
Verdict Form -- I mean, in the instructions that deal with
the other issues. That was my only point.
If you look at those instructions, that's where you
start. It's not necessarily where you end. The instructions
say what they say.
Now, let me suggest to you that as to punitive
damages, this is a high standard that plaintiff has not met.
There is no evidence that Mr. Kerrivan always had the --
there's evidence that Mr. Kerrivan always had the information
he needed to make an informed decision about whether to
try -- to continue smoking or whether to try to quit.
Mr. Kerrivan did not rely on anything from the
tobacco companies to make his decision to start smoking or to
continue smoking.
I respectfully suggest to you there is no clear and
convincing evidence in this case warranting the imposition of
punitive damages on Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds. And I
respectfully suggest that the answer to that question is no.

12:24:55

12:25:04
126 I want to wrap up by thanking you for your
diligence and your patience. This is an important case to
Mr. Kerrivan. It's an important case to R.J. Reynolds and to
Philip Morris.
We absolutely respect Mr. Kerrivan's right to bring
this case. I've been part of this system for 40 years. I am
very proud to be in a system where an individual citizen can
bring two big companies into federal court and make a claim
in a case against a jury drawn from the community. I'm very
proud of that.
And that system works because we have -- we go
through the process that we went through a week from last
Monday to select folks that can absolutely decide the case
without bias or sympathy or prejudice or sentiment; and when
that happens, whatever the outcome, the result is the truth
and the result is justice.
I stood up in opening. The first thing I said to
you, and the things I've said today is that this case is
about Mr. Kerrivan. I respectfully suggest to you that he
has failed to prove his case. He has not proved his
addiction was so strong that but for that addiction, he would
have quit smoking and avoided his injury. He has not proved
that, because when he made up his mind to quit, he quit.
Now, I don't get a chance -- because the plaintiff
has the burden of proof, this is the last time that I will
12:25:07
12:25:09
12:25:13
12:25:17
12:25:17

12:26:22
12:26:24
127 have a chance to talk with you. Ms. Patterson will make her
presentation on behalf of Reynolds, and then Mr. Byrd gets a
chance to make a rebuttal presentation, and that's the
process since they have the burden of proof.
So I'm not going to have a chance to get up and
offer any more thoughts, but I would ask that maybe as you're
listening to Mr. Byrd, you don't know what he's going to say,
you might think, "I wonder what Mr. Davis might ask or say if
he were listening to this and had a chance to talk," and I
don't know, but you know what I'm guessing it would be? What
on earth does this have to do with Mr. Kerrivan?
Now, Mr. Kerrivan is the only person in the world
who can make a decision to smoke or try to quit. Those were
his decisions that he made during his lifetime knowing the
risk of smoking, and those decisions should not be
disrespected or second guessed in this courtroom. Those were
his decisions.
And it's those decisions, though, that he is
seeking as the basis for you to award him a substantial
amount of money.
I truly appreciate the opportunity to have made
this presentation. I thank you for your attention. Thank
you for all your hard work. It's been a real privilege to
try this case in front of you. Thank you.


MS. PATTERSON: May it please the Court.
Counsel.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's a
pleasure to speak with you all again on behalf of R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company.
First, I want to join the others in sincerely
thanking you for your service. I want to thank you
personally and on behalf of my client.
Now, during opening statements, I said that you
wouldn't hear from me a lot during this trial, and the first
reason was because Mr. Davis was going to go first and cover
the main points, and I wanted to be respectful of your time
and not waste it.

12:28:39
12:28:42
12:28:44
12:28:46
12:28:50
12:28:53
12:28:55
12:28:59
129 Now, Mr. Davis just thoroughly walked you through
the evidence, and what he said applies with equal force to
Reynolds. So I'm not going to repeat that.
But you also didn't hear from me a lot during this
trial because Mr. Kerrivan only smoked Reynolds' products for
a very brief amount of time. And that's very important,
because the law requires you to determine whether smoking
Reynolds' cigarettes legally caused Mr. Kerrivan's COPD.
The evidence has shown that Reynolds' cigarettes
did not contribute substantially to Mr. Kerrivan's COPD
because he would have developed COPD, even if he'd never
touched a Reynolds' cigarette, and because the amount of
Reynolds' cigarettes that he smoked was not enough to cause
his COPD. So I want to focus on that this afternoon.
The evidence has shown that to the extent Mr.
Kerrivan smoked Reynolds' cigarettes, it was very brief, and
it was a long time ago. And Mr. Kerrivan's Reynolds smoking
was only a very, very small part of his total smoking. It
did not substantially contribute.
So Mr. Kerrivan talked about two Reynolds' brands.
He talked about Lucky Strike, and he talked about Camel.
We heard that Mr. Kerrivan had made the decision to
smoke before he ever smoked a Reynolds' brand. Before he
ever smoked a Reynolds' brand, he had already been smoking
with his friend Leon del Marco, and he had already started
12:29:01
12:29:05
12:29:08
12:29:10
12:29:14
12:29:18
12:29:22
12:29:27
12:29:29
12:29:33
12:29:37
12:29:40
12:29:43
12:29:46
12:29:50
12:29:55
12:29:57
12:30:01
12:30:06
12:30:07
12:30:11
12:30:15
12:30:18
12:30:22
12:30:25
130 stealing cigarettes from his uncle, those L&M cigarettes.
We heard that Mr. Kerrivan smoked his first Lucky
Strike after he had already moved out of his aunt and uncle's
home. He was living on his own. He was supporting himself.
He was working, and he was earning a living installing
aluminum siding.
Now, Mr. Kerrivan's testimony about how much and
how long he smoked Reynolds' cigarettes is very conflicting.
There's what he said under oath at his deposition before
trial ever started, and then there's what he said this week
at trial.
And I want to talk about that. But before I do, I
want to be very, very clear about something. I'm talking
about Mr. Kerrivan's testimony because he brought this
lawsuit, and he's asking for money damages, but nothing I say
is intended in any way to criticize Mr. Kerrivan.
Now, before trial, Mr. Kerrivan answered questions
at something called a deposition, and you've heard a little
bit about depositions from Judge Erickson here at trial. And
he's told you that at a deposition, the witness is sworn
under oath, and he's sworn to tell the truth, and that's just
like if he were in a courtroom where we all are here today.
And we asked Mr. Kerrivan about his Reynolds
smoking, and that was our chance to find out the facts before
this trial ever started.
12:30:31
12:30:34
12:30:37
12:30:41
12:30:44
12:30:48
12:30:49
12:30:53
12:30:58
12:31:00
12:31:03
12:31:04
12:31:08
12:31:11
12:31:15
12:31:19
12:31:22
12:31:28
12:31:31
12:31:34
12:31:37
12:31:40
12:31:44
12:31:48
12:31:51
131 And it was Mr. Kerrivan's chance to tell his story.
But once we got to trial, we heard something very,
very different than what we heard during his deposition, and
that's why I played the deposition testimony for you all, so
that you could hear it for yourself.
Now, the judge has instructed you about evaluating
a witness' credibility. And when you make determinations
about a witness' credibility, one of the things that you
should ask yourself is whether there is evidence that at some
other time a witness said something that was different from
the testimony the witness gave at trial.
Now, Mr. Kerrivan's testimony at trial was very
different than that sworn testimony that you saw at his
deposition. There's no question about that.
And Judge Erickson has also told you that the
significance of your decision may depend on whether the
misstatement is about an important fact or about an
unimportant detail.
Let me be very, very clear about this. The amount
of Reynolds smoking that Mr. Kerrivan did is a very important
fact to my client.
So with that in mind, let's talk about Mr.
Kerrivan's Reynolds smoking. Start with Lucky Strike.
Now, when Mr. Kerrivan's lawyers asked him at
trial, he said he initially smoked Lucky Strike for a couple
12:31:53
12:31:57
12:32:01
12:32:05
12:32:08
12:32:10
12:32:14
12:32:18
12:32:22
12:32:25
12:32:30
12:32:32
12:32:35
12:32:38
12:32:41
12:32:45
12:32:48
12:32:52
12:32:54
12:32:57
12:33:02
12:33:04
12:33:07
12:33:11
12:33:14
132 years. He said maybe even four, but he didn't seem sure.
So on cross-examination, I had a chance to ask him,
"Are you sure it wasn't just one year of Lucky Strike? You
testified at your deposition that you smoked Lucky Strike for
one year." And that was under oath.
And he said, "Okay. One year sounds about right."
I suggest that the evidence about Mr. Kerrivan's
Lucky Strike smoking was that he only smoked Lucky Strike for
about one year.
Now, let's talk about Camel. When Mr. Kerrivan was
asked by his lawyer at trial, he said, "I'd be guessing. I
probably smoked Camels for -- maybe I smoked them for ten
years."
This was a huge change in Mr. Kerrivan's testimony,
and that's why I showed it to you all so that you could see
it for yourself.
So on my cross-examination, I asked him about that,
and I asked him about the fact that at his deposition he said
he only smoked one pack of Camel.
And Mr. Kerrivan said, "You misunderstood me. I
smoked one pack a day, not one pack total."
So let's see if that explanation makes sense.
On cross-exam, I played Mr. Kerrivan's deposition
about Camel, and the very first question was --
MR. BYRD: Objection, Your Honor; local rule,
12:33:18
12:33:21

133 transcript reading. Can we approach?
THE COURT: Yes.
(Bench conference as follows.)
MR. BYRD: The Middle District of Florida is clear,
and the judges in this district have been very strong on us
and harsh on us that you cannot read from transcripts in
closing argument. It's a clear rule. And it may sound like
a strange rule to Your Honor, but it has been vigorously
enforced on both sides, and that's what the Middle District
of Florida rules say.
THE COURT: Does someone have a copy of this local
rule?
it.
MR. BYRD: I'm sure Ms. Patterson agrees it says
MS. PATTERSON: The local rule says that you're not
allowed to put testimony up on the screen or suggest to the
jury that they should request the testimony to go back.
MR. BYRD: I think it's stronger than that, but I
guess we need a copy of it.
MR. DAVIS: Just for my own take on this, I agree
that there are rules of procedure in the local rules of where
you stand, where you sit, what you say. There's a pretty
detailed set of those.
But I don't think you're bound by it. I honestly
don't. I think this is Fargo, North Dakota, Your Honor. I

12:36:16
12:36:19
12:36:20
12:36:22
134 mean, honestly, this is your decision, how you run your
courtroom.
These judges, it's a matter of their local process
of -- I'll tell you they've gotten pretty persnickety about a
bunch of stuff in there, and we don't tend to worry about
that too much with a visiting judge because we kind of follow
what the visiting judge wants us to do.
So I think this is what your practice is. I mean,
there will be something on this. I haven't thought about
this much, but there will be something in here, but it's your
call.
MR. BYRD: I honestly didn't think they would do
it. We've had several judges come down on us about this. I
didn't have to have the rule.
MR. DAVIS: District judges will try you. I've had
it.
other day.
MR. BYRD: Judge Dalton, we had to hear from the
THE COURT: One at a time.
MR. DAVIS: Judge Dalton is very strict about some
of this stuff.
MR. BYRD: That's why I don't do it. I mean, I
would have done it.
THE COURT: I wish somebody would have brought this
local rule to my attention before, because I think that would
12:36:26
12:36:29
12:36:29
12:36:33
12:36:38
12:36:41
12:36:44
12:36:46
12:36:50
12:36:53
12:36:56
12:36:58
12:37:00
12:37:04
12:37:04
12:37:06
12:37:07
12:37:13
12:37:13
12:37:14
12:37:18
12:37:19
12:37:41
12:37:42
12:37:44
135 have come up with a very different ruling. I would have
said, "I just don't buy that rule."
Here's what I think you can do. You can paraphrase
the testimony. You should not read it, because I think at
this point if it was a local rule -- it certainly is a local
rule -- people would have -- may have relied on it, and it's
just not quite kosher. So that's how I see it.
MS. PATTERSON: Okay. I can rephrase it.
(In open court.)
THE COURT: You may proceed, Ms. Patterson.
MS. PATTERSON: So after -- after Mr. Kerrivan was
asking if he ever smoked Camel -- he was asked a simple
question that was an open-ended question. I didn't suggest
an answer. He didn't even ask how much or how long or how
many. I just asked him: "Did you ever smoke Camel?"
And I respectfully suggest that Mr. Kerrivan's
testimony was that he tried. He tried them, and that was Mr.
Kerrivan's opportunity to say that he smoked Camels for a
long time. That was his opportunity to say that he smoked
Camel for ten years, but he didn't say that. All he said was
that he tried.
So let's think about those words for a minute,
"tried." You don't try something for ten years. That's like
the difference between going out and test driving a car. You
go to the dealership. You do a test drive. You try it out
12:37:47
12:37:49
12:37:55
12:37:58
12:38:00
12:38:03
12:38:07
12:38:14
12:38:29
12:38:29
12:38:33
12:38:39
12:38:45
12:38:48
12:38:52
12:38:56
12:39:00
12:39:06
12:39:09
12:39:13
12:39:18
12:39:19
12:39:22
12:39:28
12:39:32
136 versus going out and buying a car, driving it every single
day, and then keeping that same car for the next ten years.
That's not trying something.
Now, the next question that he was asked, he asked
how long was he smoking these Camel cigarettes, and that's
where Mr. Kerrivan said maybe one pack.
And then you saw the deposition that was played,
and I believe that it said something to the effect of, "So
all the Camel cigarettes that you smoked, it was just the one
pack?"
Then again Mr. Kerrivan said, "Yes."
So that was the second opportunity for Mr. Kerrivan
to tell you that he smoked Camel for any substantial amount
of time. That was the second opportunity for Mr. Kerrivan to
tell you that he smoked Camel for ten years.
MR. BYRD: Objection to the deposition, what
depositions are intended for, for opportunities or not, for
the witness.
THE COURT: All right. I'm going to overrule the
objection.
on.
I think it's been covered, though. You may move
MS. PATTERSON: Okay.
And then I also showed some testimony and asked Mr.
Kerrivan some questions about the progression of his
12:39:37
12:39:40
12:39:45
12:39:48
12:39:52
12:39:56
12:39:58
12:40:02
12:40:06
12:40:09
12:40:10
12:40:12
12:40:19
12:40:23
12:40:26
12:40:28
12:40:32
12:40:36
12:40:37
12:40:40
12:40:41
12:40:44
12:40:44
12:40:45
12:40:49
137 cigarettes, the cigarettes that he smoked. And Mr. Kerrivan
was asked about Lucky Strike smoking and about what the next
cigarette that he smoked after Lucky Strike was, and that was
Marlboro. That was another chance to hear something about
Camel that we didn't hear.
I also showed another videotaped deposition clip,
and during that part, we were asking Mr. Kerrivan about his
regular brands; and we heard about Lucky Strike and we heard
about Marlboro and we heard about Marlboro Lights, but there
was no mention of Camel.
So all that we heard prior to the testimony this
week from Mr. Kerrivan was that he smoked one pack of Camel.
So four times under oath at his deposition he didn't tell us
anything other than the fact that he smoked one pack of
Camel.
Now, that's a summary of the extent of the
testimony about Mr. Kerrivan's brands that he smoked made by
my client.
And Mr. Kerrivan's Reynolds smoking did not
substantially contribute to his COPD. And I believe that
there are a few different ways that you can come to that
determination.
First, you can believe Mr. Kerrivan's sworn
deposition testimony when he said four times under oath that
he only smoked Camel for -- one pack of Camel and that he
12:40:54
12:40:59
12:41:04
12:41:08
12:41:11
12:41:14
12:41:19
12:41:23
12:41:28
12:41:33
12:41:34
12:41:39
12:41:43
12:41:48
12:41:52
12:41:52
12:41:55
12:42:00
12:42:01
12:42:04
12:42:08
12:42:10
12:42:11
12:42:16
12:42:19
138 only smoked Lucky Strike for about a year.
I believe that that's the best and the most
supported view of the evidence.
Or you can accept Mr. Kerrivan's trial testimony,
only his trial testimony, in which case the Reynolds
cigarettes still don't substantially contribute. According
to Mr. Kerrivan's own treating doctor, Dr. Shah, he didn't
smoke enough Reynolds cigarettes to contribute to his COPD.
And you also heard that he would have gotten COPD
even if he never smoked Reynolds cigarettes.
Or perhaps you think Mr. Kerrivan was just
confused, that he can't remember how long he smoked Camel.
And while it may be difficult for Mr. Kerrivan to remember
something from a long, long time ago or, really, for any of
us to remember something from a long, long time ago, we are
in a courtroom; and Mr. Kerrivan is suing to recover money.
And you've heard Judge Erickson say it. We've all said it
here. Mr. Kerrivan has the burden of proof. And hazy
memories are not enough. Only proof is.
So however you choose to view the conflicting
testimony that you heard in this courtroom from Mr. Kerrivan,
I just don't think it has been proven that he smoked any
significant amount of Reynolds brands.
Mr. Kerrivan only smoked a small amount of my
client's brands, and he hasn't met this burden. So any way
12:42:24
12:42:27
12:42:30
12:42:31
12:42:35
12:42:39
12:42:42
12:42:46
12:42:52
12:42:55
12:42:58
12:43:04
12:43:08
12:43:10
12:43:15
12:43:20
12:43:23
12:43:26
12:43:30
12:43:32
12:43:36
12:43:40
12:43:44
12:43:46
12:43:50
139 you slice it, the Reynolds smoking was a very, very small
part of the total smoking.
Now, why is this so important? Why are we talking
about this? It's because of something called legal cause.
Now, as Judge Erickson has already told you, one of
the issues that you're going to have to decide in this case
is whether plaintiff proved to you that smoking Reynolds
cigarettes was a legal cause of Mr. Kerrivan's COPD. And in
Judge Erickson's instructions, he's told you what legal cause
is. It isn't a plain cause like you and I might use the
word. It's a word that has special legal significance.
There's a legal definition.
Do we have that up on the screen? Thank you.
I'm not going to reread this because you've heard a
lot about this instruction here today, but I have highlighted
a few things that I want to talk with you about as we move
forward.
So, first, let me show you where this fits in on
the Verdict Form.
This will be question three. And again, I'm not
going to go over the things that Mr. Davis has already talked
with you about. For the reasons that he's already told you,
we don't think that you should even get to this question,
that you should answer "no" to the first two questions. But
if you get here, this is where you'll need to decide whether
12:43:57
12:43:59
12:44:00
12:44:03
12:44:07
12:44:09
12:44:11
12:44:15
12:44:21
12:44:23
12:44:28
12:44:32
12:44:40
12:44:43
12:44:45
12:44:48
12:44:50
12:44:52
12:44:54
12:44:55
12:44:59
12:45:01
12:45:04
12:45:07
12:45:10
140 cigarettes smoked by Mr. Kerrivan made by my client was a
legal cause of Mr. Kerrivan's COPD.
And as you know, plaintiff has the burden of proof.
He has the burden to prove that Reynolds cigarettes legally
caused or substantially contributed to Mr. Kerrivan's COPD.
Plaintiff did not meet that burden. He did not
prove his case against Reynolds. And that means that you
check "no" to Reynolds on question three, and you do not
answer any more questions on the Verdict Form as to Reynolds.
So there are two things that I would ask you to
think about when you're looking at this question. And the
first thing is the limited amount of Reynolds cigarettes that
Mr. Kerrivan smoked, and that's what I just went over with
you.
But I'd also like you to think about substantial
contribution in terms of pack years. And you've all heard
about the concept of pack years several times throughout this
trial, and it's the amount of cigarettes that a person smokes
multiplied by the number of years that they smoked.
And in filling out this Verdict Form, you should
know how many packs of Reynolds brands Mr. Kerrivan smoked
compared to the rest of his smoking.
So you heard from Dr. Grunberg and Dr. Shah, and
they told you that Mr. Kerrivan had 150 pack years total.
You also heard from Dr. Gravelyn, and he said he
12:45:14
12:45:18
12:45:21
12:45:25
12:45:28
12:45:33
12:45:36
12:45:39
12:45:43
12:45:46
12:45:49
12:45:53
12:45:56
12:45:58
12:45:59
12:46:02
12:46:07
12:46:10
12:46:14
12:46:18
12:46:21
12:46:25
12:46:27
12:46:30
12:46:36
141 wasn't quite sure, but it was more than 100 pack years. So
we're talking about a lot of pack years here, and that's of
all the of the brands that Mr. Kerrivan smoked. It's all of
his smoking combined.
But how much of that is Reynolds? Depending on
which version of the story that you believe from
Mr. Kerrivan, he smoked one, maybe up to four packs of -- or
four years of Lucky Strike.
And when he was smoking Lucky Strike, he was
smoking less than a pack a day. That's where you heard about
he was only smoking about five cigarettes a day, and maybe at
some point he got up to a half a pack, and then he said maybe
he got up to one pack.
So if you fully accept Mr. Kerrivan's trial
testimony only, then maybe you get four pack years from the
Lucky Strike.
But I respectfully suggest that the evidence shows
that there was no more than one pack year total of the
Reynolds brands.
Now, even if you were to accept that Mr. Kerrivan
smoked ten years of Camel at one pack a day, that's still
just ten pack years. And keep in mind, that is only if you
accept everything that plaintiff said here at trial and that
you completely disregard the earlier four statements under
oath that he told you about Camel.
12:46:39
12:46:42
12:46:46
12:46:49
12:46:50
12:46:54
12:46:59
12:47:05
12:47:07
12:47:09
12:47:12
12:47:16
12:47:20
12:47:22
12:47:26
12:47:30
12:47:32
12:47:35
12:47:39
12:47:40
12:47:43
12:47:46
12:47:51
12:47:54
12:47:58
142 So whether you believe Mr. Kerrivan smoked one pack
year or 11 pack years or 14 pack years of Reynolds smoking,
out of the 150 years total, the Reynolds smoking is just not
substantial.
Now, the second thing I'd ask you to think about
when looking at this question is Dr. Shah's testimony, and
you only needed to hear from Dr. Shah on this. This was
Mr. Kerrivan's own doctor.
And he told you that there's a certain threshold
that is required before someone develops COPD. And he told
you that that threshold was 20 pack years.
And I believe that the best and the most supported
view of the evidence is that Mr. Kerrivan only smoked one
pack year of Reynolds, and that's it. But if you only accept
Mr. Kerrivan's trial testimony, he had, at the very, very
most, a 14 pack year history of Reynolds, and that's it.
That does not meet the burden. That does not meet the
threshold that Dr. Shah told you was required, his own
doctor.
Now, Judge Erickson has talked to us about common
sense. We talked about it during jury selection. And he
told us that common sense is important and that you should
filter all the evidence using your common sense.
You shouldn't check it at the door.
The evidence showed that Mr. Kerrivan's Reynolds
12:48:01
12:48:05
12:48:10
12:48:16
12:48:16
12:48:19
12:48:23
12:48:28
12:48:29
12:48:33
12:48:37
12:48:40
12:48:43
12:48:46
12:48:52
12:48:55
12:49:00
12:49:04
12:49:07
12:49:07
12:49:11
12:49:14
12:49:17
12:49:20
12:49:22
143 smoking was a very small part of his 150 pack years of
smoking.
Now, you also heard that Mr. Kerrivan's other 100
plus pack years that he smoked were more than enough to cause
his COPD. And that's regardless of whether he smoked any
Reynolds product.
So let me show you where that fits in with Judge
Erickson's instructions. So we're going back to the legal
cause instruction that we've talked so much about, and the
key words here are going to be "but for."
So what that means is, would Mr. Kerrivan have
still developed COPD even if he never smoked a Reynolds
product? So let's see if it fits.
You heard the evidence. You heard that the other
100 plus pack years of smoking non-Reynolds products is more
than enough to cause the COPD.
In fact, you heard from Dr. Shah that you are at a
significantly increased risk once you reach even 40 pack
years.
So there's no question that Reynolds smoking was
not a "but for" cause. He would have developed COPD anyway,
based on his other smoking.
Now, I'd also like to briefly address what
plaintiff's medical expert, Dr. Gravelyn, said. And I stood
here during opening statements, and I asked you to focus on
12:49:25
12:49:29
12:49:31
12:49:35
12:49:39
12:49:42
12:49:43
12:49:47
12:49:50
12:49:53
12:49:55
12:49:59
12:50:03
12:50:05
12:50:09
12:50:15
12:50:17
12:50:24
12:50:26
12:50:27
12:50:29
12:50:33
12:50:35
12:50:39
12:50:45
144 the term "substantial." So I don't think it's any surprise
to anyone here that I'm talking to you right now about
substantial contribution.
So when we moved through trial and we were talking
with Dr. Gravelyn, he was asked if all of the cigarettes
contributed to Mr. Kerrivan's COPD. And use your -- use your
own recollection of what you heard about the testimony and
what you heard in the evidence, but I'd respectfully suggest
that he was not asked whether the Reynolds cigarettes --
whether all cigarettes substantially contributed. He was
simply asked were all the cigarettes -- did they all
contribute?
And contribute is not the legal standard. The
legal standard is substantially contribute.
If there was any evidence that smoking Reynolds
products substantially contributed to Mr. Kerrivan's COPD,
you would have heard it from plaintiff's own expert, but you
didn't hear it from Dr. Gravelyn. Plaintiff did not meet his
burden of proof on this issue.
Now, you also heard a lot about addiction and being
part of a continuous chain, but that's not true for Reynolds.
Mr. Kerrivan was not destined to get COPD after he
just smoked his first cigarette. That is not a direct or
continuous chain.
Reynolds cigarettes did not directly and in natural
12:50:49
12:50:51
12:50:55
12:50:57
12:51:02
12:51:07
12:51:13
12:51:16
12:51:20
12:51:25
12:51:28
12:51:33
12:51:34
12:51:37
12:51:40
12:51:43
12:51:48
12:51:51
12:51:54
12:51:56
12:52:01
12:52:08
12:52:12
12:52:16
12:52:17
145 and continuous sequence cause Mr. Kerrivan's COPD because
Mr. Kerrivan could have quit smoking, and we know that he
could have quit because he did.
Had Mr. Kerrivan stopped smoking altogether when he
stopped smoking Reynolds cigarettes, he would have not
developed COPD; but he didn't even try, and he didn't even
try for many years after he stopped smoking Reynolds
cigarettes.
Mr. Kerrivan made the choice to quit smoking cold
turkey in 2006, and he hasn't touched a cigarette since.
It was Mr. Kerrivan's choice to start smoking, and
it was Mr. Kerrivan's choice not to try to quit earlier, and
it was Mr. Kerrivan's choice to finally quit when he did,
successfully, in 2006, and it was Mr. Kerrivan's choice to
never pick up a cigarette again.
And why does this matter to Reynolds? You heard
evidence that if Mr. Kerrivan would have quit smoking by the
age of 40, and that would have been in 1982, or at some point
before he reached a 40 pack year history, he would have never
developed COPD.
So no matter which version of events
Mr. Kerrivan -- of Mr. Kerrivan's that you believe, if he
would have stopped smoking Reynolds cigarettes by this time,
he wouldn't have developed it.
And the evidence showed that Mr. Kerrivan stopped
12:52:21
12:52:26
12:52:29
12:52:30
12:52:36
12:52:42
12:52:44
12:52:47
12:52:47
12:52:49
12:52:53
12:52:57
12:53:01
12:53:04
12:53:09
12:53:11
12:53:14
12:53:18
12:53:22
12:53:26
12:53:27
12:53:31
12:53:33
12:53:39
12:53:40
146 smoking Reynolds cigarettes well before he was 40, in 1982.
And the evidence showed that Mr. Kerrivan stopped smoking
Reynolds cigarettes well before he ever reached a 40 pack
year history.
So that means that if Mr. Kerrivan had quit smoking
altogether when he quit smoking the Reynolds cigarettes, he
would have never developed COPD, and we wouldn't be here
today.
Reynolds cannot be a "but for" cause of Mr.
Kerrivan's COPD because he would not have developed the COPD
if he had stopped smoking altogether when he stopped smoking
those Reynolds cigarettes.
Now, I don't think you should get any further on
the Verdict Form than this question three for Reynolds, but
it's my job to talk to you about the rest of the Verdict
Form. So I'm going to do that briefly.
For all the reasons that you heard about Mr.
Kerrivan's choices and the messages that he received
throughout his lifetime about the dangers of smoking,
Reynolds should have zero responsibility. But the evidence
also shows that Reynolds should have zero responsibility for
an additional reason, and that additional reason is the one
that I've been talking with you-all about this afternoon, and
it's the limited amount of smoking Reynolds cigarettes.
Now, I'd like to take a look quickly at question
12:53:43
12:53:47
12:53:51
12:53:53
12:53:54
12:53:58
12:54:03
12:54:06
12:54:06
12:54:10
12:54:12
12:54:16
12:54:18
12:54:21
12:54:24
12:54:27
12:54:29
12:54:32
12:54:35
12:54:38
12:54:42
12:54:45
12:54:50
12:54:52
12:54:55
147 four and question six on the Verdict Form. Again, I don't
think that you should get here; but if you do, I would ask
that you focus on one word in these questions, and that word
is "relied."
Now, plaintiff's experts testified for almost five
full days, and they showed you advertisements, and they
showed you documents from tobacco companies, and they showed
you a lot of other irrelevant information to Reynolds, things
about filters and lights and ultra lights. And they all have
nothing to do with the Reynolds cigarettes that Mr. Kerrivan
smoked.
Mr. Kerrivan never smoked a filtered cigarette made
by Reynolds, and Mr. Kerrivan never smoked a light cigarette
made by Reynolds, and Mr. Kerrivan never smoked an ultra
light cigarette made by Reynolds.
You heard no testimony, none, that Mr. Kerrivan
ever relied on anything that Reynolds said.
Instead, what you heard was that Mr. Kerrivan
thought that taste was important when he was deciding
whether -- what to smoke. If he didn't like the taste, he
didn't smoke the brand.
You heard that he saw that Kool ad. But he did not
like the taste of Kool. He said it's terrible. And he threw
that pack away, and he never smoked it again. So whatever
that ad was, he wasn't relying on it.
12:54:58
12:55:02
12:55:05
12:55:08
12:55:09
12:55:13
12:55:17
12:55:21
12:55:26
12:55:28
12:55:31
12:55:31
12:55:35
12:55:38
12:55:42
12:55:43
12:55:48
12:55:51
12:55:55
12:55:58
12:56:02
12:56:03
12:56:08
12:56:12
12:56:15
148 Whatever that ad was, he was relying on his taste,
and he was relying on his personal experience smoking the
brand.
So these two questions on the Verdict Form come
down to one thing, and it's did Mr. Kerrivan rely on
something Reynolds did or didn't do?
And you heard no evidence that Mr. Kerrivan relied.
Plaintiff did not meet his burden.
Now, Mr. Byrd has suggested to you-all an enormous
amount of money against Reynolds despite the fact that
Mr. Kerrivan only smoked Reynolds cigarettes for a brief
amount of time.
So I'd ask you to think about the common sense
instruction that the judge has talked with you about when we
first got here during jury selection. You should not award
Mr. Kerrivan any money from Reynolds for the limited amount
of time that he was smoking Reynolds cigarettes that he
smoked nearly six decades ago. That means checking "no" to
Reynolds on question three.
The Reynolds cigarettes did not substantially
contribute to Mr. Kerrivan's COPD. And the Reynolds
cigarettes did not directly and in natural and continuous
sequence cause Mr. Kerrivan's COPD.
If Mr. Kerrivan had chosen to quit smoking
altogether when he stopped smoking Reynolds cigarettes, he
12:56:17
12:56:20
12:56:23
12:56:23
12:56:27
12:56:31
12:56:33
12:56:37
12:56:39
12:56:45
12:56:49
12:56:52
12:56:53
12:56:56
12:56:59
12:57:03
12:57:05
12:57:09
12:57:13
12:57:15
12:57:19
12:57:23
12:57:28
12:57:29
12:57:32
149 would have never gotten COPD.
So for all of these reasons that I've talked with
you about and all of the reasons that Mr. Davis talked with
you about, I'm asking you to return a defense verdict in
favor of Reynolds.
Thank you again for your attention and for your
service.
the Court.
