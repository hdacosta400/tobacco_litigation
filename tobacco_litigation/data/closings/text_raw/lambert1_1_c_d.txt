15           MS. LUTHER:  Thank you, Judge.
16           Good afternoon, everyone.
17           May it please the Court.
18           This case isn't about all smokers.  It's not
19       about the general public.  It's not about
20       whether you believe people should smoke
21       cigarettes or not.  And it's not about whether
22       you believe there are cigarette smokers out
23       there who are influenced by things that you saw
24       or heard in this trial.  This case is about one,
25       and only one, cigarette smoker, Jayme 4001
1       Westmoreland.
2           When we started this trial almost three
3       weeks ago, I told you that there would be a main
4       story to this case and a side story.  The main
5       story, of course, is Ms. Westmoreland, the
6       decisions and choices she made about smoking,
7       why she started, why she continued to smoke for
8       over 20 years, when did she learn about the
9       health risks of smoking, her ability to quit
10       smoking and ultimately her decision to finally
11       stop.
12           The side story and the story that plaintiff
13       wants you to focus on is the conduct of Liggett
14       as a manufacturer of Lark cigarettes, Liggett's
15       role and the roles of other tobacco companies in
16       the industry, Liggett's role in the scientific
17       issues concerning smoking and health, Liggett's
18       research efforts, and ultimately, what impact
19       did Liggett's statements or actions have on
20       Ms. Westmoreland and the decisions she made
21       about smoking.
22           I'm going to do my best this afternoon to
23       try and tie the evidence that we've seen to talk
24       about what we learned during the case and how we
25       see the facts and then talk about some of 4002
1       instructions Judge Day gave you and the
2       questions that you're going to be asked on the
3       verdict form.
4           Now, let me say something about the findings
5       from the earlier Engle case you heard about.
6       There's no debate about this.  Those findings do
7       not establish that Liggett is liable, meaning
8       legally responsible to the plaintiff in this
9       case.
10           You now know, because Judge Day instructed
11       you, that you get to decide by your verdict in
12       this case whether those findings have any
13       applicability to Ms. Westmoreland, whether those
14       findings have any context in the story that
15       you've now heard about her and how she lived her
16       life.  After all, this case is about
17       Ms. Westmoreland.
18           Her daughter filed this lawsuit and now is
19       asking you to award her and her brother up to
20       $20 million for their mother's decisions to
21       smoke cigarettes for more than 20 years.  And
22       you are the only people who have heard
23       Ms. Westmoreland's story.  The Engle jury didn't
24       hear a thing about Ms. Westmoreland.
25           So what is Ms. Westmoreland's story?  She 4003
1       smoked for reasons known only to herself.  She
2       was aware from the first time she picked up a
3       cigarette at her aunt's house that smoking was
4       dangerous.
5           She demonstrated the ability to quit, if
6       that was what she wanted to do.
7           There's nothing that Liggett did that made
8       Ms. Westmoreland start smoking or kept her from
9       quitting for all those years, and there's
10       nothing that Liggett, or anyone else, for that
11       matter, could have done or said that would have
12       made Ms. Westmoreland choose to stop smoking any
13       sooner than she did.
14           Ms. Westmoreland didn't follow the urgings
15       of her father and her brother not to start
16       smoking or later to quit, and she didn't heed
17       the warnings that went on every single pack of
18       cigarettes she smoked starting in 1966, shortly
19       after she first experimented with her first
20       cigarette.
21           Notwithstanding the extensive information
22       available to her throughout the entire time that
23       she smoked regarding the health risks of smoking
24       and the benefits of quitting, Ms. Westmoreland
25       chose on her own terms to smoke, just like she 4004
1       did everything else in her life.
2           Given that backdrop, should Liggett be held
3       responsible for Ms. Westmoreland's death?
4       Should Liggett be required to pay money to
5       Ms. Lambert and Mr. Westmoreland for their
6       mother's lifestyle choices over the decades that
7       she smoked?
8           I told you in jury selection that it is
9       Liggett's position that Ms. Westmoreland was 100
10       percent responsible for the choices she made and
11       her ultimate illness.  That hasn't changed.
12           We also discussed during jury selection and
13       I mentioned again in my opening, this is a very
14       sad case.  It would be impossible not to feel
15       sympathy for Mrs. Lambert and Mr. Westmoreland.
16       It's never easy to lose a parent, and it's
17       especially difficult to do so under these
18       circumstances.  But that doesn't mean that
19       Liggett is responsible for Ms. Westmoreland's
20       injuries or that Liggett should be required to
21       compensate Mrs. Lambert and Mr. Westmoreland for
22       that loss.
23           Now I want to highlight a couple of the
24       instructions that Judge Day gave you.  And I'm
25       not very good with the ELMO, so let's see how I 4005
1       can manage this.
2           So, "You may use reason and common sense to
3       reach conclusions."
4           Can you all see that?  I know I'm kind of
5       blocking.  Okay.  Let's see.  Okay.
6           "You may use reason and common sense to
7       reach conclusions.  You may draw reasonable
8       inferences from the evidence.  And in evaluating
9       the believability of the witnesses and what
10       weight to give the testimony of any particular
11       witness, you may properly consider the demeanor
12       of the witness while testifying, the frankness
13       or lack of frankness of the witness, the
14       intelligence of the witness, any interest the
15       witness may have in the outcome of the case, the
16       means and opportunity the witness had to know
17       the facts about which the witness testified, the
18       ability of the witness to remember matters about
19       which the witness testified, and the
20       reasonableness of the testimony of the witness
21       considered in light of all the evidence in the
22       case and in light of your own experience and
23       common sense."
24           Reason and common sense.  You all did not
25       leave that behind you when this trial started. 4006
1       We ask that you rely on that when you evaluate
2       the testimony of the various witnesses who
3       testified in this case.
4           With that in mind, what did the evidence
5       show?  What kind of person was Jayme
6       Westmoreland?  Everyone who came into this
7       courtroom, either live or by deposition
8       testimony, who knew Ms. Westmoreland described
9       her the same way.
10           Mrs. Lambert said her mother was
11       intelligent, disciplined.  She was both smart
12       and had street smarts and she took
13       responsibility for her actions.
14       Mr. Westmoreland said his mother was a strong
15       person.  She was strong-willed.  She was
16       intelligent.  She had common sense.  And if she
17       set her mind to accomplishing something, she did
18       it.
19           Roxan, her sister, said that she was smart
20       and also said that she had street smarts.  She
21       was intelligent.  And, importantly, Roxan told
22       us that Ms. Westmoreland wasn't gullible.  And
23       on two occasions she volunteered that Ms.
24       Westmoreland essentially did what she wanted.
25           This was a series of questions that was 4007
1       asked during trial.
2           "Identified a problem for herself.
3           "Yes.
4           "And set about resolving that problem for
5       herself.
6           "Yes, she did.
7           "She didn't need any help from anybody to do
8       that, did she?
9           "No, she did what she wanted."
10           MS. LUTHER:  Am I in your way, Ms. Bjostad?
11           JUROR BJOSTAD:  No.
12           "Did you ever have a conversation with Jayme
13       about the warnings on the cigarette packs?
14           "No.  She would do what she wanted to do."
15           That's what Roxan said about her sister.
16           Wayne Westmoreland, her brother,
17       corroborated all of this.
18           I thought it was interesting that the
19       plaintiff didn't call Wayne Westmoreland to
20       testify on their side of the case.  I mean, in
21       all of this he was the person who was closest to
22       Ms. Westmoreland when she started smoking.  So
23       we brought his testimony so you would get the
24       full picture.
25           And he said his sister was intelligent and 4008
1       had common sense and if she made her mind up to
2       do something, she did it.  And in case you
3       weren't already getting this picture, he told us
4       that she wasn't easily led.  Like Roxan said,
5       she would do what she wanted to do.
6           Even Dr. Pell, one of the treating
7       physicians who came here to testify live, agreed
8       that she was intelligent.  And he didn't agree
9       with much of anything that we asked him.
10           The bottom line of all of this was that
11       Ms. Westmoreland was no one's dupe.
12           So what have we learned from the witnesses
13       about when Ms. Westmoreland started smoking and
14       why?  You might remember the timeline that I had
15       put up during my opening.  So right about here,
16       in 1965, Ms. Westmoreland smokes her first
17       cigarette.  Ms. Westmoreland was with her
18       brother, Wayne, when she had her first cigarette
19       when she was 14 or 15 years old.  And remember,
20       you were told she was born in 1951.
21           What happened when she stole that Parliament
22       cigarette from her aunt, lit up, breathed
23       cigarette smoke into her lungs for the first
24       time?  She coughed.  And her brother laughed at
25       her, and he asked her if she was sure she wanted 4009
1       to do that.  She coughed.  She only took three
2       hits off the cigarette and she put it out.  And
3       he didn't see her smoke again until she was 17
4       years old, which was consistent with what Roxan
5       also said.  And she was around Roxan all the
6       time because she was her surrogate mother.
7           The first time Roxan saw Ms. Westmoreland
8       smoke was when Roxan was about seven or eight
9       years old, which would have made
10       Ms. Westmoreland about 17 or 18 years old
11       because there was a ten year difference between
12       the two of them.  This was around the time
13       Ms. Westmoreland was a senior in high school, so
14       we're talking about 1968 or 1969.
15           Even the medical records, based on
16       information Ms. Westmoreland personally provided
17       to her treating physicians, corroborate that she
18       started smoking regularly in the 1970s when she
19       was in her 20s.
20           Here is a compilation of the medical records
21       that are going to go back to the jury room with
22       you.  She stated she had smoked a pack and
23       one -- a pack and a half a day for 21 years.
24       This is what she told Dr. Pell on November 25th.
25       And she smokes one to two packages daily and has 4010
1       done so for the past 20 years, November 26,
2       1993.
3           And we know that her first regular brand was
4       Parliament.  That was the brand she stole from
5       her aunt, and that's the brand she continued to
6       smoke until sometime shortly before she moved to
7       South Carolina when she was about 18 years old.
8       Parliament is not a Liggett brand.
9           Plaintiff makes a big deal about the fact
10       that her brother only actually witnessed her
11       with 40 total Parliament cigarettes.  They
12       emphasized that in Wayne Westmoreland's
13       testimony.  But Wayne was very clear that this
14       was her first regular brand.  This is what he
15       said about this.
16           "When she was smoking at age 17, what brand
17       was she smoking?
18           "It wasn't Lark.  It was something else.  I
19       think she was smoking Parliament back then.
20           "And do you recall how many occasions you
21       saw her smoke Parliament back then?
22           "When I saw her smoke whatever, it was
23       Parliament."
24           And then one more segment, which we may or
25       may not have.  We do.  Great. 4011
1           "And during the time until she went away to
2       South Carolina, what brands of cigarettes?
3           "The one I recall most from that period of
4       time would have been Parliament."
5           Wayne was also very clear that when she
6       moved to South Carolina she was smoking less
7       than he was at the time, and he was smoking
8       about a half a pack a day.  So by 1969 or so
9       she's only smoking about a half a pack a day.
10           Plaintiff claims that Liggett concealed
11       material information from Ms. Westmoreland, and
12       if she had the information that was supposedly
13       concealed, she would have been able to avoid her
14       lung cancer.  That is just not credible.
15           We have a wealth of information available to
16       us that demonstrates the falsity of this claim.
17       The timeline sets out all the relevant dates.
18       We've got the 1964 Surgeon General's Report
19       before she even smokes her first cigarette.  We
20       have a caution label on packs in '66.  And at
21       this point in time she isn't even a regular
22       smoker.
23           In the early 1950s emerging scientific
24       information linking cigarette use with lung
25       cancer was so well-publicized that it started a 4012
1       cancer scare.  You saw the graph that Mr.
2       Gustafson put up earlier this morning and the
3       decline.  It's not a big decline on the graph,
4       but it was a decline.  There was a precipitous
5       decline of people who were smoking in the 1950s
6       because of the mouse skin-painting studies and
7       the other studies that were coming out linking
8       the tar and cigarette smoke to cancer.
9           In the mid 1950s with the publication of the
10       Wynder and Graham mouse skin-painting study,
11       cigarette use declined in the United States.
12       And throughout the 1950s and '60s, as more
13       scientific evidence emerged showing the
14       relationship between lung cancer and cigarettes,
15       there was more information that was publicized
16       by newspapers, magazines, television news and
17       the like.
18           You know, by 1963 the information regarding
19       lung cancer and cigarettes was so widely known
20       that it was a common association in popular
21       movies and television programs.  And you may
22       remember this clip.
23     (Video clip was played and taken down to the best
24 of the reporter's ability as follows:)
25           PAUL NEWMAN:  You know, I'm going out pretty 4013
1       soon and my credit is kind of shaky.
2           GERALDINE PAGE:  I would like to smoke,
3       please.  No, no.  Just one of the ordinary
4       cigarettes that only give you cancer.
5     (Video clip concluded.)
6           MS. LUTHER:  Just one of the ordinary
7       cigarettes.  They only give you cancer.
8           The story culminated with the publication of
9       the 1964 Surgeon General's Report, which we've
10       talked a lot about in this case.  This is one of
11       the most important news stories of the 20th
12       century.  Mrs. Westmoreland started smoking
13       after that report came out.  News that the
14       Surgeon General had concluded that smoking
15       caused lung cancer in men was everywhere you
16       turned back then.
17           She watched the television news every night.
18       As Wayne testified, their father told them to
19       shut up and learn something when the news was
20       on.  And the 1964 Surgeon General's Report was
21       news everywhere, on television and in the
22       newspapers.
23           You saw examples of that coverage when
24       Dr. DiBacco was on the stand.  And Wayne
25       Westmoreland confirmed that coverage of the 1964 4014
1       Surgeon General's Report was everywhere where
2       they lived, even in Red Bank, New Jersey.
3           If there was any question regarding the
4       impact of the 1964 Surgeon General's Report, all
5       you had to do was look at what was happening to
6       the rates of cigarette smoking in the four years
7       after it came out.
8           Smoking rates started to decline
9       precipitously, even before the Surgeon General's
10       report came out in '64.  When huge numbers of
11       smokers across the United States were quitting
12       smoking cold turkey, Jayme Westmoreland made a
13       different choice.  She started smoking and
14       became a regular smoker.
15           Professor DiBacco explained in 1964
16       information regarding health and cancer risks of
17       cigarettes was flooding the public through
18       newspapers, magazines and news stories.  In that
19       year the American Medical Association stated
20       that the health hazards of excessive smoking
21       have been well-publicized for more than ten
22       years and are common knowledge.
23           And I know Mr. Gustafson took a shot at the
24       AMA because they were receiving money from the
25       tobacco companies for doing research into 4015
1       issues of smoking and health, but would they
2       have been able to get away with a statement like
3       that?  Do you think they really would have been
4       able to surmount scrutiny for a statement like
5       that if it weren't accurate?
6           By 1964 Professor DiBacco explained that the
7       not-proven statements by The Tobacco Institute
8       and other industry representatives weren't given
9       much credibility or even prominence in the
10       public press.  Nobody got their health
11       information from tobacco representatives or paid
12       cigarette advertisements.
13           By the late 1960s the American Cancer
14       Society and other not-for-profit groups
15       published public service announcements spreading
16       the message about health risks and lung cancer
17       risks of smoking cigarettes.  And we showed you
18       some of those.  This is just one to remind you
19       of what some of those messages were.

21 of the reporter's ability as follows:)
22           VOICE:  You lose.
23     (Video clip concluded.)
24           MS. LUTHER:  The message of this public
25       service announcement is pretty clear.  You buy a 4016
1       pack of cigarettes, you're gambling with your
2       life.  This was 1969, when Jayme Westmoreland
3       was 18 years old, around the time that she
4       became a regular smoker.
5           By the early 1970s the Federal Trade
6       Commission was monitoring and regulating
7       cigarette advertising.  And every cigarette ad
8       and every cigarette pack was required to include
9       its tar and nicotine values as measured by the
10       FTC method.
11           By 1972 cigarette companies were no longer
12       permitted to advertise on television or radio.
13       The Surgeon General's 1964 was one of the top
14       stories of the 20th century.  And she started
15       smoking after that report came out.
16           When huge numbers of smokers continued to
17       quit, Jayme Westmoreland continued to smoke.
18       And throughout the years that she continued to
19       smoke, the rates of smoking in the United States
20       continued to drop.  More than half of ever
21       smokers have quit.  More people have quit
22       smoking than not.  And around the time that she
23       started smoking, the debate was raging about
24       putting warnings on the packs.  And they
25       actually went on the packs years before she was 4017
1       a regular smoker.
2           And before I go any further, I want to make
3       it clear, Liggett is not criticizing Jayme
4       Westmoreland for her decision to smoke.  It's
5       something that we are -- we live in America.  We
6       live in the United States.  These are decisions
7       that we're all entitled to make.  And she made a
8       decision, and she smoked.  And now her children
9       are trying to get money for it.  But Liggett is
10       not criticizing Jayme Westmoreland for her
11       decision to smoke cigarettes.
12           Now, she saw the warnings on the packs
13       starting in 1966.  And this is what the first
14       warning said:  "CAUTION:  Cigarette Smoking May
15       Be Hazardous To Your Health."  And this warning
16       was a warning that was required by Congress,
17       written by Congress.  And it ran from January 1,
18       1966 through October 31st, 1970.
19           Then in 1969, around the time that she
20       became a regular smoker, the warnings changed
21       again.  And every time she picked up a pack of
22       cigarettes, it said, "WARNING:  The Surgeon
23       General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is
24       Dangerous To Your Health."
25           Again, this is language, verbiage that 4018
1       Congress dictated we were required to put on the
2       packs.  It wasn't information that the companies
3       put on voluntarily.  There were congressional
4       hearings and they talked about the content of
5       the warnings.  And this is what Congress decided
6       that the companies were going to put on the
7       packs.
8           The reason it said this as opposed to
9       smoking causes lung cancer, I suspect, is
10       because at the time there was information that
11       smoking impacted other aspects of people's
12       health, so rather than limit it to lung cancer,
13       they wanted to get the broader message out that
14       it caused health hazards.
15           Her father told her she shouldn't smoke
16       because it was bad for her health.
17           And with all of this personal information
18       available to her, she clearly knew that smoking
19       carried real health risks.
20           Ms. Westmoreland knew that smoking came with
21       health risks in the 1960s, and she started
22       smoking and continued smoking and never tried to
23       quit once in the 1960s.  And she knew that
24       smoking came with health risks in the 1970s.
25       And she continued smoking and never tried to 4019
1       quit in the 1970s.  And she started -- she
2       continued smoking in the 1980s.  And the
3       evidence is that it wasn't until at least the
4       mid 1980s that she tried to quit for the very
5       first time.
6           She didn't have to start smoking and she
7       could have chosen to stop smoking at any point
8       in time before she finally stopped in 1993,
9       months before she was diagnosed with lung
10       cancer.
11           Plaintiff would have you believe that she
12       couldn't stop smoking because of an addiction to
13       nicotine.
14           So what do we know about nicotine?  We know
15       that it occurs naturally in tobacco.  And we
16       know that nicotine is out of the bloodstream of
17       a smoker within 12 to 48 hours of smoking
18       cessation.  We know that its existence was not a
19       secret nor was it a secret that nicotine was the
20       reason why people smoke.
21           It's not information that the tobacco
22       companies were hiding from the world.  And it
23       certainly wasn't information that Liggett was
24       hiding from the public health community.
25           Liggett actually told the Surgeon General in 4020
1       its 1963 submission to the Surgeon General's
2       committee, which I'll discuss in more detail in
3       a bit, that nicotine had physiological effects
4       and that people didn't smoke other things
5       because they didn't have nicotine in them.
6           In volume four of the submission, and I have
7       some excerpts from the submission which is in
8       evidence as Defendant's Exhibit 42, this is what
9       Liggett told the Surgeon General about
10       nicotine's effect on the smoker.
11           "The highly active pharmacologic agent
12       characteristically in tobacco and its smoke, the
13       pleasurable effects of low doses of this
14       alkaloid, as well as tobacco aroma and flavor
15       characteristics presumably are the reasons why
16       people smoke tobacco instead of some other
17       material."
18           And they go on to say, "It's been found to
19       be one of the most potent central nervous system
20       arousal agents known."
21           That sounds like a lot like what Dr. Hurt
22       and Dr. Brady were telling you in this
23       courtroom.  Liggett wasn't hiding the ball.
24       That's in the 1963 submission to the Surgeon
25       General's committee. 4021
1           Even though the Surgeon General in 1964
2       declined to call nicotine addictive, he did say
3       it was habituating, meaning it was
4       habit-forming.  This was information that was
5       available to everybody.  And he was very careful
6       to point out that just because he was calling it
7       habituating doesn't mean it's easy to quit.
8           Here are a couple of excerpts from the 1964
9       Surgeon General's Report that say just that.
10       "The tobacco habit should be characterized as a
11       habituation rather than an addiction.
12       Discontinuation of smoking, although possessing
13       the difficulties attendant upon distinction of
14       any conditioned reflex, the behavioral aspects
15       of smoking is accomplished best by reinforcing
16       factors."
17           Then is that 351?  Do you also have -- was
18       it 34, Josh?
19           "Thus, correctly designating the chronic use
20       of tobacco as habituation rather than addiction
21       carries with it no implication that the habit
22       may be broken easily."
23           They knew this.  This was not something that
24       was being hidden by the tobacco companies.
25           Professor DiBacco -- actually, let me back 4022
1       up.
2           Dr. Brady told us that even today, 50 years
3       later, we are learning how nicotine impacts the
4       question of addiction.  But regardless of that
5       fact, it had been known for a very long time
6       when Jayme Westmoreland started smoking in the
7       1960s that once you start it can be difficult to
8       stop.  Dr. Brady confirmed that, and Dr. DiBacco
9       showed you that.  And you just saw that Liggett
10       told the Surgeon General in 1963 what it knew
11       about the subject.  It wasn't hiding the ball.
12           Professor DiBacco testified that the
13       addiction risks of cigarettes were well-known in
14       the United States before 1950 and even before
15       Ms. Westmoreland was born.  By the 1930s and
16       '40s terms such as "nicotine addict" and
17       "nicotine fiend" were understood and accepted in
18       popular culture, so much so that we saw an
19       example of the term "nicotine addict" in the
20       1942 Alfred Hitchcock film Saboteur.
21     (Video clip was played and taken down to the best
22 of the reporter's ability as follows:)
23           VOICE:  Hey, buddy, hold the wheel a while,
24       will you, while I elevate this thing.  I'm a
25       nicotine addict. 4023
1     (Video clip concluded.)
2           MS. LUTHER:  Professor DiBacco also
3       illustrated the extent to which the addiction
4       risks of cigarettes were understood by showing
5       the elementary textbooks from the 1930s were
6       required to teach children that cigarettes pose
7       significant health risks, including that
8       nicotine is habit-forming and makes people want
9       to smoke all the time.
10           This is an excerpt from one of those
11       textbooks.  "Tobacco does no one any good.  It
12       does some people a great deal of harm."
13       Scrolling down to the bottom.  "The tobacco
14       habit grows on most people.  That is, it gets
15       worse.  They smoke more and more until they are
16       smoking nearly all the time.  Bad habits are
17       hard to stop.  Do not start them."
18           By the early 1960s there was widespread
19       information in magazines and newspapers
20       referring to the addiction risks of cigarettes
21       and advocating different methods to quit.  We
22       saw numerous articles in TIME, Newsweek, LIFE
23       Magazine and Reader's Digest, periodicals that
24       had widespread national circulation in the
25       1950s, '60s and '70s that recommended and 4024
1       proposed methods on how to stop cigarette
2       smoking.  And this is illustrated in Defendant's
3       Exhibits 24, 25, and 26, just a sampling of the
4       articles about how to quit smoking.
5           We saw numerous references in the press to
6       nicotine as the addictive agent of cigarettes,
7       and we saw that by the 1960s there were already
8       smoking-cessation clinics that were opening up
9       all around the country.
10           There were no secrets regarding the
11       addictive nature of cigarettes.  By the 1950s
12       everyone understood that cigarettes were
13       addictive and could be extremely difficult to
14       quit.
15           The only thing that wasn't well-settled was
16       the terminology, whether cigarettes should be
17       formally labeled with the term "addiction" or
18       whether they should instead be referred to by
19       the terms "dependence" or "habituation."
20           In 1964 the Surgeon General didn't believe
21       that "addiction" was the appropriate term for
22       cigarettes and instead used "habituation,"
23       because back then it was felt that if you label
24       somebody an addict you're essentially consigning
25       them to a mental health disease.  And that 4025
1       wasn't considered appropriate at the time.  And
2       that's in the 1964 Surgeon General's Report.
3           So it wasn't until 1988 that the Surgeon
4       General decided to make a change and formally
5       adopt the word "addiction" for cigarettes.  The
6       DSM-5, which was revised in 2014 and was shown
7       to you during the testimony of Dr. Hurt and
8       Dr. Brady and in Mr. Gustafson's closing, is
9       used by physicians and clinicians today to
10       diagnose numerous forms of substance abuse and
11       uses the term "tobacco use disorder."  It
12       doesn't use "addiction" either.
13           During the trial plaintiffs showed you the
14       video of the CEOs from the different companies
15       testifying before Congress in 1994 where they
16       were told, "We have your written statements, so
17       we just want the sound bite for the news.  So
18       you can only answer yes or no to this question.
19       Is nicotine addictive?"
20           And then they go down the line.  "Is
21       nicotine addictive?"  Yes or no?  Yes or no?
22       Yes or no?  Yes or no?
23           You were showed a clip where Mr. Johnston of
24       the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company tried to
25       expound on his answer and he started to say, 4026
1       "Nicotine is not addictive using the traditional
2       definition of addiction, which requires
3       intoxication," and he was cut off.  They said,
4       yes or no.  Yes or no.
5           So, you know, you heard the sound bite, but
6       you didn't hear the written statements of the
7       companies which explained what their full
8       positions were.
9           Regardless, 1994, this happened after
10       Ms. Westmoreland quit smoking.  We shouldn't get
11       caught up in these terms of art.  The plain fact
12       is that it was well-known and widely accepted by
13       the 1950s that cigarettes were habit forming,
14       addictive and difficult to quit, irrespective of
15       what words were used to describe it.
16           Mr. Gustafson talked about the testimony of
17       Dr. LeBow and Dr. Dietz, who engaged in an
18       intellectual exercise about the word
19       "addiction."  And both said something along the
20       lines of if a smoker is addicted then they don't
21       have free choice.
22           Neither of them is an addiction expert, like
23       Dr. Brady and Dr. Hurt.  They answered that
24       question as lay people.  They were led down a
25       garden path by attorneys in litigation and they 4027
1       fell into the trap that plaintiff wants you to
2       fall into here.
3           One more thing on addiction.  Plaintiff
4       talked about the research Liggett was doing
5       using calcium hydroxide to increase the free
6       nicotine available in the cigarette smoke.  At
7       this point in time when this research was being
8       conducted, all of the companies and some of the
9       public health officials were all doing research,
10       working hard to find a cigarette that would be
11       less hazardous.  And this is one of the ideas
12       that Liggett researchers were working on in this
13       regard.
14           You also heard that at one point Liggett
15       added lactic acid and diammonium phosphate --
16       I'm just going to call that DAP -- to Lark
17       cigarettes.  Dr. Cummings confirmed that these
18       substances are used in products other than
19       cigarettes, things like baked goods and corn
20       tortillas.  And this is another example of what
21       you didn't hear anyone say, and that is that
22       adding either of these things made cigarettes
23       more addictive.  No one said that.
24           But you did hear them say that adding both
25       of these things impacted the taste of 4028
1       cigarette.  We know DAP made more sugar
2       available.
3           Now, Dr. Dietz confirmed in his deposition
4       that was read to you that Liggett never used
5       additives to affect the pH, which in turn
6       affects the free nicotine in any commercially
7       available cigarette, including Lark.  He
8       confirmed Liggett used these substances to
9       smooth the taste of the smoke.
10           The design of these -- excuse me.
11           The design of these cigarettes is no
12       different than the design of all the cigarettes
13       smoked by the 60 million people who quit
14       smoking.  But you've had the benefit of hearing
15       expert testimony before you have to answer this
16       question.  And you know that every one of
17       plaintiff's expert witnesses who talked about
18       addiction came in here and confirmed that even
19       people who are addicted can and do quit every
20       day.  While Dr. Brady said it is a constrained
21       choice, it's still a choice.  And only the
22       smoker can make the decision to stop.
23           60 million people have quit smoking since
24       the 1964 Surgeon General's Report.  1.3 million
25       people quit every year.  And according to 4029
1       Dr. Brady, the vast majority of these people
2       were nicotine dependent when they stopped.
3       Everybody can quit smoking.  And Jayme
4       Westmoreland did quit smoking.
5           Even Surgeon General Koop, the Surgeon
6       General who changed the definition of addiction
7       to eliminate the requirement of intoxication,
8       has stated that the individual smoker has to
9       make the decision whether to stop engaging in
10       the behavior.
11           So was Ms. Westmoreland addicted to
12       nicotine?  It's true that the more advanced
13       therapies that are available today to help
14       people quit smoking weren't available before
15       Ms. Westmoreland passed away.  But there were
16       things that were available that she could have
17       tried if she had been inclined.
18           Smoking-cessation clinics were available
19       going back to the 1960s.  Dr. Hurt, who was
20       smoking three to four packs a day, stopped
21       smoking by going to one of those clinics in the
22       1970s.  There's absolutely no evidence that
23       Ms. Westmoreland even tried to stop smoking
24       before the mid 1980s.  Her brother told her to
25       quit after 1980 when he quit smoking, and she 4030
1       essentially ignored him.
2           Now, nicotine gum was available starting in
3       the early 1980s.  I think 1982 was the date that
4       we were told.  But she didn't even try it until
5       sometime when Cydne was in elementary school in
6       the mid to late 1980s.  And no one knew whether
7       she used it the way she was supposed to use it.
8           She used the nicotine patch at some point,
9       too, but neither Mrs. Westmoreland or
10       Mrs. Lambert could say she used it regularly.
11       Mrs. Lambert remembered only three different
12       instances of seeing the patch on her mother's
13       arm, and she didn't know if it was from one
14       prescription or multiple prescriptions.
15           What we do know is while she was using those
16       products she was getting nicotine in her system,
17       so there was clearly something she was getting
18       from the cigarettes other than nicotine that
19       kept her smoking.
20           We know she -- that she stopped smoking for
21       days at a time and quit for about two weeks in
22       1990.  But for reasons known only to
23       Ms. Westmoreland, she returned to smoking after
24       the nicotine was out of her system.  There's the
25       rub.  All of the plaintiff's experts concede 4031
1       this.  In order to quit you have to decide you
2       want to quit.  When she finally decided she was
3       going to stop smoking, she did stop.  She did it
4       cold turkey.  She did it before she felt sick.
5           You heard from the people closest to
6       Ms. Westmoreland about this, her children.
7       Their memories on this were consistent.
8       Mrs. Lambert told you she quit sometime before
9       her diagnosis.  Mr. Westmoreland told you that
10       she quit four to six months before her
11       diagnosis.  Both agreed she quit before she
12       started to feel sick.
13           Remember, these are the people who were
14       closest to her.  They were living with her day
15       in and day out.  Mrs. Lambert was even working
16       with her during this period of time at The
17       Lobster Pot.  So she didn't see her smoking at
18       home and she didn't see her smoking at work.
19           And the medical records indicate that she
20       made significant lifestyle changes about three
21       months before she was diagnosed.  Right here.
22       "She is a person who in the past three months
23       has changed the quality of her life greatly.
24       She stated that she had smoked a pack and a half
25       a day for 21 years." 4032
1           If she had still been smoking, her children
2       would have known.  You can tell these things.
3       You can smell the smoke on her clothes or in her
4       car or in her hair.
5           The plaintiff wants you to believe that she
6       was still smoking when she was diagnosed.  She
7       bases that theory on the testimony of Dr. Pell
8       and Dr. Paonessa, recalled 20 years after they
9       last saw and treated her.
10           This is one of the things that you get to
11       evaluate, the instruction that I put up when I
12       first started, regarding the credibility of a
13       witness.
14           Continued smoking is something that a doctor
15       treating a patient for suspected lung cancer is
16       going to document in his records.  It's just
17       common sense.  And Dr. Paonessa told you that
18       accurately documenting her smoking history was
19       important to her treatment.  If she really was
20       still smoking and it was important to her
21       treatment and important that she stop, why
22       didn't either of them offer to help her stop
23       smoking, offer to prescribe her
24       smoking-cessation aids, which neither of them
25       did?  Instead, Dr. Pell did just the opposite. 4033
1       He recorded that she quit smoking in his
2       records.  "And has quit for the past several
3       weeks."
4           Neither Dr. Pell, who saw her only twice
5       before she was admitted to the hospital where
6       she wasn't allowed to and didn't smoke, nor
7       Dr. Paonessa ever saw her smoke.  But plaintiff
8       would have you accept the doctors' testimony on
9       this matter over her own recollections and the
10       recollection of her brother.
11           Now, with this as the framework for the
12       evaluation of the claim for addiction, let's
13       talk about the DSM-5, which Dr. Brady agreed is
14       the bible that psychiatrists use when diagnosing
15       mental disorders.
16           MR. SALES:  Objection.  No such word was
17       used by the evidence.
18           MS. LUTHER:  Actually, I can pull the
19       transcript, Judge, if you'd like to see it.
20           THE COURT:  I -- overruled.
21           MS. LUTHER:  To qualify for a diagnosis of
22       tobacco use disorder -- remember I told you they
23       don't use the word "addiction" in the DSM --
24       Ms. Westmoreland had to exhibit a problematic
25       pattern of tobacco use leading to clinically 4034
1       significant impairment or distress.
2           So you have to have a problematic pattern of
3       using tobacco within a 12-month period of time,
4       so you're looking at symptoms in a 12-month
5       period of time.
6           You heard the pattern of symptoms.
7       Mr. Gustafson had them up on the board when he
8       went through his closing.  They involve impaired
9       control, social impairment, risky use and
10       pharmacologic dependence.  And these symptoms
11       have to rise to the level of clinically
12       significant distress or impairment.
13           Here there's no evidence that
14       Ms. Westmoreland had a problematic pattern of
15       using tobacco that rose to the level of
16       clinically significant impairment other than the
17       fact that she smoked a pack to a pack and a half
18       a day.
19           And Dr. Brady herself confirmed that the
20       amount that a person smokes alone is not enough
21       to diagnose addiction.
22           And there's no evidence that her use of
23       cigarettes resulted in social impairment.  She
24       went to work.  She took care of her kids.  She
25       took care of her house.  She took care of her 4035
1       dogs.
2           And there's no evidence of risky use.  I
3       think they tried to say something along the
4       lines that there was evidence she had smoked in
5       bed.  But that evidence really isn't clear.
6           There's evidence she kept her cigarettes
7       near the bed and when she got out of bed as she
8       was walking to the bathroom, she had a
9       cigarette.  So smoking in bed would be a risky
10       behavior.  Fires start.  Smoking when you're
11       pumping gas would be a risky behavior.  Smoking
12       when you're in the bathroom of an airplane would
13       be a risky behavior.  There's no evidence of
14       that in this case.
15           When she returned to smoking after
16       successfully stopping for periods of days or
17       even weeks, no one knows why she started smoking
18       again.
19           Dr. Brady confirmed that the physiologic
20       withdrawal symptoms one experiences from
21       nicotine withdrawal typically peak within 12 to
22       72 hours and most are gone after only a couple
23       of weeks.  So her return to smoking after she
24       had stopped for a few days or a couple of weeks
25       likely had nothing to do with relieving 4036
1       withdrawal symptoms.
2           So looking at the evidence from this
3       perspective, it's clear plaintiff cannot meet
4       her burden to the greater weight of evidence
5       that Ms. Westmoreland was addicted, meaning that
6       she had severe tobacco use disorder.
7           Giving her the benefit of the doubt, at most
8       she had mild tobacco use disorder.  Even though
9       she was addicted to nicotine, did that addiction
10       cause her lung cancer?  Definitely not.
11           Like Mr. Gustafson, I want to go over a
12       couple of the more important jury instructions
13       and the verdict form that you will take back
14       into the jury room with you.
15           Now, you heard it in jury selection and I've
16       already said it once, but I'm going to say it
17       again.  Plaintiff has the burden of proof in
18       this case.  You already know this.  It's up to
19       her to prove that Ms. Westmoreland was addicted
20       to smoking and that her addiction to smoking was
21       the legal cause of her death, not the medical
22       cause, the legal cause.  And plaintiff has to
23       prove this by the greater weight of the
24       evidence.
25           So what does it mean for something to be a 4037
1       legal cause?  Here's the instruction.
2       "Addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was
3       a legal cause of Ms. Westmoreland's lung cancer
4       if it directly and in natural and continuous
5       sequence produced or contributed substantially
6       to producing such lung cancer so that it can be
7       said that but for -- but for the addiction to
8       cigarettes containing nicotine the lung cancer
9       would not have occurred."
10           We submit that plaintiff cannot satisfy that
11       burden.  Now, it's a little hard to follow with
12       all the legalese in it, but you'll see the words
13       provided -- or sorry, "produced or contributed
14       substantially to producing."  So the addiction
15       has to produce or contribute to producing --
16       substantially to producing the lung cancer.
17           Rather than parse the words, let me give you
18       an example.  If someone walks across the street
19       and gets hit by a bus, clearly the bus is the
20       medical cause of whatever injuries they sustain.
21       But in order to understand the legal cause, you
22       have to know more about what's going on.  Was
23       the person texting while they crossed the
24       intersection?  Was the light red or green when
25       they crossed the intersection?  You need to know 4038
1       more information.  And were they talking on
2       their cell phone?  Were they paying attention?
3           The simple point being, you need to know
4       more about the circumstances of the individual
5       before you can determine that the addiction is
6       the legal cause.  You need to know all of these
7       things before you can determine whether
8       addiction was the legal cause in this case.
9           Here you get to consider whether
10       Ms. Westmoreland's decision to continue smoking
11       despite warnings all around her was the legal
12       cause of her lung cancer.  You get to consider
13       whether she could have tried harder to quit.
14       And as Mrs. Westmoreland (sic) has admitted,
15       told you herself when she was on the stand, she
16       certainly could have.
17           So here is the verdict form, and these are
18       the first two questions you're going to have to
19       answer.
20           "Was Ms. Westmoreland addicted to cigarettes
21       containing nicotine?"
22           We submit that your answer to that question
23       is no.  If your answer was yes, you would go on
24       to answer question 2.
25           And that question is:  "Was an addiction to 4039
1       cigarettes containing nicotine a legal cause of
2       Ms. Westmoreland's lung cancer and death?"
3           I would submit to you your answer to that
4       question should also be no.  If you answer no to
5       either one of these questions, you're done.  You
6       sign the verdict form and we thank you for your
7       service.
8           If you agree that plaintiff hasn't satisfied
9       her burden of proof and answer question --
10       either of -- if you answer either of those
11       questions yes -- well, actually, no.
12           If you answer question 2 yes -- if you
13       answer either of those questions yes, then
14       you'll go on to consider the next group of
15       questions, which deal with what the plaintiff
16       wants you to focus on in this case, the side
17       story.
18           So let's discuss the side story so I can put
19       everything you heard from Mr. Gustafson in his
20       closing in perspective.
21           Company statements.  I told you in my
22       opening that the plaintiff would spend a great
23       deal of time talking about the statements made
24       by companies like Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds,
25       American Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson 4040
1       Tobacco Company, Lorillard Tobacco Company and
2       even a couple made by Liggett.  And just as I
3       told you they would, they pulled out the worst
4       sound bites from those documents that they could
5       find.
6           Out of approximately 60 million pages of
7       documents, that's what Dr. Cummings told you, 60
8       million pages of documents, you'll have, I don't
9       know, a stack about this high (indicating) back
10       in the jury room with you, maybe a couple
11       hundred thousand pages.
12           Regardless, I'm not going to try and defend
13       the statements.  Frankly, I'm not in a position
14       to defend the statements of the other companies'
15       internal documents.  Liggett wasn't privy to
16       their internal documents and had no control over
17       what they were saying amongst themselves or how
18       they were running their companies and the things
19       that they said and expressed in those documents.
20           I mean, frankly, a lot of what they said and
21       expressed are things that we wouldn't say or
22       even think today.  But it was a different time.
23           Interestingly, there really aren't such
24       inflammatory statements made by Liggett itself.
25       In order to find sound bites from Liggett, they 4041
1       were compelled to go to Liggett's annual reports
2       that were issued to shareholders regarding the
3       annual status of the company.  Really?  I mean,
4       Jayme Westmoreland wasn't looking at Liggett's
5       annual reports.  She certainly wasn't getting
6       her health information from them.
7           Now, you may remember that Judge Day already
8       instructed you on this.  He told you, "Ladies
9       and gentlemen, you will be shown documents and
10       statements that were created by tobacco
11       companies and entities other than defendant
12       Liggett.  It is for you to decide whether these
13       documents or these statements were made as a
14       part of the agreement between Liggett and other
15       tobacco companies to conceal information
16       regarding the health risks of smoking and the
17       addiction -- addictiveness of tobacco.  To the
18       extent you find they were not made as part of
19       such an agreement, you should not consider these
20       documents or statements against Liggett."
21           Annual reports and other internal documents
22       didn't have anything to do with Jayme
23       Westmoreland.
24           In an attempt to make a connection,
25       plaintiff hired Dr. Hurt, a medical doctor, to 4042
1       come here and talk about advertising.  He tried
2       to convince you that those ads meant something
3       to Jayme Westmoreland.  He clearly has his own
4       agenda, again, going back to the instruction I
5       showed you in the beginning.  That's one of
6       things you get to do; you get to evaluate when
7       weighing the weight to give the testimony of a
8       witness.
9           I mean, it was abundantly clear that he
10       doesn't like tobacco companies, and I get that.
11       I mean, really, he treats patients who get sick
12       on a daily basis, and it's got to be frustrating
13       for him to see people engaging in a behavior
14       that has a real chance of making you sick.  But
15       this is an example of one of the things you get
16       to determine or you get to consider in
17       determining the weight to give his testimony.
18       Does he have an agenda?  Absolutely.  He would
19       love to see my client out of business.
20           Dr. Hurt showed us a large number of
21       advertisements from the past 70 years, and I'm
22       not going to spend much time talking about other
23       companies' ads because Dr. Cummings agreed that
24       Liggett didn't participate in the marketing of
25       its competitors' brands.  Liggett isn't 4043
1       responsible for the content of other companies'
2       brands.
3           Now, obviously, Liggett brands didn't
4       experience an increase in their market share
5       because the Marlboro Man was a hugely successful
6       ad campaign.  In fact, we know Liggett's ad
7       campaigns didn't work as the years went by
8       because its market share continued to decline.
9           Dr. Cummings confirmed that by the 1990s
10       Liggett's market share was about 2 percent.  The
11       ads you saw attempted to portray specific
12       company brands as positively as possible so that
13       the different companies who were in pitched
14       competition with each other could gain market
15       share and sell their brands.  There's nothing
16       illegal or improper about that.
17           It's not illegal to have attractive people
18       or glamorous people attempting to market your
19       products.  All the companies do it.  Each one of
20       those ads you saw complied with FTC regulations,
21       and every one of them was legal.
22           What do those other company brands have to
23       do with Liggett?  For that matter, what do they
24       have to do with Ms. Westmoreland?  And the
25       answer to both questions is, absolutely nothing. 4044
1       None of the ads that were shown to you during
2       plaintiff's case had anything to do with
3       Ms. Westmoreland or the facts of this case.
4           You may recall that in my opening I
5       acknowledged that in the past there was a lot of
6       cigarette advertising.  I told you that you
7       might have to decide if cigarette advertising
8       had anything to do with why Ms. Westmoreland
9       continued to smoke.  More to the point, was
10       there anything false in Liggett's advertising
11       that Mrs. Westmoreland saw and relied on in
12       making her decisions to smoke?  Did Liggett fail
13       to warn Ms. Westmoreland of anything that it had
14       a legal obligation to do?
15           Ms. Westmoreland evidently did have
16       conversations with her children regarding her
17       smoking over the years.  But she never told them
18       or anyone else she was close to over the course
19       of her life that she started smoking because of
20       an advertisement or because of anything any
21       tobacco company said or did.  Not a single
22       witness ever said she told them she saw a
23       tobacco company statement, let alone that she
24       relied on it.  But she did tell them that she
25       started smoking to fit in with the boys in 4045
1       neighborhood, her friends, who nicknamed her
2       Moose, to be cool and to fit in.
3           Both Mrs. Lambert and Roxan confirmed that
4       Mrs. Westmoreland -- Ms. Westmoreland told them
5       this.  That is why Ms. Westmoreland -- that's
6       Ms. Westmoreland's own explanation for why she
7       started smoking.
8           Now, speaking of advertising that had
9       nothing to do with Ms. Westmoreland, you saw a
10       series of L&M ads in Mr. Gustafson's closing and
11       you saw a lot of Lark ads.  And plaintiff
12       emphasized ads for Lark's Gas-Trap filter.
13       Plaintiff claims Ms. Westmoreland somehow relied
14       on Lark advertising and because of that
15       advertising somehow believes she was smoking a
16       safer -- not a safe, but a safer cigarette.
17           Let's talk about the Lark filter and what
18       Liggett knew at the time.  The Lark cigarettes
19       that Ms. Westmoreland used were one of many
20       types of filtered cigarettes that were available
21       on the market beginning in the 1960s.
22           We heard testimony that in the 1960s
23       legitimate scientists outside of the tobacco
24       industry were advocating the use of filters to
25       reduce tar and nicotine in cigarettes and to 4046
1       attempt to selectively filter out carcinogens
2       and toxins in cigarette smoke.
3           Dr. Cummings testified about the National
4       Cancer Institute's Tobacco Working Group in the
5       1960s.  That was a coordinated joint effort by
6       public health scientists and industry scientists
7       to use filters and other cigarette design
8       modifications to try to come up with ways to
9       make cigarettes safer.  That was all part of an
10       effort to reduce the risks of cigarettes and
11       create a less hazardous or potentially safer
12       cigarette.
13           Despite these efforts by scientists for the
14       last 50 years, we know today that no one has
15       developed a way to make a safer cigarette, one
16       that removes the carcinogens and toxins in
17       cigarette smoke that cause lung cancer and other
18       diseases.
19           But in the 1960s Liggett and
20       Arthur D. Little were trying in earnest to
21       identify what was potentially dangerous in
22       cigarette smoke and trying to figure out a way
23       to remove it.  One of those efforts was the Lark
24       charcoal filter.
25           We saw evidence that the 1964 Surgeon 4047
1       General's Advisory Committee was very interested
2       in Liggett's research concerning filters.  We
3       saw Dr. Hamill, who worked for the Advisory
4       Committee, record in a 1962 memorandum that he
5       specifically asked Dr. Kensler, who was then
6       working with Liggett, for the information they
7       had on the possibility of creating improved
8       filters.  This is Liggett's Exhibit 44.
9           "The L&M chemists have done a great deal of
10       work on the effect of filtration.  Absolutely
11       sure they will make available all of their
12       information to us."
13           And then on page 2, "Their two primary areas
14       of expertise," referring to Liggett and Arthur
15       D. Little, are number one, "subjecting animals
16       and other biologic systems to exposures to
17       various kinds of smoke, and ciliary motility
18       studies in which Kensler thinks they have
19       developed some unique methodology."
20           So as of 1962 Surgeon General's committee
21       was aware that Liggett was doing its own mouse
22       skin-painting studies and was saying that that's
23       one of Liggett's areas of expertise.
24           Liggett and Dr. Kensler responded to the
25       request from Dr. Hamill, and a fair amount of 4048
1       Liggett's 1963 nine-volume submission discussed
2       the possibility of reducing the health risks of
3       cigarettes by the use of a special filter using
4       activated charcoal.
5           The charcoal was designed to remove certain
6       toxins that are found in the gas phase of the
7       cigarette smoke.
8           Dr. Kensler and Liggett found an innovative
9       charcoal filter that was designed to reduce
10       cilia toxicity, which is damage to the little
11       pulsating hairs in the throat and lungs that
12       were caused by the cigarette smoke, and we did
13       this in opening to demonstrate the movement of
14       the cilia hairs to get the bad stuff out of the
15       lungs.
16           Dr. Kensler reported his research on the
17       charcoal filter to potentially reduce risks in
18       his landmark 1963 New England Journal of
19       Medicine paper that you heard about.  And one
20       entire volume of Liggett's submission to the
21       Surgeon General was devoted to the possible
22       benefits of using an activated charcoal filter.
23           This is just the cover of one of the nine
24       volumes.  "Effects of Gases and Cigarette Smoke
25       on Mammalian Ciliary Activity." 4049
1           The Surgeon General discussed in the 1964
2       report and cited Dr. Kensler's New England
3       Journal of Medicine article.  And I think we
4       have a cull out on that.
5           "Kensler and Battista describe development
6       of a method of bioassay for inhibition of
7       ciliary transport activity involving exposure of
8       the trachea of a rabbit to the test material."
9           So this is just evidence that the research
10       that he was doing on the Lark cigarette on the
11       charcoal filter was information they were
12       sharing with the Surgeon General's committee.
13           The Surgeon General actually went further
14       and specifically found that the activated
15       charcoal filter that was identified by
16       Dr. Kensler was promising and could potentially
17       reduce the harm arising from cigarettes.
18           "Activated carbons differ markedly in their
19       absorption characteristics.  Carbon filters
20       previously employed in cigarettes do not have
21       the specific power to scrub the gas phase.  It
22       has been reported that a filter containing
23       special carbon granules removes gaseous
24       constituents which depress ciliary activity."
25           That's Liggett's research that we're talking 4050
1       about there.
2           Dr. Cummings and Dr. Hurt did not want to
3       tell you about Dr. Kensler's research and the
4       discussion of it in the 1964 report when they
5       criticized Lark's charcoal filter and,
6       significantly, neither one of them could point
7       to any evidence by the Surgeon General or any
8       scientist in any peer-reviewed journal over the
9       past 50 years that challenged Dr. Kensler's
10       research, his methodology or his conclusions
11       that were set forth in that important 1963 New
12       England Journal of Medicine article.
13           Dr. Cummings and Dr. Hurt knew about
14       Dr. Kensler and Liggett's work on charcoal
15       filtration, but they ignored it and didn't want
16       to talk about it.
17           MR. SALES:  Your Honor, may we approach,
18       please?
19           THE COURT:  You may.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
[#DELETED RECESS#]
3           MS. LUTHER:  Thank you.  If I had known you
4       needed a break, I would have drawn an objection
5       earlier.
6           The point of what I was talking about before
7       is not that the charcoal filter was successful,
8       but that it was a good-faith effort on Liggett's
9       part to try and find something that was going to
10       reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.
11           Now, going back to Dr. Cummings and
12       Dr. Hurt.  Dr. Cummings and Dr. Hurt, on
13       cross-examination you may remember Mr. Feiwus
14       talked with them about a 2005 article that was
15       performed by scientists working for the United
16       States Public Health Service.  They were still
17       investigating in 2005 the potential use of
18       charcoal filters as a way to reduce lung cancer
19       risks.
20           This 2005 paper looked at the prevalent use
21       of charcoal filters in Japan.  You may recall
22       this.  And they found that in Japan where they
23       smoke a lot more charcoal-filtered cigarettes
24       than we smoke here, they have a much lower
25       incidence of lung cancer.  So in 2005 they're 4069
1       still exploring the vitality of the
2       possibilities presented by the charcoal filter.
3           The bottom line with regard to the charcoal
4       filter is this:  The Lark charcoal filter, no
5       one can tell for sure whether it's any safer
6       than any other conventional cigarette, but what
7       we can say is that it was a good-faith effort by
8       Liggett and Dr. Kensler in the early 1960s to
9       try to make the cigarette safer and to reduce
10       risk.
11           And, again, the bottom line is no one knows
12       where Ms. Westmoreland got her information that
13       Lark cigarettes were safer than any other
14       cigarette on the market.
15           To put the Lark story in context, let's go
16       back in time to when the debate began.  What
17       does the evidence show about what Liggett did
18       and what does the evidence show about what the
19       other major tobacco companies did?
20           Did the -- the evidence showed that Liggett
21       took a path independent from the rest of the
22       industry during critical parts of the story.  We
23       saw evidence that beginning in the late 1940s
24       and culminating with the 1964 Surgeon General's
25       Report there was emerging scientific evidence 4070
1       concerning the lung cancer risks of smoke,
2       cigarette smoke.
3           The first widely publicized story was the
4       1950 statistical study of Wynder and Graham,
5       which was followed by a study by Doll and Hill
6       in 1952.  And I've said all of this ad nauseam
7       probably, but the bottom line is that the
8       scientists that were performing those studies
9       back then agree that just because of their
10       isolated results that wasn't the end of the
11       story, that you had to do the studies again to
12       try and reproduce the results that they were
13       getting.
14           Mr. Gustafson even mentioned this.  You have
15       to do correlation studies, you know, it's a
16       building upon a consensus.
17           So what did Liggett do in response to this
18       information coming out?  We hired Arthur D.
19       Little.  Well, let me back up.
20           Liggett responded by investing enormous
21       amounts of money in research, biological testing
22       program with its preeminent consultant, Arthur
23       D. Little.  It was -- Arthur D. Little was a
24       reputable scientific firm doing work for major
25       corporations in America at the time and 4071
1       United States Government.
2           The man in charge of Liggett's testing
3       program, Dr. Kensler, was a preeminent scientist
4       from Sloan-Kettering in New York with impeccable
5       credentials.  And together Liggett and Arthur D.
6       Little set out to do two things.  First, to
7       coordinate with Dr. Wynder himself and to see if
8       the Wynder mouse -- Wynder-Graham mouse
9       skin-painting -- try to say that five times
10       fast -- could be reproduced.  The second, to see
11       if they could identify what, if anything, in the
12       cigarette smoke could be identified as the
13       problem.
14           We've talked about this.  You want to -- you
15       have to identify what the problem is in order to
16       try and remove it.  Essentially if the
17       Wynder-Graham tests were reproduced, what in
18       cigarette smoke was responsible for those test
19       results?
20           Now, the Wynder Graham mouse skin-painting
21       test was a landmark experiment.  And when those
22       results were released, labs around the country,
23       not just Liggett and Arthur D. Little, but
24       people at Yale, people at Sloan-Kettering, the
25       Cancer Research Institute and Roswell Park where 4072
1       Dr. Cummings started his career, they all began
2       to try to reproduce Dr. Wynder's studies.
3           Wynder himself said reproducing his studies
4       was an important scientific endeavor.  And he
5       himself participated with Liggett and Arthur D.
6       Little and weighed in on the research that
7       Liggett and Arthur D. Little were doing.
8           You saw the report by Arthur D. Little and
9       Liggett concerning the results of their testing.
10       They were, in fact, able to replicate
11       Dr. Wynder's results, but in significantly lower
12       numbers than what Wynder got.  And they used
13       lower concentrations of tar or no tar at all.
14           You heard Dr. Kensler was reluctant to
15       publish those results because he didn't want to
16       undermine the information that was already in
17       the public record about Dr. Wynder's test
18       results.
19           We know Liggett continued in earnest with
20       its biologic testing throughout the 1950s.  And
21       we know the researchers were able to identify
22       important carcinogens in cigarette smoke that
23       they believed were contributing to the
24       biological activity in Wynder's tests and the
25       other tests. 4073
1           And at the appropriate time Liggett made
2       that science publicly available by publishing
3       its results at the New York Academy of Science
4       in 1960, and even more significantly, providing,
5       voluntarily, all of its research, all of its
6       data to the Surgeon General's Advisory
7       Committee.
8           Plaintiff's experts tried to turn Liggett's
9       positive efforts, its extensive research and
10       consultation with Dr. Wynder and its cooperation
11       with the Surgeon General's committee on its
12       head.  Instead of congratulating Liggett on
13       doing what no other tobacco company did,
14       plaintiff's experts criticized us because we
15       tried to do the right thing.
16           We did independent science on the important
17       issues at hand and made this research available
18       to the public health authorities.
19           Even though Dr. Cummings has clearly not
20       read Liggett's submission to the Surgeon General
21       committee in its entirety, he was still willing
22       to come into this courtroom and testify under
23       oath that we didn't tell them that smoking
24       causes cancer and we didn't tell them that we
25       produced results similar to Dr. Wynder in our 4074
1       mouse skin-painting test and we didn't tell them
2       that nicotine is important in why people smoke.
3           That is just flat-out wrong.  You, again,
4       are going to have Liggett's submission with you
5       back in the jury room.  I just want to highlight
6       a few things that demonstrate just how wrong
7       Dr. Cummings is on this.
8           The members of the Advisory Committee
9       repeatedly praised Liggett and Arthur D. Little
10       for both the quality of the work and the amount
11       of ground that was covered by their research.
12           In Defendant's Exhibit 46, this is -- these
13       are minutes from a 1963 meeting of the Surgeon
14       General's committee.  And you'll see that
15       this -- the minutes reported, "These minutes can
16       not possibly record the massive amount of data
17       in these reports."  Then it goes on to say, "The
18       chairman thanked Drs. Kensler and Hainer on
19       behalf of the committee for their comprehensive
20       and well-organized presentation, as well as for
21       the documents which had been prepared, and those
22       still to come."
23           Then in Defendant's Exhibit 40, the
24       Assistant Surgeon General at the time wrote to
25       Dr. Kensler at Arthur D. Little.  "We feel that 4075
1       simple acknowledgment of the receipt of the nine
2       volumes which you submitted to us is not
3       sufficient.  Please accept on behalf of
4       Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company and Arthur D.
5       Little our special gratitude for the tremendous
6       time, effort and expense in the production of
7       this material for our use."
8           Then in Defendant's Exhibit 47, this is a
9       memo from the United States Department of
10       Agriculture, the chief of the tobacco laboratory
11       for the government said this about Liggett's
12       submission.  "The report contains a wealth of
13       information, especially with regard to the
14       biological responses of animal systems to
15       cigarette smoke."  Those are Liggett's mouse
16       skin-painting studies.  He goes on to report,
17       "In view of the voluminous amount of material
18       contained in the report, it would be impossible
19       to record here the many findings obtained in the
20       ten-year period of productive collaboration."
21           Now, Dr. Cummings showed you a 1961 Arthur
22       D. Little document called "L&M:  A Prospective
23       Review."  And Mr. Gustafson talked about that in
24       his closing.  That is Plaintiff's Exhibit 112.
25       And this is what the front of that document 4076
1       looks like.  Dr. Cummings told you that Liggett
2       did not share the information contained in this
3       introductory paragraph, that "There are
4       biologically active materials present in
5       cigarette tobacco.  These are cancer causing,
6       cancer promoting, poisonous, stimulating
7       pleasurable and flavorful."
8           Again, I urge you to look at Liggett's
9       submission, because after you've done so I
10       submit you'll conclude Dr. Cummings wasn't
11       sufficiently familiar with what Liggett
12       submitted to the Surgeon General to offer the
13       opinion that we didn't tell them this in that
14       document.  There's a tremendous amount of
15       information, 700 plus pages.
16           Just to give you a flavor of what's in the
17       submission itself, we looked at the nicotine
18       excerpts.  Let's see what else Liggett talked to
19       them -- or told them about.
20           In Defendant's Exhibit 42, if you look at
21       Volume I on page 3, you'll see that Liggett
22       researchers concluded that there is never
23       less -- "Nevertheless, we find enough of the
24       results relating cigarette smoking to death
25       rates to have been obtained in studies 4077
1       adequately meeting our standards for sound
2       inquiry and analysis to satisfy us with respect
3       to the overall conclusion that a gross
4       statistical association exists between cigarette
5       smoking and overall death rates."
6           And they go on to tell the committee that
7       that effect "increases with the degree of
8       smoking, and very probably with the number of
9       years smoked, the amount of each cigarette
10       smoked, the degree of inhalation and (inversely)
11       with the amount of filtration."
12           Now, filters.  Liggett also told the Surgeon
13       General's committee what it found with regard to
14       filters.  This is Defendant's Exhibit 46.
15       Liggett never said filters were safe.  This is
16       what Liggett told public health officials about
17       filters.
18           "Condensate from filtered smoke" --
19       condensate is the tar -- "from filtered smoke is
20       just as or almost as carcinogenic as that from
21       unfiltered smoke.  Filters can, however, reduce
22       the amount of condensate for cigarettes, meaning
23       lower the amount of tar that you're getting per
24       cigarette.  Additives have been found which
25       appear to reduce carcinogenicity of smoke, but 4078
1       none are yet practical."
2           So we're acknowledging that smoke was
3       carcinogenic.  This is what Liggett told the
4       Surgeon General's committee about filters.
5           "But it was still thought that there could
6       be health benefits to removing as much of the
7       bad stuff as could be identified in cigarette
8       smoke as possible."
9           Now, here is the Table of Contents of
10       Volume III of the submission.  It lists
11       materials which have been suggested as possible
12       carcinogens for the human lung and it lists
13       these seven items:  Arsenicals, pesticides other
14       than arsenicals, beryllium, nickel, chromium,
15       free radicals, radioactivity.
16           And then contrary to what Dr. Cummings told
17       you, Liggett did present the results of their
18       own mouse skin-painting studies showing that
19       they had produced carcinomas.  That column all
20       the way on the left there shows cigarette --
21       control cigarette produced nine carcinomas,
22       fifteen papillomas.  You just go down the list
23       there.  So we told them that we were getting
24       results from our mouse skin-painting studies.
25           I touched on nicotine earlier.  I showed you 4079
1       what we told them about nicotine when I first
2       started and was talking about nicotine.  But
3       clearly this information was not concealed by
4       Liggett from the public health officials whose
5       job it is to protect health of the country.
6           Even with this information, the public
7       health community didn't find that nicotine was
8       addictive until they decided to eliminate the
9       requirement of intoxication so that they could
10       call cigarettes addictive.
11           So let's look at the L&M Perspective again.
12       Just based on this quick review of a few pages
13       out of a 700-volume submission, I have
14       demonstrated to you that Liggett told the
15       Surgeon General's committee that there are
16       biologically active materials present in
17       cigarette tobacco that are cancer causing,
18       cancer promoting, poisonous, stimulating,
19       pleasurable and flavorful and habit forming.
20           It's very easy for Dr. Cummings and Hurt to
21       come in here 50 years later and apply
22       present-day scientific standards about what we
23       know about disease causation to Liggett in the
24       1950s and '60s, but that's not a fair judgment
25       and it's not accurate. 4080
1           The scientists working for Liggett did
2       exactly what legitimate scientists do.  They
3       replicated an important experiment and then
4       built upon that research with new experiments,
5       testing new hypotheses, and then they shared
6       their data, the information they had regarding
7       their testing program, and they identify for the
8       public health authorities specific carcinogens.
9       Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, they mention
10       that in the submission.  Benzo(a)pyrenes, they
11       mentioned that in the submission and a host of
12       others that they found in cigarette smoke.  It's
13       all in the submission.
14           Now, let's contrast Liggett's responsible
15       conduct with its competitors, the other tobacco
16       companies in the 1950s.  What did they do?
17       Dr. Hurt and Dr. Cummings testified to exactly
18       what these other companies did.  They got
19       together at The Plaza Hotel in 1953.  They hired
20       the PR firm Hill & Knowlton.  They created an
21       organization called the Tobacco Industry
22       Research Committee, otherwise known as the
23       Tobacco Industry Research Committee, and they
24       didn't conduct serious science.  They engaged in
25       a campaign of disinformation. 4081
1           Dr. Hurt or Dr. Cummings, I confess I don't
2       remember which now, agreed that Liggett didn't
3       participate in any of those activities.  And
4       Dr. Hurt said it was because Liggett wanted to
5       avoid the controversy.  And we also know this
6       because of the 1958 document that was authored
7       by tobacco company scientists from England that
8       Mr. Gustafson showed you.  Let's see what they
9       write about Liggett.  This is Plaintiff's
10       Exhibit 110.
11           "Liggetts (sic) felt that the problem was
12       sufficiently serious to justify large-scale
13       investment by the company directly in
14       experimental research on smoke and cancer,
15       accepting privately that a strong case against
16       tobacco had been made out and avoiding any
17       public comment until their own research had
18       provided something concrete to offer."
19           "We were told that Liggetts (sic) have
20       already invested considerably more in this work
21       than the combined donations of the rest of the
22       industry to TIRC."
23           That's at page 5 of that document.  Unlike
24       these other companies, Liggett engaged in
25       serious science, and it didn't speak on 4082
1       issues until it had solid, concrete science to
2       offer.  And when it did have those scientific
3       results, we know what it did.  It published
4       those results to scientists, health officials
5       and the Surgeon General.
6           So what would Mr. Gustafson have you
7       believe?  He wants you to believe that all these
8       companies are the same.  He wants you to buy
9       into guilt by association.  Just because Liggett
10       was a tobacco company, it should be lumped in
11       with all these other tobacco companies; that
12       somehow, despite these facts, that its conduct
13       is indistinguishable from all these other
14       tobacco companies.
15           But you shouldn't accept that.  There's no
16       evidence of it.  Plaintiff's whole conspiracy
17       theory rests on Liggett joining The Tobacco
18       Institute in 1958 and its extremely limited
19       membership in the Council for Tobacco Research
20       from March of 1964 until January of 1968.
21           Their claim is that because Liggett was a
22       member of the industry lobbying group called The
23       Tobacco Institute it is now responsible for what
24       every other tobacco company did or said for a
25       50- to 60-year period of time. 4083
1           MR. SALES:  Objection, Your Honor.  Contrary
2       to the Engle findings and the Court's
3       instructions.
4           THE COURT:  Let's approach.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
14           MS. LUTHER:  So I was talking about the
15       Tobacco Institute.  And you heard what
16       Dr. Cummings said about the Tobacco Institute.
17       He conceded that it had many members, not just
18       members of the tobacco manufacturing variety.
19       It included tobacco farmers, wholesalers, other
20       people involved in the industry.  And he
21       conceded that those people weren't part of the
22       conspiracy even though they were members of the
23       Tobacco Institute.
24           The evidence showed that Liggett was a minor
25       player, at best, in terms of financial 4093
1       contributions to the Tobacco Institute and in
2       terms of governance and control.  According to
3       Dr. Cummings, over a 40-year period of time
4       Liggett only contributed $1.8 million, about
5       45,000 a year.  That's .3 percent of the total
6       contributions by the rest of the industry.
7           Plaintiff wants you to believe that every
8       letter, every comment, every statement made by
9       the Tobacco Institute or by Philip Morris,
10       R.J. Reynolds, American Tobacco Company or the
11       other tobacco companies on smoking and tobacco
12       and health-related issues is somehow
13       attributable to Liggett and somehow part of a
14       grand conspiracy.
15           MR. SALES:  Objection, Your Honor.  Same
16       grounds just argued.
17           THE COURT:  Hold that thought.
18           Sustained.
19           MS. LUTHER:  Ask yourself what documents or
20       letters did you see from Liggett personnel
21       authorizing or directing Tobacco Institute
22       conduct or Tobacco Institute PR statements or
23       comments.  None.  All of the directions came
24       from the major companies, Reynolds, Brown &
25       Williamson, Philip Morris.  And, in fact, other 4094
1       than documents from the Tobacco Institute with
2       all these other competitor companies, what
3       public statements, if any, did you see from
4       Liggett itself?
5           MR. SALES:  Objection.  Page 5 of the
6       instructions.
7           THE COURT:  You're going to have to approach
8       on that one.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
13           MS. LUTHER:  Anyways, now we were just
14       talking about the direction of The Tobacco
15       Institute and whether there was any documents or
16       anything along those lines showing that Liggett
17       was controlling its actions.
18           This issue really bears on the issue of
19       punitive damages that I'm going to talk about at
20       the end.  But it is relevant to the
21       reprehensibility conduct -- reprehensibility of
22       the conduct that Mr. Gustafson talked about.
23       And I will tie it all together when I get to
24       that section.  Okay?
25           So you saw a bunch of ads for L&M and you 4103
1       saw a bunch of ads for Lark.  And with regard to
2       the public statements you saw and with regard to
3       the advertisements, it's Liggett's position that
4       they had no bearing whatsoever on
5       Ms. Westmoreland.
6           So when you go back to the jury room and
7       you're instructed on the law and you have to --
8       actually, let's see.  I lost my place in all
9       that time up in the sidebar, so let me see where
10       I am.
11           Okay.  So with respect to all of the
12       statements by the TI and the CTR and the other
13       companies that you've seen, Liggett or anyone
14       else, did any of those statements play a role in
15       regard to Ms. Westmoreland's decisions to start
16       smoking, to continue smoking or to not quit
17       smoking?  And there isn't a stitch of evidence
18       that any of this made any difference to her at
19       all.
20           We know at every turn, every time she was
21       warned of the risks of smoking, she turned a
22       blind eye to it.  When her brother told her she
23       should quit, she told him to talk about
24       something else or she ignored him.  And we know
25       that from '66 on, there was 4104
1       congressionally-mandated warning on the
2       cigarette packs and from '72 the warnings were
3       on the ads.  They made no difference to
4       Ms. Westmoreland.  She smoked because she wanted
5       to smoke.  Smoking calmed her.
6           So the shortcut is no matter what you
7       determine about the conduct of Philip Morris or
8       Reynolds or the TI or even Liggett, did any
9       statement or advertisement or conduct whatsoever
10       by these companies have anything to do with her
11       smoking decisions?  The overwhelming evidence is
12       that it didn't.
13           Even Ms. Lambert said that she didn't know
14       what the companies could have done or said that
15       would have changed her mother's smoking
16       behavior.
17           She was asked, "And what specifically do you
18       think the companies should have said that you
19       have any reason to believe would have made a
20       difference in your mother's decisions as it
21       relates to her smoking cigarettes?"
22           And her response was, "I'm not sure."
23           This is their burden of proof, and they
24       haven't met it.  They haven't proven with the
25       greater weight of the evidence, and this is 4105
1       reliance instruction, and this is what they have
2       to prove.  So the issue -- I think I got it.
3       Slide it over just a bit.
4           "The issue for your determination on
5       plaintiff's claim for concealment is whether the
6       concealment or omission of material information
7       regarding the health effects of cigarettes or
8       their addictive nature by Liggett Group was a
9       legal cause of Ms. Westmoreland's lung cancer
10       because Ms. Westmoreland reasonably relied to
11       her detriment that Liggett Group would not
12       conceal or omit disclosure of such material
13       information.  Material information is that
14       information which would have made a difference
15       to Ms. Westmoreland's actions had it been
16       disclosed."
17           And you're going to get a comparable
18       instruction with regard to the conspiracy
19       question.
20           Now I'm going to talk briefly about the
21       information that was publicly available
22       concerning the health risks of smoking while
23       Ms. Westmoreland was alive.  The evidence shows
24       that by the 1920s and '30s, the health risks of
25       cigarettes were widely known in the United 4106
1       States.  People referred to cigarettes as
2       "coffin nails" because they associated
3       cigarettes with disease and death.  And when I
4       say "coffin nails," I'm talking about the stuff
5       that you nail your coffin shut with as opposed
6       to a cough.
7           Because of the widely perceived health risks
8       of cigarettes, many states, including Florida,
9       banned the sale of cigarettes in the 1920s.
10       When that proved unworkable, the bans were
11       repealed, but cigarettes were still associated
12       with disease and death.
13           Plaintiffs say that Ms. Westmoreland
14       couldn't have known the risks.  With all of this
15       information out there, there's no way that it
16       was lost on her by the marketing advertising
17       campaigns of the major tobacco companies.  Ask
18       yourselves, is this really a credible argument?
19       Does this make any sense?
20           So let's go back to the verdict form
21       questions.  We've already talked about questions
22       one and two that I submit would be
23       appropriately -- appropriately answered with
24       nos.
25           The third question that you're going to be 4107
1       asked to answer is, "Please state the percentage
2       of any responsibility which was a legal cause of
3       Jayme Westmoreland's lung cancer and death that
4       you charge to:  Liggett Group and Jayme
5       Westmoreland."
6           And I previewed for you in jury selection
7       that if you get this far, I'm asking that you
8       write "100 percent" on the line for
9       Jayme Westmoreland.
10           And then it goes on to question 4.  If you
11       don't agree with me, you'll answer questions 4
12       and 5, "Was the concealment or omission by
13       Liggett Group of material information concerning
14       the health effects or addictive nature of
15       cigarettes, or both, a legal cause of
16       Jayme Westmoreland's lung cancer and death?"
17           No.
18           "Did the agreement of Liggett Group with the
19       other companies and entities to conceal or omit
20       material information concerning the health
21       effects or addictive nature of cigarettes, or
22       both, a legal cause of Jayme Westmoreland's lung
23       cancer and death?"
24           And, again, we submit you should respond
25       "no" to that question. 4108
1           Now, one of the last things I want to talk
2       to you about are punitive damages.  And what
3       you're being asked to decide today is whether or
4       not punitive damages should be awarded in this
5       case.  You're not deciding the amount at this
6       point in time.
7           If you say, yes, that punitive damages
8       should be awarded, there will be another phase
9       of the trial.  There will be additional
10       witnesses and evidence presented to you, and
11       you'll have a second round of deliberations in
12       which you determine what an appropriate amount
13       of punitive damages should be.
14           But what you need to understand is any
15       punitive damages that would be awarded would go
16       to Ms. Lambert and Mr. Westmoreland, and only
17       Mrs. Lambert and Mr. Westmoreland.  And the
18       purpose of punitive damages is to punish and
19       deter.
20           If you decide they're entitled to money to
21       compensate them for their mother's death, you
22       compensate them fully for their mother's death
23       through the award of compensatory damages.
24       Punitive damages are additional money awarded to
25       them above and beyond any compensatory damages 4109
1       you might award.
2           The judge has instructed you on the standard
3       for awarding punitive damages.  As I just
4       mentioned, they're intended to punish Liggett
5       for its allegedly wrongful conduct, and they
6       must be based on Liggett's conduct by itself,
7       not the conduct of any other tobacco company or
8       entity.  The burden is on plaintiff to prove by
9       clear and convincing evidence, not by the
10       greater weight, but clear and convincing
11       evidence that she is entitled to an award of
12       punitive damages.
13           I submit that there is no basis for punitive
14       damages here.  And we don't believe you should
15       reach this issue.  But if you do, you should
16       know that the clear and convincing standard is a
17       much higher standard than the one used for you
18       to find in plaintiff's favor on the rest of her
19       claims.
20           Clear and convincing evidence is evidence
21       that is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion
22       and of such weight that it produces a firm
23       belief or conviction without hesitation as to
24       the matter in issue.
25           Here, whether there's any such evidence that 4110
1       Liggett's wrongful conduct caused damage to
2       Ms. Westmoreland and whether it's necessary to
3       send a message to Liggett to punish Liggett for
4       the way it's currently doing business.
5           Cigarettes are a legal product in this
6       country.  And you've seen from the documents in
7       evidence that back in the day, Liggett acted the
8       way a responsible cigarette manufacturer should
9       have acted.  It conducted independent research
10       to corroborate the results of Dr. Wynder's mouse
11       skin-painting studies.  It turned over almost a
12       decade's worth of research to the Surgeon
13       General's committee, and the information
14       provided to the Surgeon General's committee was
15       instrumental in allowing the Surgeon General to
16       conclude in 1964 that smoking was a cause of
17       lung cancer in men.  And even after the warnings
18       went on the packs, Liggett continued to do
19       research and development and try to make its
20       products safer for smokers.
21           Liggett today is the smallest of the major
22       tobacco companies.  It has approximately
23       two percent of the market.  Dr. Cummings told
24       you that.  Back in 1996, it was the first
25       tobacco company to publicly admit that smoking 4111
1       causes certain diseases and is addictive.
2           And you heard that Congress mandates what
3       the warnings should be on cigarette packs.
4       Well, Liggett puts a voluntary warning on its
5       pack that's not required by Congress, and you
6       heard testimony about that.  Liggett today puts
7       a warning on its packs of cigarettes that
8       smoking is addictive.
9           Liggett is doing business as a responsible
10       tobacco manufacturer.  More importantly, and not
11       to beat a dead horse, but Liggett's conduct over
12       the years had no bearing on Ms. Westmoreland.
13       Liggett does not deserve to be punished.  In a
14       case in which Mrs. Lambert admits her mother
15       could have tried harder to quit, and her own
16       decisions and actions were a legal cause of her
17       lung cancer, there should be no question that
18       punitive damages are inappropriate.  And you
19       should answer no to question 8 if you get there.
20           Question 8 says:  "Please state whether you
21       find by clear and convincing evidence that
22       punitive damages are warranted against Liggett
23       Group, LLC under the circumstances of this
24       case."
25           Like I said, if you get there, we would 4112
1       request that you answer no.
2           So I sit down now, and Mr. Sales is going to
3       get up.  And he has rebuttal because, again,
4       they have the burden of proof in the case.  I
5       want you to remember some key points that tell
6       you everything you really need to know to decide
7       the issues in this case.
8           You all know that we enjoy a tremendous
9       amount of freedom in this country.  We have the
10       right to make decisions and lifestyle choices
11       that aren't always in our best interests.  But
12       with that freedom comes the obligation to accept
13       personal responsibility for the consequences,
14       and in the end, that's what this case is really
15       about.
16           Are we going to hold Liggett liable, legally
17       responsible for the informed decisions of a
18       strong and independent woman who lived her life
19       the way she wanted to live it based on the
20       evidence that you've heard?  I think the answer
21       is clear.
22           Mr. Sales is going to have an opportunity to
23       get up and have the last word.  I don't know
24       what he's going to say.  But when you listen to
25       him, ask yourself the following:   What does 4113
1       this have to do with Ms. Westmoreland?  What
2       does this have to do with the story of
3       Ms. Westmoreland?  What does this have to do
4       with the story you've heard over the course of
5       the last two and a half weeks about
6       Ms. Westmoreland?
7           The evidence supports one and only one
8       verdict, and that is a verdict for Liggett.
9           I want to thank you again for your
10       attention.  It took a little longer than I
11       thought it was going to.
12           We really appreciate the patience that
13       you've shown throughout the course of this
14       trial.  And on behalf of Liggett and the rest of
15       my team, thank you very much.
16           THE COURT:  Counsel.
