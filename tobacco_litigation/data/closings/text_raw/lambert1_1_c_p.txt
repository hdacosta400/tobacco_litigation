9           MR. SALES:  Thank you, Your Honor.
10           Members of the jury, good afternoon.  I'm
11       probably short on time, and so my thanks are
12       going to be short as well because the clock is
13       ticking.  It's almost the end of the day.  It's
14       almost time for you all to do what is the most
15       important responsibility that the jurors or
16       anyone in this courtroom have in the end.  But
17       on behalf of my clients and our clients and our
18       group, and I know I speak for defense counsel as
19       well, the Court, the bailiff, our wonderful
20       clerk and court reporter, everybody is very
21       grateful for all the reasons that have been
22       pointed out.  I want to begin by starting and
23       saying that I'd like to just focus for a moment
24       on things that counsel for Liggett began within
25       and ended with in her closing argument and state 4119
1       areas of agreement about the case and areas
2       about which we disagree and disagree very much.
3       Because counsel told you in closing argument
4       that this is not about the public.  It's about
5       one smoker and only one smoker.  And it's not
6       about the other companies.
7           And we disagree with that, and we disagree
8       with that for reasons that you've already heard
9       because I want to begin where counsel ended.
10       And at the end of your deliberations and as you
11       reach the questions on the verdict form, we ask
12       and we hope that you will be answering the
13       question of punitive damages.
14           And I want to talk a little bit about what
15       those standards are, because counsel has
16       suggested to you that this case and your work,
17       your important work from this point forward has
18       nothing to do with everybody else.  And it very
19       much does so, because punitive damages are
20       warranted if you find by clear and convincing
21       evidence that standard that was just addressed
22       by defense counsel, among other things, if there
23       was a reckless disregard for human life for the
24       safety of a person exposed to the effects of the
25       conduct of the party sitting in Liggett's 4120
1       position.  And also -- also this is the Court's
2       instruction, you're going to have this in the
3       jury room -- if they wantonly and recklessly
4       disregarded the safety and welfare of public.
5       We've got plenty of evidence of that in this
6       case, some of which I'm going to review with
7       you.  And if they show the reckless indifference
8       to the rights of others.
9           And what you've just heard is that Liggett
10       expects when you get to this point in your
11       deliberations that they should be exonerated
12       because they were a two-percent player, at least
13       that's what they tell us currently, current
14       times, in a conspiracy that you have heard has
15       resulted in the loss of life as a result of
16       persons exposed to the conduct of this defendant
17       and its co-conspirators, 20 million people.
18           The other instruction you have from the
19       Court, while you can't consider similar harms
20       suffered by those 20 million in awarding amounts
21       of punitive damages, you can accept in assessing
22       the reprehensibility or wrongness of Liggett
23       Group's conduct in this case.
24           So we disagree, because that's exactly what
25       the instructions tell us that on those 4121
1       questions, those end-of-the-case questions,
2       end-of-the-deliberations questions that this
3       case is very much about that.
4           And we also disagree that it's not about the
5       other companies, because the parties have
6       referred to and the Court has referred in its
7       instructions to the issue of the conspiracy.
8       This is part of the law that is to guide you in
9       your deliberations.  And what do we learn from
10       it?  "Each party," that would include this
11       party, "to a conspiracy is responsible for the
12       acts or omissions of any other party to the
13       conspiracy so long as the acts or omissions were
14       in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Accordingly,
15       Liggett Group is responsible for its own acts
16       and for the acts of the other companies,
17       organizations taken in furtherance of the
18       conspiracy."
19           And it lists them.  American Tobacco, that's
20       who got it going.  That's the guy who was quoted
21       in the Canasta Pajamas article, denying what's
22       in there.  Brown & Williamson, those are the
23       folks that didn't tell anybody that filters
24       don't do any good.  Lorillard Tobacco Company,
25       they're the company, among other things, that 4122
1       were trying to juice the cigarettes up with
2       ammoniation, among others.  Philip Morris,
3       they're the ones that were telling themselves
4       that they just had to get the rat to push the
5       lever again.  And then we have the more frequent
6       appears, Reynolds, Tobacco Institute, you've
7       heard a lot about them, and the CTR.
8           And Liggett wants a pass and wants to
9       suggest to you that they should be exonerated
10       for all of the things that those parties
11       concealed as part of this conspiracy.  And there
12       isn't any question about what the conspiracy was
13       about, because, again, we have the Engle
14       findings, which are the law that guides you in
15       the case and tells you what it is that you are
16       to be thinking about, at least with respect to
17       the law.
18           And I've drawn these kind of goofy arrows on
19       there because I want to acknowledge that we
20       understand all of this, and you've heard this
21       repeatedly that the findings don't apply unless,
22       and that's where the "if" comes in, that you
23       find that Ms. Westmoreland was an Engle class
24       member.
25           But if that's the case, then the evidence is 4123
1       overwhelming in that regard.  They haven't
2       really touched that.  More on that in a moment,
3       perhaps, if we have time.
4           The cigarettes that she smoked, and that's
5       every one of these, if you find that she was an
6       Engle class member, they were -- these are the
7       Court's words, "defective and unreasonably
8       dangerous."  That's important for a whole host
9       of reasons, not the least of which is when you
10       go to assess the reasonableness of
11       Ms. Westmoreland's conduct, we're assessing the
12       reasonableness or unreasonableness of her
13       conduct consuming products that as a matter of
14       law in this case, if you find that she was an
15       Engle class member, were unreasonably dangerous
16       and defective.  Or is it defective and
17       unreasonably dangerous?
18           And then there's the other law.  And the
19       other law, again, tells us that these other
20       defendants, they matter if the things that were
21       being done during the period of time of this
22       lady's life were things, I would submit to you,
23       that mattered to her or would have mattered to
24       her.  And didn't she have the right to know?
25       Didn't she have the right to know some of these 4124
1       things you've heard about in this court?
2           Because, yes, while they were competing --
3       and I'll get to that in a few moments -- stories
4       about does it cause cancer, does it not cause
5       cancer and much, much later, the fight about the
6       addictiveness of nicotine contained in
7       cigarettes, there was no -- there was no
8       expression publicly of the things that you've
9       learned that you know that the defendants kept
10       secret, the defendant here, I should say, and
11       its co-conspirators.  Some of these apply to
12       Liggett.  Some of them do apply to other --
13           MS. LUTHER:  Objection, Your Honor.
14           THE COURT:  Approach.
15 SIDEBAR CONFERENCE:
16 17     Court outside the presence of the jury:)
18           THE COURT:  Your objection is to the --
19           MS. LUTHER:  Demonstrative.  The very first
20       one says "targeting you," which is talking to
21       the jury, so he's implying we're targeting the
22       jury.
23           THE COURT:  Might be a clerical mistake.

2           MR. SALES:  Yes.  My bad.  I'm sorry.  I
3       changed it to --
4           THE COURT:  Clerical mistake corrected.
5           MS. LUTHER:  Okay.  "Youth."
6           MR. SALES:  My brain works faster than my
7       scribble.  Can you put that back up there?
8           There is no evidence in this case that, as
9       you know from documents from Liggett and from
10       R.J. Reynolds --
11           MS. LUTHER:  Objection, Your Honor.
12           MR. SALES:  Oh, sorry.
13           MS. LUTHER:  Your Honor, I object to this
14       demonstrative in its entirety, the use of the
15       word --
16           THE COURT:  Come on up.
17 SIDEBAR CONFERENCE:
18 19     Court outside the presence of the jury:)
20           THE COURT:  I'm inclined to agree.
21           MR. SALES:  I'll take it off and just argue.
22           THE COURT:  Argue your points.  You want a
23       chalkboard?
24           MR. SALES:  No. I'll just write it.
25 END OF SIDEBAR CONFERENCE 4126
1 2     Court and jury:)
3           THE COURT:  We're going to go ahead without
4       that demonstrative.
5           MR. SALES:  I'm sorry.
6           -- that youth was targeted.  We know that
7       from R.J. Reynolds documents.  We know that from
8       Liggett's documents.  There's never been any
9       evidence in this case that that was disclosed to
10       the public.
11           Would that make a difference to smokers in
12       this country?  That there was an express
13       interest and desire to addict young people and
14       an understanding that you needed to get them
15       while they're young and get them to commit is
16       exactly what happened in this case to a
17       particular brand, because that's the key to
18       success in this industry.  The industry knew
19       these things would happen; that is to say that
20       people would become addicted.
21           There's never been any indication that in
22       her entire period, the entire period of
23       Ms. Westmoreland's life that she had an
24       understanding of these matters, that they knew
25       that she was at risk for cancer and death, that 4127
1       they knew that filters don't work, that they
2       knew that lights were no safer, that they knew
3       that they were trying to increase the effects of
4       nicotine.
5           And they come in and they tell you that that
6       would make no difference to someone who has
7       spent decades smoking and a portion of that
8       period of time, the end of her life, trying to
9       quit smoking.  And that they knew that these
10       products were unreasonably dangerous, and they
11       knew also, as you see very clearly the document
12       from The Tobacco Institute in 1968, that they
13       were lying to the public about these other
14       matters because they were trying to sell
15       cigarettes.
16           And, yes, you know, it's true that there are
17       separate claims for Liggett and the conspiracy.
18       And counsel has addressed some of these issues
19       with respect to the history of Liggett.  And at
20       the end of some of this discussion, it was
21       indicated that Liggett, according to counsel,
22       should be congratulated for its work.
23           Let's just take a little trip down history
24       lane, the history of Liggett, some of which
25       you've seen in this case.  And these were not 4128
1       documents that were cherry-picked among the
2       millions.  They're the ones that matter that we
3       are aware of in this case.  And we know in 1956
4       that the mouse-painting studies that they did
5       were finished.  Did they tell the public that
6       they had replicated that work?  No, they didn't.
7       And that's what Dr. Cummings said.
8           In 1963 when they were communicating with
9       the Surgeon General about those matters, they
10       did identify that they had replicated work that
11       was already in the public to some extent.  But
12       what Dr. Cummings was telling you and what the
13       undisputed evidence is, is that they never
14       acknowledged that cigarettes caused cancer in
15       people, real people.  Not that they depress
16       ciliary activity, which they demonstrated
17       through one of their contractors or scientists
18       with dead animals.  There's no chance that if
19       you're experimenting by design on dead animals
20       that you're ever going to be able to show that
21       cigarettes cause cancer.
22           And did they persuade people that they
23       should be congratulated for those things?  Well,
24       I suppose they did.  And you ask yourself
25       whether or not there was an honest communication 4129
1       of these things.  Because counsel showed the
2       part of the TRIP report that is favorable to
3       them.
4           But the part that is favorable to the
5       plaintiff -- and there are two sides to that
6       TRIP report -- is that when the tobacco
7       brothers, as Mr. Bass called them with Dr. Hurt,
8       came and reviewed these matters here in the
9       United States, with everybody in the country who
10       had a stake in it except one outlier scientist
11       at Yale University, Liggett and everybody else
12       said the same thing:  Cigarettes cause cancer in
13       people.  We know from their witness yesterday
14       that they didn't tell anybody that until 1997.
15           Now, let's just turn the clock back for a
16       moment.  We're going to turn the clock back to
17       1964, that giant story that Mr. Gustafson was
18       talking about.  And imagine, if you will,
19       because he talked about addiction, if in
20       addition to Luther Terry standing there buttoned
21       up reading his report in front of all those
22       reporters who were locked in a room so that they
23       could read it before he spoke, imagine if as
24       part of that presentation this defendant or any
25       of the other manufacturers, because you've seen 4130
1       that they all knew it, had come out and said,
2       yes, we cry uncle; we've been lying to you for
3       ten years; we are sorry; cigarettes cause
4       cancer.  Would that have made any difference?
5       Would that have been front page news?  We submit
6       to you that it would have been and that it would
7       have mattered to people, especially people who
8       were just taking up what they used to call the
9       "habit of smoking."
10           Let's take a little bit more of a trip down
11       memory lane here.  In 1960, one of the documents
12       we're accused of cherry-picking, they
13       acknowledge -- Mr. Gustafson showed it to you --
14       that cigarettes cause cancer.
15           And counsel has suggested to you -- you have
16       it in evidence -- that that 1961 L&M perspective
17       is just saying the same thing as they put in
18       their submission to the Surgeon General in 1963.
19       Well, you can judge for yourself.  But what it
20       is is an acknowledgment, the same acknowledgment
21       in 1958, at least from the perspective of the
22       plaintiff, that cigarettes cause cancer in
23       people.  That's what we're talking about.
24           And were they straight?  Were they square,
25       really truly square with the Surgeon General on 4131
1       that?  You've seen a few documents in this case
2       that you know they talk about things that they
3       were deciding whether to reveal to the Surgeon
4       General or not, and they decided -- we're going
5       to talk about one of those in a moment -- to
6       hide them.
7           You may remember this.  This is put in
8       evidence by Liggett.  It's Exhibit 246 in
9       evidence.  It has this heading on it.  It comes
10       from the Department of Agriculture.  And it
11       talks in the beginning of it about a visit that
12       those folks in Washington had when they met with
13       the A.D. Little people, kind of curiously, in
14       1963.
15           And they're reporting three years later,
16       upper left-hand corner, about the visit that
17       they had with Liggett's contractor.  And this is
18       part of the mix that was going on at the time in
19       1963, the things that were being told to the
20       government.
21           And when Mr. Feiwus cross-examined
22       Dr. Cummings on this document, he showed him --
23       and you might remember it was one of those
24       bullets that are in these slides, these
25       PowerPoint things that we use.  And he showed 4132
1       him number four.  He showed him number four
2       about they acknowledge that there's cyanide,
3       some of these other things.
4           But what you did not see, and this is now in
5       evidence, was what Liggett, through its
6       contractor, the same contractor that they are
7       asking you that they should be congratulated
8       for, the work of A.D. Little, what do they say?
9       "No direct chemical or biological data have been
10       developed to support the epidemiological
11       evidence indicating an association between
12       cigarette smoking and lung cancer."  That was a
13       lie.  They lied to the government straight out.
14           And you look through that nine-volume thing
15       that they are bragging about in this case.  If
16       you ask yourself if you see anywhere, just like
17       Dr. Cummings said, that they say that cigarettes
18       cause lung cancer, that would have been big
19       news.  They didn't do that.  We all can agree
20       this has sort of a mind of its own.
21           And so that's what happened, and that's in
22       the middle there in 1963.  And counsel also told
23       you, you know, in an effort to persuade you that
24       we just browsed through these 60 million pages
25       and try to make them look bad, that those are 4133
1       their own words, words of government officials.
2       We didn't write those.
3           We certainly didn't write this either,
4       because Ms. Luther told you that there ain't a
5       bad document about Liggett in the bunch.  And
6       what do you know?  You know that in 1963 in a
7       document which they say they're going to
8       withhold from the Surgeon General, Liggett's
9       contractor, again, A.D. Little, undertook to
10       estimate how many people were going to die, how
11       many people were going to die from these
12       products who were age 20 and above at that time.
13       That's their work.  And they withheld that from
14       the Surgeon General.
15           And you ask yourself, is this the kind of
16       cold, calculated, really bad stuff that the
17       plaintiff's just cherry-picking out of thin air,
18       other companies, to make this defendant look
19       bad?  Well, no, because they estimated, without
20       any help 50 years ago from anybody in this
21       courtroom, and compared the consequences of
22       these products, these unreasonably dangerous and
23       defective products to car wrecks.  And they were
24       talking about men because the data for men was
25       more available then.  And it was by a factor of 4134
1       almost ten that they knew at the time, while
2       withholding what they knew about cigarettes
3       causing cancer is that they were going to
4       contribute, doesn't matter if it's two percent
5       of the industry or ten percent or a hundred
6       percent, that's how many people were going to
7       die.
8           And that information just never managed to
9       escape from Liggett's files until 1997.  Not
10       this document, just that cigarettes cause
11       cancer.  That would have been big news, really
12       big.  That would have opened the eyes of a lot
13       of people in this country.
14           And one thing that's incredibly interesting,
15       two things about this document, is that while
16       they want to say that -- lost my place -- while
17       they want to say that they were forthright about
18       these matters, remember one of those scientists,
19       Hammond, they were relying on the same
20       epidemiological data.  And by this time, they
21       joined The Tobacco Institute.  Drumbeat after
22       drumbeat, statistics don't matter, it's nothing,
23       they don't prove. They are using epidemiologic
24       data, the same kind of data that estimates how
25       many people are going to be ill that they and 4135
1       their co-conspirators challenged for 40 years
2       after this, 30 years after this and then some,
3       to calculate it.
4           And how cold and calculating is it?  Just
5       shows, I guess, the lack of math awareness.  You
6       can look at the back of this document, it's in
7       evidence, and there's a formula.  That's what
8       they did.  That's what they did.  And that's one
9       of the documents that the plaintiff, according
10       to counsel and Liggett, cherry-picked from all
11       the other available evidence.  And this is a
12       quote.  They provided all of this, their
13       research.  They didn't provide this.  That would
14       have been big news.  And they tell you when they
15       come in here that they should be congratulated,
16       congratulated for comparing this product and its
17       lethal and deadly consequences to car wrecks,
18       unexpected loss of life in the middle of the
19       night, crash, boom, dead, that's their
20       comparison.  And somebody needs to say something
21       about that.
22           Let's talk a little bit about public
23       awareness and what people know and don't know,
24       because, you know, there's an old saying about
25       trees falling in a forest, and if nobody is 4136
1       there to hear it, they don't really fall.  And
2       the reason that saying has staying power is
3       because we all know that's not true.  It's a
4       reflection, in part, on the way people think
5       about things and what they know and they don't
6       know.
7           And what you know, because you've seen it --
8       by the way, this is Dr. DiBacco.  There wasn't
9       any scientific controversy about any of these
10       matters.  His review of history is just wrong.
11       One of the reasons his view of history is just
12       wrong is his view is just, poof, any time these
13       people, The Tobacco Institute or their
14       co-conspirators did anything, this is what the
15       public was doing.  And the $250 billion that
16       these very sophisticated companies spent --
17           MS. LUTHER:  Objection, Your Honor.
18           MR. SALES:  In evidence.
19           THE COURT:  Approach.
20 SIDEBAR CONFERENCE:
21 22     Court outside the presence of the jury:)
23           MS. LUTHER:  I think that was just a
24       knee-jerk reaction to hearing a large number.  I
25       think Mr. Sales is going to say that was spent 4137
1       on marketing.  And I agree it's in evidence.
2           THE COURT:  You withdraw your objection?
3           MS. LUTHER:  I do.
4           THE COURT:  Do you want me to cover you
5       somehow?
6           MS. LUTHER:  No, I'm fine.
7           THE COURT:  Tell him you're sorry.
8       Actually, you owed him that and more.
9           MR. SALES:  No, we're all good.
10 END OF SIDEBAR CONFERENCE
11 12     Court and jury:)
13           MR. SALES:  Very sorry about that.
14           The $250 billion that they spent on
15       advertising, they were doing it because it
16       doesn't -- they were rubes and nitwits who just
17       throw that kind of money around.  Because what?
18       Because, according to the last witness that you
19       heard, when they are clearly, clearly trying to
20       tell people that they're doing something to help
21       them, to save them, to make it better for them,
22       safer, just, you know, make us feel with that
23       filter we're doing okay, that that -- no, this
24       is really about taste, don't you see?
25           And that's what happens when you put 4138
1       blinders on in a case like this, you only look
2       at one side of the picture, and you don't look
3       at the company documents where the company
4       spent, one assumes, because we know from
5       Ms. Luther just recently that they spent a lot
6       of money on research, well, they spent a lot of
7       money on advertising, too, and we know that they
8       tested these things to find out how people would
9       react.
10           And you saw from the documents reviewed by
11       Mr. Gustafson that people look at that and look
12       at their ads and say, hey, that looks like there
13       may be one of those cancerless cigarettes or
14       safer cigarettes out there.  They paid money to
15       find out if people would react that way.  And
16       you saw the review of it from a related document
17       from their lawyers.  There wasn't any mystery
18       about that.
19           And nobody ever came out and said, hey, you
20       know, we're trying to tell you that it's safer.
21       We know it's not.  We know it's really
22       addictive.
23           And the picture that we have on here on the
24       nicotine filter, filter, it's like being in
25       space where we get pure air to breathe, one of 4139
1       those ads.  It's like being in a submarine, all
2       these super-clean, clear places that you'll be
3       protected.
4           Why do we show you the ads of the other
5       companies?  We don't show them to suggest to you
6       that X bought cigarette brand A because they saw
7       the ads of cigarette brand B.  That isn't the
8       point.  The point is that we lived in a time
9       where people responded to these kinds of
10       products that way.  And there isn't any doubt
11       about it.  There isn't any doubt that that was
12       the purpose of these ads, to suggest to people
13       in the face of lots of information on both sides
14       a controversy, they call it, right.  There isn't
15       any question that that had to do with trying to
16       help people believe that they didn't have to
17       worry so much.  That's what filters were all
18       about.
19           And we know from the documents of the
20       conspirators, many of them, that that's exactly
21       what the purpose of all these messages were.
22       And wouldn't it have been useful for
23       Jayme Westmoreland to know that when you're
24       dissecting a filter and responding to ads and
25       telling your son that you're proud because 4140
1       you're switching to light cigarettes that it was
2       all, poof, nothing but lies?
3           So it's just, you know, the very unusual
4       situation.  And one has to appreciate the
5       difficult position that some of us are in in
6       this case to be saying, yes, it's true we said
7       these things for 40 or 50 years, but you knew
8       all about it.  When I say "you," I mean
9       Ms. Westmoreland knew all about it.  But even if
10       you didn't, we were justified in saying the
11       things that we said.
12           Is that really the evidence in this case?
13       And, you know, one of the reasons that we go
14       through these things or we talked about these
15       things, these are in evidence, showing that, you
16       know, Philip Morris and other defendants are
17       speaking publicly.  They're arguing in the New
18       York Times.  That we showed these things not
19       just to show that Dr. DiBacco is way biased, and
20       not much more needs to be said about that, but
21       that the controversy that they invested so much
22       money in spending, by estimates, 365 times on
23       their messages what the government had available
24       to spend on the same thing, that that wasn't
25       trivial. 4141
1           I mean, they have Newsweek articles in
2       there.  You saw this.  There's a Newsweek
3       article, the head of the TIRC, he got equal
4       time.  We showed these things.  TIME Magazine in
5       the '70s over and over and over again.  And what
6       do we know?  For reasons that may seem
7       mysterious, the lawyers and the witnesses are
8       talking about things that happened in New York
9       City.  Well, you heard that these things
10       actually made their way elsewhere.
11           And what do we have?  These are in evidence.
12       I'm not going to go over them, but you'll have
13       them available.  We have the Asbury Park Evening
14       Press.  That's in evidence.  That's near where
15       she lived.  They're picking up those stories.
16       They got the messages from Bowman Gray.  We're
17       in the '60s now.  They've got the messages in
18       there.  Bowman Gray was the president of
19       R.J. Reynolds.  They got equal time.  They got
20       equal time where she lived.  There's a few of
21       them.  And you can take a look at those if that
22       is a matter of interest to you, all right.
23           It was just a theory cigarettes cause
24       cancer.  And then, you know, we have one from
25       Greenville, South Carolina where she lived in 4142
1       the '70s.  It wasn't buried in there, right.
2       Right here.  Horace Kornegay.  You've heard his
3       name.  He got equal time in the '70s.
4           And the suggestion is, you know, that that
5       tree just wasn't falling in the forest where
6       this unfortunate lady lived.  And you know
7       that's not so.  You know that's not so.
8           You know, sometimes things they just don't
9       happen by accident.  Here's an article.  She's
10       living in St. Petersburg by this time in the
11       early '90s.  In 1991.  And there's a blast from
12       the past and a blast from the present.  Lo and
13       behold, Michael Cummings, a witness in this
14       case, is correlinked with Walter Merriman, one
15       of those Tobacco Institute people, in the
16       St. Petersburg Times in the '90s here, '91,
17       about the controversy.  And Merriman says
18       researchers don't know whether smoking causes
19       disease.  And it doesn't make a particle of
20       difference.  Nice choice of words.
21           What the views of our Council for Tobacco
22       Research grantees may be -- they're talking
23       about whether the industry is paying for good or
24       bad science -- we're interested in the quality
25       of their research, not what their personal views 4143
1       are.
2           But the point is the same.  Well into the
3       '90s -- and it's hard for us to think about
4       those things.  And I want to agree with
5       Dr. DiBacco about one think.  Think about what
6       was happening then and not what's happening now.
7       No Internet, right.  So how did they do it?
8       Well, you've seen enough, we submit, to see that
9       this is just a portion of it.  The press
10       releases from The Tobacco Institute, the '50s,
11       the '60s, the '70s, you've seen how these things
12       got picked up.  And the drumbeat and the message
13       that cigarettes don't cause cancer, they don't
14       cause heart disease, attacking the Surgeon
15       General.  And there's some from some other
16       companies in there.
17           It's in fair -- Baron, is that PT5504?  I
18       think it's probably about 200 pages.  Just take
19       a look.  It's another trip through history.  And
20       the industry wants to tell you that nobody heard
21       those things.  You know because you've seen the
22       way that they were picked up over time.  You
23       know that, in fact, they got their equal time.
24           And the suggestion that their power waned in
25       the midst of spending in the second half of 4144
1       20th century, $250 billion on advertising, and
2       these massive grants and bribing the AMA and all
3       those kind, did that just, it just didn't work
4       on anybody.  And you know those things made a
5       difference.
6           Let's talk a little bit about doctors,
7       because -- how did they do it?  It is
8       diabolical.  It's one of the reasons punitive
9       damages are warranted in this case even for the
10       two-percent contributor, because there isn't any
11       question that in 1968, 1958 forward that Liggett
12       was part of the conspiracy.  There isn't any
13       question about it.  And they're in for a pound
14       because that's the way the law of conspiracy
15       operates.  It recognizes that there's a
16       particular danger associated with wrongdoing
17       when people get together and act as one.
18           And it may be true that when Marlboro
19       started to take a little bit of everybody's
20       market share, they said we should use calcium
21       hydroxide, we're going to use ammonium and we're
22       going to use diammonium phosphate, and we're
23       just going to add free nicotine.  You can plug
24       the names in.  Liggett, Lorillard -- it's true
25       they have their own ideas about that.  But 4145
1       point is for us and for the deceased,
2       Jayme Westmoreland, is they never told anybody
3       those things.  And it made a difference.
4           How did they do it?  We talked a little bit
5       about the doctors.  I mean, this is in evidence.
6       I'm just going to review a little bit with you.
7       This is their Tobacco and Health research notes.
8       They're talking in here about that this is their
9       communications with the medical profession.
10       They sent these to every doctor in the country.
11       And they would collect often their own bogus
12       science in reported form about what was going
13       on.
14           Remember that constitutional hypothesis and
15       the multifactorial hypothesis?  Anytime anybody
16       anywhere in the world said it's air pollution,
17       it's virus, it's this, it's that, it sure ain't
18       cigarettes, they put that prominently in these
19       things and sent it to people all over the world.
20           And, you know, when you look through it,
21       they say it's pollution.  They say it's medical
22       technology.  They say -- there's something in
23       here -- not making this up -- about being a nun.
24       There's stuff in here about being divorced.
25       There's stuff in here about genes, family 4146
1       factors.  And it's hard not to -- it seems
2       impossible that anybody could be taken seriously
3       to say this now.  But this is what they were
4       telling the medical profession as a result of
5       work that they were doing.  This is from the
6       early '50s, '60s.
7           And you'll notice, if you look through
8       these, it's always in Britain or Sweden, because
9       we didn't have the Internet, cha, cha, cha, cha.
10       That's ridiculous.  Well, that didn't exist in
11       1962, and they were telling the medical
12       profession, hey, you know what, carcinogens
13       don't cause cancer.
14           And it may seem, in the context of a very
15       serious matter like this, ridiculous.  But when
16       you look through this, they'll tell you that it
17       was baldness -- and I can't remember if when
18       you're bald, it's more likely that you get it or
19       not, or being left- or right-handed or born in
20       March and all kinds of things that just seem
21       ridiculous, but that's what they did.
22           And, by the way, just part of the trip down
23       memory lane, one of the things that they
24       reported to people, doctors -- and this is from
25       1958, was that Japanese people don't get as much 4147
1       cancer as Americans, even though they smoke
2       more.  That wasn't news.  That wasn't news.
3       It's not news today.
4           But, you know, to the extent there's been
5       any suggestion in this case that filtered
6       cigarettes pioneered by these people have caused
7       the Japanese to have less cancer, there's no
8       evidence of that.  And even the thing that
9       Mr. Feiwus showed Dr. Cummings on that doesn't
10       say so.
11           You know, did it work?  Well, Mr. Gustafson
12       showed you the documents from where he said that
13       they congratulated themselves.  But there's more
14       than that to understand why these things
15       mattered to an addicted smoker.  You've got a
16       report, and ignore, if you would, just for a
17       moment, this is in evidence, it's PT3870.  It's
18       a Federal Trade Commission -- do you have that
19       up?  Let's just look through a couple of those.
20           Trade commission report in 1967 when there
21       was concern about filtered cigarettes.  And,
22       actually, I just will read some of those while
23       Baron -- Mr. Philipson is picking them up.
24           "The failure of the warning statement on
25       packages to have any discernible effect on 4148
1       cigarette consumption is easily explainable.
2       The warning statement on the package alone has
3       proved to be ineffective, mainly because people
4       don't seem to pay --" "-- few people --" excuse
5       me.  "-- seem to pay attention to it."
6           And then it talks about the motivations for
7       smoking.  And it talks about the extensive
8       advertising in this country.  Right?
9           And it talks about how the ads blot out the
10       things that people had a right to know.  They
11       never showed people with laryngectomies, their
12       larynx cut out.  They never showed people not
13       being able to make it --
14           MS. LUTHER:  Objection, Your Honor.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
7           MR. SALES:  You'll have this in evidence,
8       while Mr. Philipson is pulling it out, and it's
9       a comprehensive review by the government of not
10       only what it is that people were seeing -- and
11       mind you, we're talking about a time when the --
12       Ms. Westmoreland was about 16 years old, at the
13       bottom of page 12, middle of the bottom of
14       page 12 of the report.  I'm sorry if I
15       miscommunicated to you.
16           Just focus on the bottom.  You don't have to
17       highlight it.  It's all right.  It reviews how
18       many times people are seeing things in a day
19       when we only had three networks for television,
20       including 151.1 million viewers in an individual
21       week in January.  That means 141 viewers age 13
22       to 17.
23           That means, on average, next page, "each of
24       the 18 million inhabitants of the United
25       States" -- that would include Jayme -- "13 to 17 4152
1       viewed 7.8 of the programs during the week in
2       question.  This represents a substantial
3       increase over the 5.9 programs viewed on average
4       by persons without distinction of age.
5       Intentional or fortuitous, teenagers appear to
6       be a prime target for televised cigarette
7       advertising."
8           And there isn't any dispute about that.
9       This document also contains some information
10       about what they were doing with respect to
11       cigarette advertising and the theme of filters
12       and how those were applied in cigarette
13       advertising.
14           And then it has a discussion, which is what
15       I was talking about before, page 23 of the
16       document, the things that they don't say, the
17       things that were not revealed because the
18       industry, including this defendant, individually
19       and collectively wasn't going to tell anybody
20       about it.
21           And, yes, it's true you would display in
22       advertising, you wouldn't want to show someone
23       unattractive in your advertising.  I don't think
24       anybody argues about that.  But the point simply
25       is, is that they were selling a dangerous and 4153
1       addictive product that could kill people after
2       addicting them, and none of those matters were
3       disclosed.
4           You also have in evidence an extensive
5       evaluation of the impact of these things into
6       the 1980s -- into the 1970s, and beginning the
7       1980s in another report.  If you show the cover,
8       from 1981, it's the FTC report, and I urge to
9       you look at the introduction.  I urge you --
10       that's chapter one.  I urge you to look at the
11       discussion about advertising.  Because in 1981
12       when the FTC revisited these matters, they
13       reached the same conclusions and said that the
14       same effect of cigarette advertising -- and by
15       that time, as you know, it had already left
16       television -- the impact of advertising from
17       cigarettes was the same.  It was the most
18       heavily advertised product in America.
19           And by the way, page 2-3 of that is where
20       those estimates that they were spending more on
21       that in a year -- excuse me, in a day than the
22       government had to spend on smoking and health
23       messages.
24           And then in chapter 3 of this report, and I
25       urge you to look at it, again, it's PT3165, it 4154
1       has an extensive evaluation of the things that
2       Americans did not know or knew insufficiently at
3       the time.  How many people didn't really
4       appreciate the risks of smoking and how many
5       people didn't think that cigarettes were
6       addictive.  Take a look at that, if you would,
7       please, and see how many people didn't know the
8       things that Liggett says everybody knew.
9           Let's talk in that regard about this.
10       Because what I heard was that between 1964 when
11       the first Surgeon General's report came out that
12       we've been talking about and 1988, there wasn't
13       any difference in the knowledge about consumers
14       or the public health community about addiction.
15       It was just a name change, just a name change.
16           You know from Dr. Hurt and Dr. Cummings and
17       from the industry's own intransigent fighting to
18       have this happen that that's just not true.  And
19       you don't have to go very far in this document
20       to find out why that's not so, because the
21       Surgeon General, at the introductory sections of
22       the book -- and it's in evidence, I forget the
23       number.
24           MR. PHILIPSON:  3828.
25           MR. SALES:  3828, it's in evidence, this 4155
1       whole thing.  All this stuff is in there.  If
2       you just take a look at the introductory
3       section, the Surgeon General explains why it's
4       so important.  Just like Mr. Gustafson was
5       talking about to re-educate people and tell them
6       that this is an addictive drug that acts on the
7       human brain like other drugs.  He talks about
8       how this is going to lead to the development of
9       other therapies, and that's exactly, as you know
10       from the evidence, what happened.
11           Let's talk a little more about addiction
12       because, you know, we only have to go back --
13       and again, if you just -- sometimes when they
14       say everybody knew, because they called it a
15       habituation in a textbook from 1931, they picked
16       that even though the witness says -- their
17       witness says those things change every six to
18       seven years.  So you haven't had an opportunity
19       to see how, if at all, the controversy might
20       have affected the content of public school books
21       afterwards.
22           But, you know what, we can look.  Again,
23       take a trip right back to St. Petersburg,
24       Florida and see if back then, 1994 May, that's a
25       year of importance in this case, and you know 4156
1       why, you know why for a variety of reasons,
2       because you know that the defendant and its
3       co-conspirators were still saying it wasn't
4       true, that the Surgeon General was wrong.  But
5       right here in St. Petersburg, there was a story
6       in the paper that says from the Times
7       Publishing, so not sure if there was a wire
8       service involved or not.  And what do we know?
9       That's when those hearings were going on we've
10       been hearing about.
11           And remember that fellow, Bill Dwyer, got up
12       in front of all those microphones, the
13       microphones that nobody was paying attention to,
14       according to the defense, in 1979, and says "it
15       was suspect from" -- that guy, okay.
16           What was going on, what was going on back
17       then, Joe Califano, he was a secretary of HEW
18       they called it then, he was attacking, saying
19       watch out, because he's going to come into your
20       bedroom, going to take your cigarettes and come
21       in your bedroom.  Remember that guy?  All right.
22           So part of this hearing part of this
23       hearing, they were talking about -- Mr. Califano
24       came in and said, you know, there was just
25       starting to be a lot of talk about that in 4157
1       1970s about that, we were all victims of the
2       concealment.  This is the Secretary of Health,
3       Education and Welfare.
4           And compare what he probably knew, I would
5       submit to you, as lawyers say, with what Jayme
6       Westmoreland probably knew in the 30 years
7       before this.  "'We were all victims of the
8       concealment and disinformation campaigns of the
9       tobacco company,' said Joe A.  Califano, who
10       once smoked as many as four packs a day, but
11       since has become an anti-tobacco crusader who
12       calls tobacco history's number one serial
13       killer."
14           This is in evidence.  He describes that
15       debate that led up to 1979.  He said that,
16       "Dr. William Polin, then director of the
17       National Institute on Drug Abuse, urged Carter
18       Surgeon General Julius Richmond to pronounce
19       cigarettes addictive, but Richmond resisted,
20       citing a lack of sufficient scientific
21       evidence."
22           There wasn't any lack of scientific evidence
23       inside the files of these folks.  But that was
24       the public status of these things into the 1970s
25       and unknown until secret information was leaked 4158
1       out in the 1990s.
2           And then in another trip down history lane,
3       there's a quote from Walter Merriman.  He was
4       one of those Tobacco Institute people you've
5       seen in some of the videos.  I believe, if not,
6       there were certainly others.  And what he said
7       was -- what he said was "vice president of
8       Tobacco Institute, noting that anti-smoking
9       fervor was far more subdued during the 1960s and
10       '70s when Califano served in government than it
11       is today."
12           That even if Califano and public health
13       officials had tried to get nicotine declared
14       addictive, it would have been almost impossible
15       for him to do anything more than they did.
16           And you know what?  Right here in 1994, the
17       same year that means a lot to a lot of people in
18       this case and in this courtroom, we learn from
19       right here in St. Petersburg that "in recent
20       weeks, there was a growing debate over smoking,
21       has focused on whether nicotine is indeed
22       addictive, as numerous medical experts have
23       maintained, and whether the tobacco industry has
24       been manipulating levels of nicotine in
25       cigarettes to keep smokers hooked on its 4159
1       products."
2           And then at the end, they talk about one of
3       the documents that you've seen in this case,
4       going back, Addison Yeaman, back in 1963.  I
5       think that might be a typo.  But certainly is
6       similar to what's described here.  They knew it
7       back then.
8           So you're asked to measure the conduct of
9       Jayme Westmoreland and decide for yourself, if
10       you would, please, whether when the secretary of
11       HEW comes and says, I didn't know that, I would
12       have done differently, whether it's fair,
13       whether it's fair to say to these folks, my
14       clients, it's all your mother's fault.
15           It's not right.  That would not be a just
16       verdict.  And that's why Mr. Gustafson suggested
17       the figures to you that he suggested.
18           And consider the testimony of the expert
19       witnesses in this case on this question.
20       Because the defense position is even when it
21       comes to filters, not only, poof, you never
22       listened to what we said, you never listened to
23       the gas -- those are all in evidence.  You can
24       look at them.  Not only you never listened to
25       that, but that you should have known better that 4160
1       filters were doing nothing.  The thing that we
2       spent so much money investigating about it,
3       right.
4           And you know not only, not only because this
5       is undisputed from Dr. Cummings, and defense
6       does not dispute this, that there are no safer,
7       you know from the documents, things concealed by
8       co-conspirators in this case that they knew it
9       and they knew it back in the 1950s, they knew
10       it.
11           And you know from Dr. Cummings and Dr. Hurt
12       that the public health community itself did not
13       recognize these things -- what was it?
14       Dr.  Cummings --
15           2001, I believe, was the testimony of
16       Dr. Cummings, and they want to tell you that
17       Jayme Westmoreland, who selected filtered
18       cigarettes -- and there has been testimony about
19       that -- it's all her fault, when sophisticated
20       scientific people who dedicated their lives to
21       these matters during those same decades were
22       telling people to switch to the same products
23       that she switched to, where this defendant was
24       bragging about those things.  And that's why
25       that number, that amount of responsibility of 4161
1       fault you put on her should be small.
2           Finally, I didn't talk about the
3       compensatory damages, the entitlement to
4       punitive damages.  I started with that.  It is
5       very clear.  And we just ask you, you know,
6       think about the way the case was tried a little
7       bit and, you know, there are two sides.
8       Mr. Gustafson said there's only one side to the
9       story.  Well, you know, there are -- there are
10       some parts of this story that have two sides.
11       And that was what the controversy was all about.
12           But at the end of the day, it doesn't
13       matter.  If you find that Ms. Westmoreland was a
14       member of the Engle class, because the
15       resolution, the decisions that you have to make,
16       we would submit to you, on these other matters
17       are transparent and clear in this record.
18           Yes, she deserves some responsibility, and
19       Mr. Gustafson hit that nail on the head.  But on
20       those other questions, on those liability
21       questions, we ask you for these folks, my
22       clients, to return a verdict in their favor on
23       all of those questions, and award an appropriate
24       amount of compensatory damages for their loss.
25           Thank you very, very much.  It's been a 4162
1       pleasure to get the opportunity to do this and
2       do this in a place like this for these folks.
3       And I appreciate everything that everybody in
4       this courtroom contributes to that.  Thank you
5       so much.
6           Thank you, Judge.
