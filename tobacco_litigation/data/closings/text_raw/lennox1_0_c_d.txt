MR. WALKER:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Counsel.  
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  It's nice
to be able to speak with you again.  I know Mr. Finch went
for almost two hours explaining their theory of the case.  I
don't think I'll be anywhere near as long.  And after I sit 132
 1
down, he'll have a chance to talk to you some more, but I
 2
think I can cover what I need to cover with you in about
 3
half that time.  So we'll see how I do.
 4
Before I say anything else, I want to start my
 5
closing the way I started my opening and that's by thanking
 6
each and every one of you on behalf I myself and
 7
Ms. Patterson.  And you've probably seen that I have a few
 8
other team members who kind of come and go as whatever it is
 9
they're working on comes up in court.  We all appreciate
your service, my client, RJ Reynolds, appreciates your
service.  You've been away from your daily lives now for I
guess about a week and we know it's a sacrifice, we all do
and we all appreciate it.
I can tell you too that we're all always trying to
see what the jurors are thinking and kind of looking over to
see if there's any reaction and the only thing that I've
been able to tell so far so is that you-all have taken your
job seriously.  You're paying attention, you've been taking
notes when you heard something that you thought was
important.  And I bet you if you talked with some other
lawyers, you could hear stories about other kinds of jurors
who maybe weren't as diligent as you-all have been in this
trial, so we're all grateful for that.
I want to start by responding to something that
Mr. Finch said.  He said to you that I said in openings 133
 1
there were going to be -- we would serve -- to every story
 2
we want you to be prepared, so that you could listen to
 3
their evidence, but also hear our side of the story and then
 4
when it was our turn to put on evidence, according to
 5
Mr. Finch, we didn't really put much in.  That's not exactly
 6
right.  What I said at the beginning was we were going to be
 7
very respectful of your time and that a lot of the evidence
 8
and things that we wanted you to know and see that were
 9
important for this case we would get from the plaintiff's
own witnesses.
So you heard, by my count, about seven witnesses
in this trial.  They were all called to the witness stand by
the plaintiff or her lawyers.  Many of them were paid, but
each and every one of them gave testimony that was in
support of our defense, every single one of them, and I'll
talk about those as we go along.
We could have called more witnesses to tell you
some of the same things you already heard from their
witnesses.  For example, I could have called a witness to
tell you that Ms. Lennox had the ability to quit smoking
whenever she was truly motivated to do so, but I didn't need
to do that, because she admitted that.  I didn't need to
repeat that testimony from some other witness.
I could have called a witness who could have told
you that Ms. Lennox's COPD, her emphysema, first manifested 134
 1
in the late 1980s, but I didn't need to do that, because
 2
their own witness, the man that they paid to testify to you
 3
about the timing issues, he admitted pretty freely that her
 4
COPD manifested by November of 1989.  It wouldn't have been
 5
a good use of our time or anyone else's to call another
 6
witness to repeat that testimony.
 7
I could have called a witness to tell you that
 8
Ms. Lennox didn't rely on anything that she saw or any of
 9
the public statements or cigarette advertisements that they
showed you, but I didn't need to do that, because their very
first witness told you she wasn't looking at the magazines,
newspapers, and TV programs that Dr. Kyriakoudes talked to
you about.  I didn't need to call a witness to show you
that.
When you saw Ms. Lennox's testimony, at the end of
the case she admitted that she didn't rely on anything.  I
didn't need to call a witness to do that.
But we're at the end of the case and the job that
you folks have to do, which is never an easy one, will be
soon at hand.  That's going to be filling out a verdict
form.  Everything that we've done on both sides of the room
has been to lead up to this verdict form that you have to
fill out to make some important decisions.  And what I want
to do is to try to go through that verdict form with you
question by question and suggest to you what we believe the 135
 1
evidence showed and why you should return a verdict for the
 2
defendant, RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company.
 3
And before I do that, one thing I do want to say,
 4
though, is that that verdict form that you get looks exactly
 5
the way I told you it would look at the beginning of this
 6
case.  Every question on that verdict form is about one
 7
smoker and only one smoker, and that smoker is Karen Lennox.
 8
There won't be a single question on the verdict form about
 9
the American public, about the smoking public, about people
in the 1800s or early 1900s or in Europe or anyplace else.
Only about Ms. Lennox.
And you have heard by now that there's this class,
this class called Engle that's filled with hundreds of other
smokers who have their own facts and their own allegations
and their own lawsuits.  This case isn't about any of them,
it's only about Ms. Lennox.
So what are the key points in the evidence?  I
want to just flag a couple of key points for you and then we
will see how they come up over and over and over again for
each question that you answer on the verdict form.
The first key point that you saw is the evidence.
Ms. Lennox was a willing smoker who smoked regardless of the
health risks, because it was something that she wanted to
do.  She enjoyed smoking.  And the evidence was, just as I
told you it would be, Karen did what Karen wanted to do. Ms. Lennox smoked because she wasn't interested in stopping
 2
smoking.  The evidence in this case is that she went all the
 3
way up until 1997 before she made even the first effort to
   136
 4
try to quit smoking.
 5
Ms. Lennox successfully quit smoking when she was
 6
ready to do so.  She did it when she had a motivation she
 7
never had before her whole life.  It wasn't anything about
 8
the health risks of cigarette smoking, it wasn't losing her
 9
husband to cigarette smoking, it wasn't even when the
doctors told her your own health has been affected by
cigarette smoking, that wasn't what motivates Ms. Lennox, it
never was.  When Ms. Lennox was motivated by wanting to
spend time with her granddaughter and her daughter, said you
can't do that for as long as you're a smoker.  Then and only
then did she have motivation to quit smoking and she did it
cold turkey.
Lastly, Ms. Lennox was never misled by anything
that RJ Reynolds or any other tobacco company said or did.
She told you that.  I went over that with Dr. Kyriakoudes.
Every witness in this case that addressed that issue gave
you the tools that you need to find that Ms. Lennox didn't
rely and I'll talk about that in some greater detail.
Let me start with the first question on the
verdict form.  And I have some help here.  This is first
question, just as Mr. Finch said, it was, was Karen Lennox addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?  And essentially
 2
the evidence that you saw about this question kind of breaks
   137
 3
down into two issues.
 4
The first one is -- is whether the nicotine in
 5
cigarettes is addictive.  And then the second question is
 6
was Ms. Lennox addicted?  And you actually heard evidence
 7
about both of those.  Even though there's an Engle finding
 8
about the addictiveness of cigarettes, plaintiff put on
 9
evidence to try to show again on top of the finding that
cigarettes can be addictive, I told you in opening there
wasn't going to be any dispute about that.  The nicotine
that's in cigarettes can be addictive.  The evidence will
show that that's been known for at least a hundred years.
And the evidence showed that the industry even funded
researchers who published about that as far back as early
1960.  
Some of what you heard about the general
addictiveness about cigarettes might been interesting to
you.  It might have been something you heard about dopamine
receptors and all of those things that Dr. Werner was
talking about, but they don't answer the question for you
that really matters on this point, which is whether Karen
Lennox was addicted, because the evidence shows that not all
smokers are addicted.  
So what was the evidence that Ms. Lennox was 138
 1
addicted?  How did the plaintiff go about trying to meet
 2
their burden of proving that to you?  Well, let me tell you
 3
what it wasn't.  It wasn't the Governor of Florida.
 4
Mr. Finch must have talked about the Governor of Florida and
 5
Ms. Werner about five or six times.  The Governor didn't
 6
come in here and sit in the witness box and tell you that
 7
Ms. Lennox was addicted.  Neither did the Surgeon General.
 8
Neither did a lot of the other items that they put on their
 9
version of the verdict form.  The person who came in here
and told you that Ms. Lennox was addicted was their paid
expert, Dr. Werner.
And what did Dr. Werner actually say about
addiction and who's addicted.  Mr. Finch went on and on
about this quote from the Surgeon General's report that says
that nicotine is the fundamental reason that folks smoke.
And he showed it to you as if that's the reason that
everyone smokes.  Everyone smokes because of nicotine.  But
the evidence that you heard from their own Dr. Werner was a
little bit different than that.
Can I have the next slide?
At the top you see the quote that they showed you,
nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that
individuals persist.  That's the part that he showed you.
The part that Dr. Werner gave up freely in answering
questions to Ms. Patterson is that only about 50 percent of 139
 1
current daily smokers are addicted.  And Ms. Patterson asked
 2
her, well, how does that -- what does that mean for this
 3
quote about nicotine being the fundamental reason that
 4
people smoke?  Doesn't that mean that nicotine is only the
 5
fundamental reason that about half of current daily smokers
 6
smoke, and Dr. Werner agreed with that.
 7
Now, this Dr. Werner is also the witness that came
 8
in and said to you Ms. Lennox was addicted.  And how did she
 9
do that?  Well, one of the things that she used was a rigged
test.  And when I say a rigged test, I mean a test that's
rigged to only spit out one result.  She used a test called
the Fagerstrom Questionnaire.  And she agreed that the
Fagerstrom is a screening tool and that every single human
being who completes the Fagerstrom test is found to be
dependent or addicted.  That means that even if you've never
smoked a cigarette in your entire life, if you take the
Fagerstrom test, it will find that you're addicted to the
nicotine in cigarettes.
What does that mean?  What does that tell us about
this test?  What does that tell us about Dr. Werner?  It
means that once you've chosen to use the Fagerstrom test,
you've already chosen what you want the result to be,
because there is no other result of that test but a finding
of addiction.
Now, she did use some other tests too.  She used, 140
 1
and maybe we have a demo on this, the next one.  She used
 2
the CAGE criteria, I think she said it was called, and the
 3
DSM-V.  And she told you that you're not supposed to use
 4
these tests in a checklist fashion.  She said, I'm
 5
Dr. Werner, I've had all this training, I'm bringing all my
 6
medical expertise to bear, and I know how to do this and
 7
nobody can do this but medical doctors.  Then when she
 8
actually started using the test, it was nothing but a
 9
checklist.  Even when Mr. Finch showed you the CAGE
criteria, it was like four questions, one, two, three, four,
and there was a check box.  You ask a question and you check
a box.  That's it.  That is the extent of Dr. Werner's
analysis of whether or not Ms. Lennox was addicted and she
did these very same things for the DSM-V criteria.
What she didn't do, she didn't do what she does in
her practice.  If someone were to go see Dr. Werner and say,
hey, I've got these issues and I'm also a smoker, can you
help me quit smoking?  What would she do?  She would meet
with that person, she would look at them face-to-face and
she would ask them questions about their smoking behavior.
She didn't do that with Ms. Lennox.  Ms. Lennox is at her
home where she's been the entire time that Dr. Werner has
been involved in this case.  Dr. Werner could have gone and
met with her, talked to her, examined her, and figured out
whether she met criteria for addiction, and she didn't do 141
 1
that, because she wasn't interested in doing that.
 2
The test that she used when she testifies in court
 3
were going to spit out the same result regardless, addicted.
 4
And one last thing about addiction.  Mr. Finch
 5
said a couple of times that Ms. Lennox was addicted when she
 6
was 16 years old.  There is no evidence of that at all.  If
 7
you were to actually take even the checklist that Dr. Werner
 8
used and try to apply those checklists to Ms. Lennox when
 9
she was 16, the Fagerstrom, of course, will spit out the
answer that she's addicted.  The other ones can't be
answered.  The other tests for cigarette addiction that she
used depend on evaluating how someone responds when they try
to quit smoking.  But Ms. Lennox wasn't trying to quit
smoking anytime before 1997.
If they're going to persist in saying that
Ms. Lennox was addicted by the time she's 16, then they
should stand up and show you, go through the checklist if
they're going to use a checklist, show how those checklists
apply to Ms. Lennox when she was 16.  They won't do that,
because they don't.
Now, I'm not gonna spend much more time on
addiction, because, quite frankly, it's not the most
important issue on the verdict form for you to decide.  But,
yes, we do think that your answer to Question No. 1 would be
no.  By checking no you are answering the question that plaintiff didn't prove that she was addicted.  That's all
 2
I'm going to say about it, because I want to get to the next
 3
question, which is far more important than any question of
   142
 4
whether she was addicted.
 5
So this is Question No. 2:  Was addiction to
 6
cigarettes containing nicotine a legal cause of Karen
 7
Lennox's COPD?
 8
Why do I say this is so important?  You've heard a
 9
lot of evidence about addiction, but you've heard about
addiction as if it's one question.  All we have to do is
figure out whether she's addicted.  That's most of what
Mr. Finch talked about, it's most of what Mr. Pendell will
talk about if he talks about addiction after I sit down.
But the addiction issues are two separate questions that
appear separately on the verdict form.  That means that even
if you think that Ms. Lennox was addicted on the first
question, you still have to figure out whether addiction was
a legal cause of her COPD.
Can I have the next slide with the two boxes?
This is kind of a visual representation of what
I'm talking about.  Plaintiff does have to prove that
Ms. Lennox was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine,
but they also have to prove that addiction was a legal cause
of her COPD.  And that one they're also not going to be able
to do. 143
 1
Now, before we go to the next slide, I want to
 2
show you something and it's -- I have a slide that's
 3
actually kind of similar to one of the ones they showed you.
 4
They had a slide with some Winston cigarettes like on the
 5
left and then on the right they had I guess some -- they
 6
were like portions of the lung or something, a cull out of
 7
the lung, and in the middle they had what I guess was
 8
supposed to be a person, it was like one of those
 9
Pepto-Bismol ads where the body is turned like sideways and
you can see the path down into the body.  And they were
showing you that slide to suggest to you that -- that
smoking inevitably leads to -- I'm sorry, that nicotine
inevitably leads to smoking and that inevitably leads to
getting sick.  But that's just not true.
Can I have the next slide, please?
This is the true depiction of how this works.
Nicotine is on the left.  They say that's what makes people
smoke.  COPD is on the right.  That's what can result in
people who smoke cigarettes for a long, long time.  In
between the nicotine and the COPD is a human being.  And in
this case, that human being is Ms. Lennox.  Ms. Lennox is
and always has been a living, breathing, thinking, sentient
person who makes decisions that affect whether or not she
gets COPD or any other illness.
Ms. Lennox decides when or whether she's going to 144
 1
try to quit.  Ms. Lennox decided how she would try to quit.
 2
Ms. Lennox was the only person who could decide whether or
 3
not she would ask for help in quitting.  Ms. Lennox is the
 4
person who made the decision not to quit smoking in the
 5
'60s, the '70s, or the '80s or most of the '90s until 1997.
 6
And the question that you have to decide in
 7
answering the second question on the verdict form is whether
 8
addiction, even if you find that she was addicted, is that
 9
the reason that she smoked those years that led up to her
getting COPD.  And that's what I want to talk about now.
So what does legal cause mean?  The Judge will
give you some instructions about it.  They're pretty long.
And I've tried to reprint them all on this form.  You'll get
a copy of the Judge's instructions in a while.  But there's
a couple of words in here that really I think boil down to
what you ought to be looking for.
A legal cause is one that in natural and
continuous sequence produces or contributes substantially to
producing a certain result.
Right off the bat there's this requirement of
substantiality.  The plaintiff must show that she was
addicted and that her addiction directly and in natural
continuous sequence produced or contributed substantially to
her COPD, so it can reasonably be said that but for her
addiction her COPD would not have occurred. 145
 1
And then there's more language at the bottom that
 2
still ends up in the same place where it started.  You have
 3
to determine that addiction contributed substantially to
 4
producing Ms. Lennox's COPD.
 5
Now, why is that important?  It's important
 6
because we know the following things about addiction, even
 7
nicotine addiction.
 8
 9
Can I have the next slide?
We know -- and this came from their own expert,
Dr. Werner.  We know that everyone can make the decision to
try and quit smoking and that everyone can succeed in
quitting smoking, even addicted people.
Addiction does not prevent someone from quitting
smoking and of the 85 percent of smokers who -- who say that
they want to quit, only 35 percent will actually make an
attempt.
What does that mean?  That means that addiction
doesn't necessarily mean that you will smoke until you get a
smoking-related disease.  There are millions and millions of
people in this country who started off smoking, even became
addicted to cigarette smoking, but that person in the middle
made a different choice than Ms. Lennox made, they tried to
quit smoking and succeeded.
And even among people who were addicted, the
evidence is that there can be degrees of addiction.  Some 146
 1
people can be heavily, strongly addicted, where the
 2
addiction has such a strong grip on them that they can try
 3
over and over and over again to quit smoking and fail and
 4
fail and fail.  There are other people, even people who are
 5
addicted to cigarette smoking, who can try and quit smoking
 6
the first time they really put their mind to it.
 7
The question that you have to decide as to
 8
Ms. Lennox is whether or not her addiction, if you find that
 9
she had one, did it get in the way of her quitting?  Was she
smoking all of those years because the addiction stopped her
from quitting or is it because she wasn't trying to quit?
What about this -- 
Can I have the next slide, please?
-- the evidence was that in this country
60 million Americans have quit smoking.  And that there were
more -- there are more former smokers than there are current
smokers.  These are all people who have the same dopamine
reactions, the same nicotine receptors, many of the same
people who would be considered addicted under Dr. Werner's
Fagerstrom test, people who were exposed to same kinds of
cigarette ads that Dr. Kyriakoudes talked about.  And
nevertheless, the man or woman in the middle of nicotine and
illness chose to quit smoking.
Some of those people may have tried to quit
smoking and quit without difficulty.  Some of those 147
 1
60 million people may have experienced great difficulty in
 2
quitting, but they nevertheless quit.  What they all have in
 3
common is that all 60 million of those people decided they
 4
wanted to stop smoking and actually tried to quit smoking.
 5
So what was it, if anything, that's different
 6
about Ms. Lennox?  Did she lack the ability to quit smoking?
 7
Well, we know that can't be it, because she had the ability
 8
to stop smoking, because she did stop smoking.  The question
 9
is why is it that she didn't stop smoking earlier?  Why
didn't she stop smoking in time to avoid getting an illness
like COPD?  And the reason is she didn't try.  The evidence
in this case was that --
Can we have the next slide, please?
The evidence in this case is that Ms. Lennox did
what Ms. Lennox wanted to do and that if you don't want to
quit smoking, if you don't try to quit smoking, guess what?
You won't quit smoking.
The entire time leading up to the late 1980s or
early 1990s, if you believe plaintiff's theory about when
she got COPD, 100 percent of the time leading up to her
diagnose, whenever it was, she made zero efforts to quit.
And I don't mean -- you know, when we started off, there was
some back and forth on whether she tried to quit twice or
whether she tried to quit more than two times.  That was all
after she was already diagnosed with COPD.  If you look at 148
 1
the time period before she got her diagnosis, whenever that
 2
was, she admitted she made precisely zero attempts to quit
 3
smoking.  And again, the question you have to ask yourself
 4
on Question No. 2 is whether or not Ms. Lennox was smoking
 5
because she couldn't stop or because she wasn't trying to
 6
stop.  We believe the evidence is she didn't stop smoking
 7
because she wasn't trying.
 8
Now, in order to understand the choice that
 9
Ms. Lennox made, like I said in opening, we have to
understand Ms. Lennox.  Who was she?  I told you who I
thought the evidence was going to show that she was and then
you actually saw the evidence.
The evidence was that Karen -- as her sister said,
Karen did what Karen wanted to do.  The evidence about
Ms. Lennox is that she's -- as Mr. Finch said, she's
headstrong, she's not a follower, she is a go-getter, she's
feisty, she does what she wants to do.  She doesn't let
other people tell her what she's going to do with her life.
She's no nonsense.  She doesn't take any crap from
anybody.  Remember that, Ms. Patterson was talking to I
guess it was her daughter, Daylene, and she said, oh, she
doesn't take anything from anyone and her daughter, Daylene,
said, what do you mean, like stealing, like she doesn't take
somebody's personal belongings?  And then Ms. Patterson
said, no, you know, she doesn't take any crap from anybody, right?  And then when she put it that way, her daughter,
 2
Daylene, said, oh, you're right, she doesn't.  That's my
   149
 3
mother.
 4
She taught her daughter to take responsibility for
 5
her own actions and to do what she wanted to do and not just
 6
follow what other people wanted to do.  Even when it came to
 7
her own treatment.  Remember I had those exchanges with one
 8
of her medical doctors and I said to him, well, what is this
 9
pulmonary rehabilitation, is there a risk to it, is there
some downside to it?  He said, no, there's no downside,
there's no risk to it, it can only help you.
Ms. Lennox chose not to do that, because that's
the way that she lived her life.  And I'm not saying that to
criticize Ms. Lennox.  I would never do that.  The fact is
this is America and people can make those kinds of decisions
for themselves.  You can decide -- if you don't want to be
somebody who's working the same job for year after year
after year, you can choose, as Ms. Lennox did, to never be
on a job for more than a couple months.  If you don't want
pulmonary rehabilitation that your doctor tells you is going
to make your life better, that's going to improve your --
how you live with this condition, this is America, you don't
have to do that.  And that's the way she lived her life when
it came to cigarette smoking as well.
The fact of the matter is the evidence was clear 150
 1
and undisputed about this following thing:  Ms. Lennox
 2
smoked cigarettes because she enjoyed it.  She liked
 3
smoking.  Regardless of whether you or I or anyone else
 4
thinks that she should like smoking or thinks that maybe
 5
it's not good for her or wishes that she would have made a
 6
different choice, Ms. Lennox told you that she liked and
 7
enjoyed smoking.  She liked the taste of it.  She liked to
 8
relax with a cigarette after doing work in the yard.  She
 9
liked to sit on her porch with a cup of tea and a cigarette.
Even her sister, Diania, their very first witness,
said to you, yeah, I could tell by looking at her that
smoking was something that she enjoyed doing.  She wanted to
do it.
And this part is really, really important.  In
Ms. Lennox's mind, the health risks of cigarette smoking
were never a good enough reason for her to quit smoking.
You heard evidence that in the 1960s and 1970s, when the
Surgeon General's report came out and the warning labels
went on all the packages from 1966 forward, between 1964 and
1979, 30 million Americans quit smoking.
You also heard evidence that by the 1980s her own
family members were quitting smoking.  Her parents, her
sisters, other people in her family were all quitting
smoking.  That was never a good enough reason for Ms. Lennox
to quit smoking.  Then in the 1980s, early 1990s, her doctors are telling her, Ms. Lennox, it's not theoretical
 2
anymore, you have an illness that I, the doctor, am telling
 3
you was caused by cigarette smoking.  You need to quit
   151
 4
smoking.
 5
Ms. Lennox went another somewhere between six to
 6
eight years before she ever even thought about trying to
 7
quit smoking.
 8
She didn't tell you, when the doctor told me quit
 9
smoking, it can kill you, she didn't say, well, as soon as
he said that to me I had this epiphany and I started
quitting smoking, but, my God, the addiction was just too
strong, I couldn't quit.  She didn't say anything like that.
She gets this news and either sometime in the 1980s or, if
you believe Mr. Finch, in 1991, her doctors are telling her
you have to quit smoking.  And 1991 goes by, she tells you I
wanted to smoke, I didn't want to quit.  '92, I wanted to
smoke, I didn't want to quit.  That goes on year after year
after year.  She's not trying and failing, she's not trying.
In 1997, her husband becomes ill with cigarette
smoking.  She said it was hard to watch, it made an impact
on her, but that's not really why she quit.  I asked her.
You saw where I asked her the question and she said, no, no,
it was about my granddaughter.  It wasn't about health, it
was about me wanting to see my granddaughter.
And up until that point in time, up until she had 152
 1
that ultimatum about her granddaughter, she wasn't
 2
interested in quitting.  Just like we saw all of those
 3
medical records where she was offered pulmonary
 4
rehabilitation, record after record after record said she's
 5
not interested, that was her attitude about quitting smoking
 6
as well.  No interest at this time.  Absolutely refuses.
 7
Not willing to proceed with this, not interested in that.
 8
She's not ready for it.  Not interested.  Doesn't want it.
 9
Those are the same kinds of things she was telling her
doctors when they were advising her to quit smoking, at
least up until 1997 and the entire time before she was
diagnosed with COPD.
Even if you look at the way that she quit smoking
when she was ready, that tells you even more about this
question of -- the second question, addiction causation.
What happened when she finally quit smoking?  Ask
yourselves, as I described it, whether she did anything when
she finally quit that she could not have done at any earlier
point in her life.  What did she do?  She didn't do use some
prescription drug that was -- only went on the market in the
'80s or '90s.  She didn't use any of that.  She quit cold
turkey.  And she told you how she did it.  She separated
herself from her friends that smoked around her, which was
something she had never tried before.  She made a concerted
effort to stop and she stopped cold turkey.  Ms. Lennox, had 153
 1
she wanted to, could have done every single one of those
 2
things at any point in her life before then.
 3
Regardless of whether you think that she was
 4
addicted or even when you think she's addicted, if you think
 5
she's addicted, the thing that she did to quit starting
 6
sometime in 1997, she could have done those same things, for
 7
example, in the early 1980s when her family members wee
 8
quitting.  The fact is addiction is never what got in the
 9
way of Ms. Lennox stopping smoking.  Ms. Lennox is what got
in the way of Ms. Lennox stopping smoking.
Now, and that's --
Can we have the next slide?  
That's why the answer to this question should be
no.  But I want to give you an example.  I want to give you
an analogy that I think will help as you think about this.
And I'm going to assume, because we're on the second
question, I'm just going to assume that Ms. Lennox is
addicted.  Think of it this way:  Think of addiction as
being like faulty brakes on a car.  You take your car to the
mechanic, the mechanic works on your brakes, you leave
thinking your brakes are fine.  But in reality, your
mechanic didn't do a good job and your brakes aren't working
at all.
So you get out on the highway, wherever it is, I'm
not from here, you-all will have to forgive me, I don't know 154
 1
in it's 275 or I-4, someplace where you can just let loose
 2
with your car.  You put your foot on the pedal, you put the
 3
pedal to the medical, that car is speeding down the highway.
 4
Maybe your brakes aren't working, but you don't know it.
 5
And then you get into an accident.  And the whole way while
 6
you're driving that car before you got into that accident,
 7
you never put your foot on the brake.  Then, after you're in
 8
the accident, you decide you're going to sue the mechanic
 9
who worked on your brakes.
Did the mechanic cause the accident because the
brakes that you never stepped didn't work or was the
accident the result, was the accident legally caused by the
fact that you weren't putting your foot on the brake to
begin with?  You weren't trying to stop the car.
That's exactly the analogy that explains
Ms. Lennox's behavior.  Driving that car is the same as her
smoking cigarettes.  Dr. Werner said that if you're
addicted, especially if you're really addicted, it can make
it a lot harder for you to stop.  But until you put your
foot on the brake, addiction has nothing to do with it, in
the same way that faulty brakes had nothing to do with the
accident that I just described.
Now, the Judge is going to instruct you that if
you answer no to either the first or the second question, as
I've argued you should, your job is actually done.  There's 155
 1
no more questions on the verdict form that you have to
 2
answer if you answer no to either of these first two
 3
questions.  And what I would love to do is tell you that
 4
your job should be done.  In fact, I did just did tell you
 5
your job should be done at this point.  But it is my job to
 6
discuss the other questions on the verdict form, so I'm
 7
going to do that now.
 8
The next question on the verdict form is this one
 9
and this is one that Mr. Finch actually spent a lot of time
talking about:  Did Karen Lennox know or should she have
known through the exercise of reasonable care on or before
May 5th, 1990, that she had COPD and that there was a
reasonable possibility that her COPD was caused by cigarette
smoking?  And you know by now that COPD and emphysema are
basically the same disease.
I want to show you the Judge's instructions on
this, because I agree with Mr. Finch about one thing here.
The instructions on limitations are critically important.
And I think you should take as much time as you need to read
them, because they're going to be helpful to you, especially
on this one.
This is the first part of it:  Defendant has
raised a statute of limitations defense in this case.  It's
a provision of the law requiring that suit be commenced in
court in certain times of claims within a prescribed period 156
 1
of time, otherwise suit is barred or precluded.
 2
That means you can't have a claim, you can't be on
 3
notice that there's something wrong with you and just
 4
waiting around forever before bringing your case to court.
 5
In this case, plaintiff's suit would be barred if
 6
plaintiff knew or by the exercise of reasonable care should
 7
have known before May 5th, 1990, that she had COPD and that
 8
there was a reasonable possibility that her COPD was caused
 9
by cigarette smoking.  And we have the burden of proof on
this issue.
Next one, please.
Now, defendants do not need to prove that
plaintiff was actually diagnosed with COPD to prevail on
this defense.  For purposes of this defense, the critical
event is not when a disease or medical condition was
actually diagnosed by a physician, but when the disease or
medical condition first manifested itself.
Now, Mr. Finch spent a lot of time telling you
that manifestation doesn't matter, it's not the only thing
you have to decide, never mind that their expert said that
it manifested before May 5th, 1990.  Don't worry about
manifestation, it's not the issue, it's not a big deal.
Well, it may not be the only thing that you have to prove,
but this instruction tells you that it is the critical event
for this question that you have to answer.  Not when it was 157
 1
diagnosed, when it first manifested.
 2
Then it goes on to explain:  Plaintiff knew or
 3
should have known that there was a reasonable possibility
 4
that her COPD was caused by cigarette smoking if the injury
 5
manifested -- there's that word again -- itself to her in a
 6
way that supplied some evidence of a causal relationship to
 7
cigarette smoking.
 8
And you can consider what she knew about cigarette
 9
smoking before May 5th, 1990.
And let's have the last bit of it.
This is the third paragraph in this instruction:
With regard to the plaintiff's knowledge, you're instructed
that having the means to obtain knowledge is ordinarily
equivalent in law to knowledge.
If it appears from a preponderance of the evidence
that plaintiff had information that would normally have led
a reasonably careful person of the same age, mental
capacity, intelligence, training, and experience to make
inquiry through which such a person would surely learn
certain facts, then plaintiff may be found to have actual
knowledge of those facts, just as though she had made such
inquiry and actually learned those facts.
That's a lot of words right there.  What that one
boils down to is, if she had the information in front of her
to know something, the law treats it the same as her knowing 158
 1
it.  That's why the question that you answer on the verdict
 2
form says, knew or should have known.
 3
So what's the evidence about this one?  First part
 4
of it is, did she know or should she have known that she had
 5
COPD before May 5th, 1990?  There was a lot of evidence on
 6
this.  Lot of evidence that Mr. Finch didn't discuss with
 7
you.
 8
Well, the easiest place to go is Daylene.
 9
Daylene's testimony was that Ms. Lennox was diagnosed with
emphysema in 1987.  That was that passage from Daylene's
deposition that you-all probably were shown about 20 times.
Mr. Pendell and I went back and forth on it with their
pulmonologist, and then they even brought her in here and
she testified differently than what she said in her
deposition and Ms. Patterson had to show her that testimony
again.
Daylene's testimony was that when she was living
with her Aunt Diania when she was in elementary school for
six months, that's when Ms. Lennox went to the doctor sick
and short of breath and was diagnosed with emphysema.
Now, you saw the transcript where Daylene said, I
was born in '77, this was in elementary school.  That puts
it in '87 when she's about ten years old or so.  For some
reason they brought Daylene in here to tell you, no, no,
that was all wrong, I actually had no idea that my mother 159
 1
had emphysema until I was in my 20s.
 2
Well, what would that really mean?  When was
 3
Daylene in her 20s?  Well, she turned 20 years old in 1997.
 4
So that would mean that she first found out that her mother
 5
had emphysema sometime between 1997 and 2007?  Even under
 6
their theory of the case, her mother found out about her
 7
emphysema in 1991.  How could it be that Daylene went six,
 8
seven, eight years before she found out her mother had
 9
emphysema, that it was in her 20s?  That doesn't make sense.
What makes sense is that Ms. Lennox found out
about her emphysema, just like Daylene said when she was
under oath the first time, when they were living with Diania
in Miami and they went to the doctor and that's when she got
the diagnosis.
Then they showed you -- plaintiff's introduced
this one.  They showed you this Social Security record that
said, you know, they like one part of that record --
Do we have that record?  Can you pull that one up?
It's easier to find if you squint at this screen.
Okay.  So this is -- this is the record that they wanted to
show you, right?
No, that's not it.  Just go back to the last one,
please.
MR. FINCH:  6005PP.
MR. WALKER:  They showed you this record, we can't find it, I don't have it in my hand.  But this is the one
 2
where they said we like all this information in this record,
 3
starts off, great, it says, X, Y, and A.  And we like the
 4
end of the record too where it says these other things about
   160
 5
her not being hospitalized.
 6
The part of the record that they asked you to
 7
ignore is the part where in that phone conversation that led
 8
to that record Ms. Lennox told whoever was talking to her
 9
that she was in fact diagnosed with bronchitis and emphysema
before this 1991 time period.
Whoever wrote it down said that it was at age 17,
doesn't matter whether it was age 17 or 27.  What matters is
it was before May 5th, 1990.
That sentence is a little hard to read there.  She
was told at age 17 she has bronchitis, emphysema.
All right.  Can we go back to the other slide?
Now, so what about manifestation?  The critical
event isn't when it was diagnosed, but when it manifested.
That's the key question that Mr. Finch took me to task for
not bringing a witness, but why would I?  They paid the
witness to come in here to testify based on his expertise,
his training, his education.  He's the first person that
told you that because Ms. Lennox had severe COPD in 1991,
that doesn't happen overnight.  He told you that he knows
that by November of 1989, before May 5th, 1990, 161
 1
Ms. Lennox -- Ms. Lennox's COPD manifested.
 2
And then we had an exchange, well, what does that
 3
mean?  What does manifestation mean?  The Judge asked that
 4
question.  And he said, that means that it's diagnosable
 5
based on symptoms or testing or both.
 6
So I went back to him, I said, well, when you said
 7
that Ms. Lennox's COPD manifested back in '89, does that
 8
mean that Ms. Lennox's COPD was diagnosable on symptoms or
 9
testing or both?  And he said, yes.
And then we understood why he was saying that.
Well, what's the testing piece of it?  He agreed with me
that more likely than not, to a reasonable degree of medical
probability, Ms. Lennox's FEV-1 percentage was under
70 percent as of the first day of 1990, before the cutoff.
That means she had COPD.
We went through the symptoms that she had going
all the way back, that chronic productive cough that their
first witness, Diania, said she had for five years before
she went to the doctor, the shortness of breath that the
medical records show she had at least as far back as 1989,
the fact that she had trouble getting out of bed as far back
as 1989, the fact that she was unable to do things for
herself going back into the late 1980s.  Those are the mid
to late 1980 symptoms that Dr. Gravelyn was talking about
when he said that her COPD manifested in 1989. Then I said, well, what's the standard of care?
 2
Long-term smoker walks in the door to the doctor and says, I
 3
have a chronic productive cough, shortness of breath, I get
 4
tired on exertion, I have trouble getting out of bed, and I
   162
 5
can't do things for myself.
 6
And they showed you this chart back there that
 7
I've got facing the wall, all these other things that might
 8
be in the differential.  Well, we might think about all
 9
these things.  And I asked him, well, if somebody walks in
your door, they've got this cluster of symptoms, are you
going to figure out what it is, are you going to like, you
know, test that person and find out what's going on with
them?  And at first he fought with me.  He said, well, maybe
if you're an OB/GYN doctor you might not do that.
And I said, well, let's assume -- you know, let's
assume that she's smart enough -- I know there was a
suggestion that she's not smart.  Okay?  They use that
instruction to say to you that she's not smart, she's not
intelligent, she's -- apparently the argument on this
question is that Ms. Lennox was clueless.  But that's not
what the evidence was.  Ms. Lennox had enough sense to not
go to an OB/GYN doctor.  Any doctor that she went to would
have done precisely what Dr. Gravelyn said was the standard
of care.  There's no evidence that that didn't happen.
The standard of care allows you to infer that if she had gone to the doctor the way her daughter said that
 2
she did, she would have tested positive for COPD, just like
   163
 3
Dr. Gravelyn said she had.
 4
Now, next question:  Did she know or should she
 5
have known that there was a reasonable possibility -- 
 6
 7
Can I have the next slide?
-- a reasonable possibility that cigarettes were a
 8
possible cause of all of her symptoms of her COPD?
 9
What was the evidence about that?  Well, that too
came from Dr. Gravelyn and also from Dr. Montoya.  What was
the standard of care back in the late 1980s?  Was the
standard of care that somebody comes into your office, you
diagnose them with COPD, and you don't tell -- they're a
long-term smoker, you don't tell them cigarettes was the
cause?  He said, no, of course not.  The standard of care
then and now is if you have a patient who comes in who's a
long-time cigarette smoker, they have these symptoms and you
diagnose them with COPD, you tell them, your cigarette
smoking probably contributed to it.
Even if you diagnosed them with a different
injury, even if it could be just regular bronchitis, he said
you still tell them that it could have contributed to it.
If nothing else, you tell them that your cigarette smoking
might be aggravating your condition.  Even if you don't do
any of those things, the standard of care was to advise 164
 1
patients to quit smoking.
 2
All of those things would have put Ms. Lennox on
 3
notice that the symptoms she was having, the productive
 4
cough, the shortness of breath, the very things that her
 5
daughter, Daylene, said took her to see the doctor in the
 6
first place, there was a reasonable possibility that
 7
cigarette smoking was the cause.
 8
And if that wasn't enough, guess what?  It's right
 9
on the side of the packages that she was smoking.  Starting
in 1985 this warning label that we have here specifically
calls out emphysema as one of the things that cigarette
smoking can cause, the very thing that she was told in the
late 1980s that she had.
And we'll talk later about this idea that she
wouldn't have known what that meant, but let's just say this
for now:  This is what they say happened in 1991 when
Ms. Lennox went to the doctor.
She goes to the doctor, she brings her sister with
her.  Whatever questions she has about what the doctor is
telling her, her sister explained it to her.  Are they
really telling you now that when she went to the doctor in
the 1980s, like her daughter said that she did, with her
sister, that her sister refused to explain to her what
emphysema was?  Of course not.
Ms. Lennox isn't this mindless sheep that they want to make her out to be.  Regardless of what her reading
 2
level was, she knew how to get the information that she
 3
needed.  That's why she brought her sister.  Her sister was
 4
with her in the late 1980s, just like they say she was in
   165
 5
the 1990s.
 6
Now, so what does all of this mean?  Again,
 7
Dr. Gravelyn was our expert on this question.  They say we
 8
didn't call anybody, they got to him first.  He became a
 9
defense expert on this issue because he's testified about it
before.  It wasn't like it was this big surprise to us that
he would agree that if you have severe COPD in one year, it
means you had a manifestation of COPD two years prior,
because he gave that same testimony like just last year.
And so we went over with him these facts:  She had
severe COPD in '91.  That means it goes back two years, to
1989.  And it takes a long, long time to develop COPD
anyway.
Can I have the next one, please?
Then we said, well, you gave this opinion last
year, I just want to make sure there's nothing different
here than there was then when you gave this opinion.
Medical records first available on one day, at the time of
that date, there's wheezing, coughing, a productive cough,
shortness of breath, was -- I asked him, was the conclusion
in Berger any different than it should be here?  No, it's the same.  Manifestation two years before.  He agreed with
   166
 2
me right away.
 3
Then we looked at this chart.  Remember this one?
 4
So we have on here the green area is like the class period,
 5
you know, 1996 and earlier.  If it's too late, that's why
 6
it's red, you don't qualify.  If it's too early, if it's
 7
like to the left of May 5th, 1990, then you're checking no
 8
on Question 3.  So there's this green zone in the middle.
 9
And we know what --
MR. FINCH:  Objection, that's an incorrect
statement of the law.
THE COURT:  No.  Overruled.
MR. WALKER:  We know what he said in the Berger
case.  And can we just slide that same opinion over to apply
to Ms. Lennox.
The answer to Question 3 is no based on
Dr. Gravelyn's testimony.  They paid him, but his testimony
supports our defense.
Let me say this one additional things about this
issue too.  Mr. Finch made a lot about -- there was
something about Monday morning quarterbacking, like we were
somehow criticizing the doctors who prescribed the
medications that Ms. Lennox apparently was on in -- I guess
it was October of 1991.  We didn't do any such thing.
Ms. Lennox -- this is the sum total of the 167
 1
evidence on this issue:
 2
According to their witness, Dr. Gravelyn,
 3
Ms. Lennox had severe COPD when she went to the emergency
 4
room in September of 1991.  If some doctor there prescribed
 5
her something that she shouldn't have been prescribed
 6
because she had severe COPD, we're not the ones laying blame
 7
for that, they are.  They're the ones saying that she
 8
shouldn't have been given these medications for severe COPD
 9
when she had severe COPD.
But none of it matters, because regardless of what
she was prescribed or not prescribed in 1991, Dr. Gravelyn's
testimony remains the same.  She had severe COPD in 1991,
that means, to a reasonable degree of medical probability,
that if her COPD manifested, critical event, manifested two
years earlier as of November 1989.
And any doctor applying the standard of care that
she would have seen according to Daylene -- and even Diania,
Diania didn't say she went to the doctor in '90, she
couldn't remember when they went.  Any doctor that she would
have seen except maybe an OB/GYN, would have told her
something about smoking that put her on notice that there
was a reasonable possibility that cigarette smoking was
causing or contributing to her illness.
The answer to Question 3 is yeah.
Now, I want to move on to a different part of the 168
 1
verdict form.
 2
 3
Can we have the next one, please?
I have skipped -- you see I have Questions 4 and 6
 4
and I skipped over Questions 5 and 7, because those are the
 5
ones that have to do with like 1982 and all that.  You
 6
actually won't answer those questions if you answer no to
 7
these two and I'm going to take these two together to save
 8
time.
 9
Mr. Finch spent very little time trying to argue
to you that Ms. Lennox relied on something to her detriment
in this case.  There's a reason for that.  The reason is
this is a very usual case when it comes to the fraud.
Why do I say that?  Because you can only accept
their fraud allegations if you ignore the testimony of their
own witnesses.  You don't see that every day.
The very first witness that they called was
Ms. Lennox's sister, Diania, who said that Ms. Lennox didn't
read newspapers, didn't read magazines, specifically didn't
read some of these Life, Reader's Digest, didn't watch the
TV news, and didn't listen to the radio news.  That's
witness number one for the plaintiff.
Immediately after that, they called
Dr. Kyriakoudes, who starts off by telling you about this
machine and what was going on in the 1800s and early 1900s.
And immediately after that, he proceeded to tell you about all the ads and statements that ran in that same media that
 2
their first witness, Diania, told you Ms. Lennox wasn't
   169
 3
watching.
 4
Their first witness established that their second
 5
witness was almost entirely irrelevant.  He starts showing
 6
you ads for cigarettes that Ms. Lennox didn't smoke, ads
 7
like Chesterfield, ads that ran in magazines she didn't read
 8
like Life, ads in newspapers she didn't read, ads that ran
 9
before she was born.  There was even that one moment where
we had that one with like the 40 or 50 ads on it and I said,
well, why don't you show us, show us the Lucky Strike ads on
here.  You know, that was brand she smoked, show us the
Lucky Strike, and he was so proud to announce that he found
12 to 15 Lucky Strike ads.
I have circled them right here, Mr. Walker.  Until
I said, well, when did they run?  Oh, they all ran before
she was born or whether she was a baby.
Then he showed you ads and TV show sponsorships
that ran -- that aired on programs she didn't watch.  You
had to watch tobacco executive statements on TV news
programs that she didn't watch.  Right up to the very end,
even yesterday, we all had to sit and watch about 45 minutes
of TV news programming that Ms. Lennox had just testified
she didn't watch.
The evidence from Diania and Ms. Lennox was that 170
 1
she wasn't watching Nightline, but they were going to be
 2
sure that you saw it, 25 minutes of Nightline.  She wasn't
 3
watching Face the Nation, but they wanted you to see that
 4
too.  It has nothing to do with Ms. Lennox.
 5
And in fact, Dr. Kyriakoudes was on the stand for
 6
something like eight hours doing this.  Until I started my
 7
cross-examination and you found out in about the first three
 8
minutes of that that nothing that he talked about had
 9
anything to do with any question that you're going to answer
on this verdict form about Ms. Lennox.
And then at the end of the case, so it's Diania,
Dr. Kyriakoudes, then Ms. Lennox, and she tells you in no
mistaken terms that she wasn't interested in any of it.  I
asked her about news stories and I said, well, Ms. Lennox,
what if there was a news -- you told me you didn't watch the
news, I get that.  But you're a smoker.  What if there was a
news story about smoking?  What if there was a Senate
hearing about smoking, would you watch that?  That's
something you would watch?  She said, no, I wouldn't watch
that.
When I asked her about the Senate one, remember
what she did, Ms. Patterson had to take the stand and we
read this part of it.  What would she do if she was -- if
it's like something on a Senate hearing.  She said, click.
And I said, well, what is that?  That's the sound of me 171
 1
changing the channel.
 2
That means that this clip, maybe they'll show it
 3
again, that clip is playing just like it is now.  If she was
 4
actually watching this on TV, she would click the remote and
 5
turn it off.  She wasn't interested in that.  She wasn't
 6
watching it and she most certainly did not rely on it.
 7
They paid this Dr. Kyriakoudes over $10,000 to
 8
come here and to talk to you about everything but the only
 9
smoker whose name is on the verdict form.  He was only
interested in talking to you about what the American public
knew or the general public or at one point he even said,
well, really I'm just talking about a portion of the
American public.  But since he brought it up, we explored it
were him.  He talked to him about it.  You want to talk
about the American public, let's talk about the American
public.  And the evidence showed that the American people
were never these mindless sheep that he wants you to think
they were, they were duped into believing everything that
tobacco company executives said.
We showed you the evidence that at the times he
was talking about this conspiracy going on -- 
Can I have the next one, please?  
-- there were polls that were being conducted and
those polls showed that 90 percent, 90 percent, 90 percent,
92 percent, 94 percent, 94 percent of Americans believed, 172
 1
not was just aware, believed that cigarette smoking was
 2
harmful to their health.
 3
 4
Can I have the next one, please?
Then we said, well, what about the other side of
 5
the debate, what are the American people, since that's what
 6
you want to talk about, what are -- are they buying into
 7
stuff that you say the tobacco companies are selling?  And
 8
we look at the polling results for that.  Nobody, five
 9
percent at its highest, from three to five percent of people
from 1968 all the way up to the early 1980s, almost no one
said that the tobacco companies were a reliable source of
information on smoking and health.
Can we have the next slide, please?
What does that mean?  That means these clips on TV
that he wanted to show you that ran that Ms. Lennox wasn't
watching, even if she was watching, if she was like most
Americans, she paid no attention to it.
When this says that only five percent of the
people were listening to the tobacco companies and finding
them reliable, this is what this poll is talking about.
People like the people they showed you, Ann Browder,
Heimann, some random TI spokesperson walking down a bunch of
stairs, Ed Horrigan that we watched yesterday, Cullman,
Joseph Cullman that we watched yesterday.  Nobody was
relying on these people and certainly not Ms. Lennox. 173
 1
Now, how do people end up -- how does it come to
 2
pass that 90 percent or better of Americans believe that
 3
cigarette smoking was harmful to health?  I'm going to do
 4
this part really fast, because it's really not relevant to
 5
Ms. Lennox, but because they raised it.  
 6
 7
Can we have the next one.
Because it was all over the newspapers.  Cancer
 8
cause found in cigarette smoke.  U.S. strengthens cancer
 9
sigh, article after article after article in evidence
showing the other side that Dr. Kyriakoudes, even when he's
talking about the American public, didn't want you to see.
Next item, please.
Magazines, we didn't show this to you, because it
wasn't worth your time.  Ms. Lennox wasn't paying attention
to magazines.  But this is what was out there.
Next slide, please.
News coverage.  We didn't show you this, because
it's not worth your time, she wasn't paying attention to any
of this.  But there were people on the news, just give them
five or ten seconds of this.
(Video published to the Court and jury.)
MR. WALKER:  That's 1955.  America wasn't this
place where the tobacco companies had the stage and no one
else did, that there was no corresponding message.
Let me have the next slide, please.  Just go to 174
 1
the next one, please.
 2
Even in movies -- these are all in evidence.
 3
There are movies, like You Only Live Twice, James Bond,
 4
Smoky and the Bandit, Superman.  These are all in evidence,
 5
the video's there if you want to see them, where in popular
 6
culture people were talking about the health risks of
 7
cigarette smoking.
 8
 9
Can I have the next slide, please?
Same is true of addiction.  References to smoking
being addictive back to the early 1900s and this is a 1963
article that I mentioned just as one example of a published
statement about smoking being through -- smokers being true
addicts.  
Then I said to Dr. Kyriakoudes, well, do you have
a statement, any time up until 1988 where a tobacco person
said it's not addictive?  And he said, oh, yeah, I have
hundreds of those, I have lots of those, lots of those, I've
got 30 million documents back where I come from.  Well, did
you bring one?  What did he say?  I didn't have time to show
it.  Eight hours on the stand, I didn't have time to show it
to you.
Why did they do that in about two or three
minutes?  Because Ms. Lennox's testimony can't work one way
for them and a different way for us.
Mr. Finch's argument, and Mr. Pendell's when I sit 175
 1
down, their argument is that she didn't see any of this
 2
information that was out there that was causing 90 percent
 3
of Americans to say that cigarette smoking was harmful.  But
 4
apparently, according to them, she did see these statements
 5
that her own sister said she wasn't watching.  That doesn't
 6
make any sense.  The reality is Ms. Lennox wasn't watching
 7
any of it.  She wasn't looking at any statements of tobacco
 8
company executives and she wasn't looking at this stuff
 9
either that I just showed you.  And that's because none of
that was important to Ms. Lennox, she didn't pay any
attention to any of it.
What did she pay attention to?  What really
mattered for her?  What mattered to her was the fact that
her family smoked.  She didn't start smoking because of an
ad, she said she started smoking because her whole family
smoked.  That's where she got her first cigarette.
Her role models weren't celebrities or astronauts
or athletes or doctors or any of those things that
Dr. Kyriakoudes talked about with Mr. Finch.  Her role
models were her parents, not advertising.
And Dr. Kyriakoudes even admitted when I asked him
about it that those -- studies show those are the most
important factors for why people start smoking, not
advertising, whether or not their parents and siblings and
friends smoke and that's why Ms. Lennox started smoking. 176
 1
Let's be clear:  I am not trying to suggest to you
 2
that Ms. Lennox never saw an advertisement.  I'm not trying
 3
to suggest to you that she never saw any of those statements
 4
that they showed or that I showed.  It's not that she didn't
 5
see this information, it's that it wasn't important to her.
 6
She didn't rely on it, it didn't matter to her.
 7
But that is the question on the verdict form.  Did
 8
she rely to her detriment on a statement that RJ Reynolds's
 9
made that was false.
So what's the ad that they rely on?  Mr. Finch
said it.  They say, well, Winston, she remembered this
Winston jingle, she eventually smoked Winston cigarettes.
That's fraud.  That's got to be fraud.  She remembered the
slogan, she smoked it.  That's fraud.  That's their
argument.  That is the entirety of their argument about
Ms. Lennox relying.
So where is the fraud?  The ad, the statement that
they're referring to, is the one that says Winston tastes
good.  They say that Ms. Lennox tried that first package of
win because of an ad that said that it tastes good.  Okay.
Why did she smoke the second package of Winstons?
She told you, because the ad wasn't false.  The ad said
Winstons taste good.  She tasted them, concluded for herself
that they did taste good and she wanted to keep smoking
them. 177
 1
Ladies and gentlemen, that is not fraud.  A true
 2
statement that's being made about a product that she tries
 3
and agrees with is not fraud.
 4
And the interesting thing is, the overwhelming
 5
majority of the Winston ads had warning labels.
 6
Dr. Kyriakoudes agreed with me about that.  Most of them had
 7
warning labels.  The ones that didn't have warning labels,
 8
those are the one that Dr. Kyriakoudes decided you needed to
 9
see.  You need to see these ads in the minority without the
warning labels.  I said, why did you do that?  He didn't
have a good answer for that.
But that does bring us back to the question of the
warnings, whether they are in the ads or in the package?
What about this -- what about this allegation that they make
that Ms. Lennox, you know, she couldn't read, she's not able
to understand these warnings.  Well, let's go back.
Can I have the next one, please?
First of all, what other warnings are we talking
about?  Caution, cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your
health.
Next one, please.
Warning:  The Surgeon General has determined that
cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.
The next one, please?
Surgeon General's warning:  Smoking causes 178
 1
emphysema.  Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious
 2
risks to your health.
 3
These are the kinds of warnings that were on
 4
virtually every -- actually, every single package of Winston
 5
cigarettes that she smoked.  She started smoking Winston
 6
cigarettes in the late 1960s.  She never smoked a package of
 7
Winston that didn't have one of these warnings on it.
 8
Those warnings were established by Congress and
 9
the Judge's instruction tells you that we cannot be held
liable because they don't like what the warnings say.
Congress put those warning labels there.
Now, so at the beginning of the case, Mr. Pendell
tries to make it seems like, well, she couldn't read, she
couldn't read these warnings, she didn't -- yeah, it said
that there, but she didn't know what any of that meant.  And
then their own witness, they say we need to bring a witness,
their own witness, Dr. Werner, takes the stand and
Ms. Patterson's first few questions for her, maybe you can
clear this up, you reviewed everything, you talked to
Ms. Lennox, is there any problem, you're a trained
psychiatrist, you're -- you know, Mr. Finch would say, my
God, Governor, the Governor is behind Ms. Werner, okay?  
Dr. Werner said, of course she could read those
warning labels.  Of course she could understand those
warning labels. 179
 1
And you know from the evidence that if there was
 2
any point in time when Ms. Lennox could not on her own
 3
understand those warning labels, she could have asked her
 4
sister, Diania, or any other family member, they would have
 5
told her exactly what it meant.
 6
But you have to -- there's a credibility issue you
 7
have to decide here, because you saw it at the end of that
 8
video that we watched.  What did Ms. Lennox really say about
 9
the warnings?  It goes something like this:  I never saw
warning labels.  But if I did see them, I didn't understand
what they meant.  But if I did understand what they meant, I
didn't pay any attention to them.
You have to make up your own mind about what that
means, where is the truth from all of this?  I think the
truth in all of that and I think if you look at the evidence
you'll agree with me, the truth is only the very last
statement, she did see the warnings, she did know what they
meant, just like she knew what warnings on bug spray meant,
but she wasn't interested, she didn't pay any attention to
them.  It's not what was important to her and Karen did what
Karen wanted to do.  The fact of the matter is, it was never
the case that Ms. Lennox wasn't warned about the health
risks, it's just that she wasn't interested in that
information.
And there's no part of the fraud case that you saw 180
 1
during trial or heard about from Mr. Finch that made one wit
 2
of difference to Ms. Lennox.  None of it mattered to her,
 3
not the Frank Statement, not the Congressional hearing she
 4
changed the channel on, nothing.
 5
But asking the question of whether it mattered to
 6
Ms. Lennox is important for one other reason before I
 7
leave -- before I leave their fraud claim.  All during trial
 8
and again today and probably again after I sit down, they've
 9
been making this accusation that RJ Reynolds was marketing
to underaged people.  My God, they're going after the kids.
This is the accusation that they made.  And I told you in
opening we're going to talk about this.  Whoever they bring
to make this accusation, I'm going to ask them some
questions and you're going to see a few things about these
allegations that are going to show you that they don't have
the evidence to back that up.
And what did we hear?
Can I have -- you've already got it.
I first want to tell you at the top of the slide
it says, 1962, 1971, and you may have heard me in objections
or anything else asking about the timing.  Why does the
timing matter?  Because these are the only years that the
evidence even suggests that Ms. Lennox smoked as an
underaged person.  If she started at nine, that would be
1962.  She turned 18 in 1971.  Dr. Kyriakoudes agreed with me that you could sell, buy, advertise, market cigarettes to
   181
 2
18-year-old adults the entire time.  So where is the
 3
evidence that Reynolds or anybody else marketed to
 4
Ms. Lennox as an underaged person?
 5
They brought you five surveys:  1958, 1959, '72,
 6
'74, '84 'and '58.  They're all there.  I even gave you
 7
exhibit numbers in case anybody cares.  Every single one of
 8
those surveys I asked Dr. Kyriakoudes, I said, you've come
 9
all this way, the jury has heard this was going to be an
issue, show the jury the part of this document that says
that Reynolds was using this survey information to market to
underaged people.  Well, I -- I -- I -- he starts really
struggling to come up with an answer.  He couldn't show you
that in not even one of those documents.  His source for
saying that the company, that Reynolds, was marketing to
underaged people, his only source for that is
Dr. Kyriakoudes himself.  Remember he told you he's
impartial, so you can believe him.
Then he said, he said, well, these surveys,
they're elaborate, they're sophisticated, they're tobacco
companies bringing all their market research might to try to
understand what makes kids tick so they can market to them.
And I said, okay.  
This is the sum total of the surveys, the actual
surveys, that he showed you that are supposed to be this elaborate sophisticated market research program.  That's it.
   182
 2
This one page.  
 3
And then he quarreled with me.  I said, well, it's
 4
got three questions.  He said, no, it's not three questions,
 5
you've got to count the subparts.  Okay.  Then when I did
 6
that, he said, no, no, you have to look at the bottom of the
 7
page.  It's asking for, you know, gender and name and age.
 8
There was a suggestion that asking for the name means that
 9
they're going to like market -- this only went to -- this
was only -- they only did 400 of these.  Is the argument
that they were marketing to 400 high school students in -- I
guess this one was in, I don't know, sometime in the '50s,
outside of Florida.  That's their market?  That's their
proof of marketing to kids?
I challenged him to show you one passage in any of
these five surveys that said they were using the information
for that purpose.  He couldn't show you one.
Then I said, well, where is the market proposal?
Where is the draft, where is the market plan, where is the
document that you say you have?  You've got 30 million
documents, 85 million pages, where is it?  This is a court
of evidence.  Let's see it.  He comes in with this 1973
document.  Well, in 1973 Ms. Lennox is now 20 years old.
Okay?  And the document is a draft proposal.  It's a
proposal and it's not even final.  And then I said to him, 183
 1
well, what about this, it's a draft proposal about a new
 2
brand.  Haven't you testified before that that new brand was
 3
never implemented?  Oh, I said that before, but today I'm
 4
going to tell you that it was implemented in Camel
 5
cigarettes.  Now we're about back to talk about cigarette
 6
brands that Ms. Lennox never smoked.
 7
Five surveys, one draft proposal that was never
 8
adopted or was adopted from a brand she didn't smoke, zero
 9
marketing plans.  Not one.  Zero connection to Karen Lennox.
Can I have the next slide, please?
But even just in the few documents -- isn't it
amazing, even in the few documents they chose to bring, even
in just those few documents, I was able to point out to you
the places where Reynolds' actual policy was set forth.
That same '73 document we were just talking about, we should
not in any way influence nonsmokers to start smoking.
1984 document:  RJR's consistent policy is that
smoking is a matter of free informed adult choice, which the
company does not seek to influence.  This report is intended
to provide additional learning on younger adult smokers,
aged 18 to 24.
And that same document answered the question that
Mr. Finch tried to raise, why would anybody survey people
who were 16 or 17 years old if it's not to market to them.
The answer is in the documents they themselves showed.  In 184
 1
order to plan our business, you must consider the effects
 2
those choices, adult choices, have on the future of the
 3
industry.  They didn't prove youth marketing and they
 4
certainly didn't prove that it had anything to do with
 5
Ms. Lennox.
 6
The only other thing on this whole youth marketing
 7
topic I didn't mention, and I'll just say this quickly, they
 8
showed you the Flintstones, remember he came in and showed
 9
you the Flintstones?  But didn't tell you that Reynolds
pulled it's sponsorship before it went on Saturday morning.
Why wouldn't he tell you that?
Same thing with the Beverly Hillbillies, they
showed you the Beverly Hillbillies think like this -- now,
this is how we're trying to get -- then you find out the
minute they showed that people under a certain age are
watching Beverly Hillbillies, Reynolds pulled its
sponsorship of that too.  I said, Dr. Kyriakoudes, why
didn't you tell anybody that?  I wasn't asked.  That was his
answer.
At the end of the day, none of it matters, because
she didn't smoke because of any of this.  She smoked because
her family smoked.  And I'm going to say this one last thing
about this whole youth marketing issue, because Mr. Finch
said it today, he said it in jury selection.  It's not fair
to hold a nine-year-old, say that a nine-year-old is responsible their whole life for a decision they made at
   185
 2
nine years old.
 3
Well, that's because Ms. Lennox's lawyers want you
 4
to think that Ms. Lennox remained a nine-year-old girl her
 5
entire life.  She didn't, she grew up.  And while we don't
 6
hold underaged people responsible for the choices they make
 7
as children, we do hold adults responsible for the adult
 8
decisions they make as adults.  And that's particularly
 9
important here for the following reason -- 
Can I have the next slide please.
Look at this.  The 2010 Surgeon General's report
is in evidence and it says that you need 12.5 pack years to
be at an increased risk for COPD.  I asked Dr. Gravelyn
about it, he agreed with me that he's never seen somebody
with COPD caused by smoking where they didn't have eight
pack years.  Surgeon General says you need 12 pack years,
Dr. Gravelyn, their paid witness, says you need eight pack
years.  
So I let him do the math.  I said, Dr. Gravelyn,
let's look at Ms. Lennox's underaged smoking, let's
calculate the pack years of her underaged smoking.  It added
up to four pack years.
And then I said, well, if she had only smoked four
pack years, would she still have gotten COPD?  The answer
was no.  Then they came back and said, well, let's look at her adult smoking.  If you look at 18 years old up until the
 2
late '80s or early 1990s, was that enough to get COPD?  The
   186
 3
answer is yes.
 4
What does that mean?  What does that really mean?
 5
It means that Ms. Lennox's COPD did not come from her
 6
underaged smoking, it came from the choices that she made as
 7
an adult.  Over the age of 18 all the way up until her
 8
diagnose and beyond, she was making the same choices.
 9
The bottom line is none of these allegations about
marketing to youth, company statements, ads, none of that
has anything to do with what happened to Ms. Lennox and
that's why your answer on Questions 4 and 6 should be no.
All right.  Let's take a look at the next question
on the verdict form:  Please state the percentage of any
responsibility that you charge to each party for Karen
Lennox's COPD.
Now, you saw Ms. Lennox's testimony that in her
point of view she has no responsibility.  She played no role
in her smoking history according to her.  Maybe her lawyers
will tell you that she does accept responsibility, but not
for some of the claims.  She accepts responsibility for
some, but not others.
But, what are the choices that really could have
actually made a difference to Ms. Lennox?  It's not all that
stuff Dr. Kyriakoudes was talking about.  They're these choices:
 2
The choice to continue smoking into adulthood.  We
 3
just looked at it.  It was her adult smoking that caused her
   187
 4
COPD.
 5
 6
The choice not to even try to quit until '97.
The choice to quit cold turkey, as opposed to some
 7
other way.
 8
The choice of when to quit and the choice of how
 9
to quit.
Every single one of those choices could only be
made by Ms. Lennox.  Not Reynolds.  And for that reason, we
ask you to find that Ms. Lennox is 100 percent responsible
for those choices that only she could have made.
[#DELETED RECESS#]
MR. WALKER:  Thank you, Judge.
So we were looking at the eighth question on the
verdict form, which is the one about who's responsible for
Ms. Lennox's COPD and in what percentage.  And you can see
there that we think that zero percent should be put down for
Reynolds, because Reynolds didn't bear any responsibility
for the choices that actually mattered to Ms. Lennox.  Those
were choices that she had to make for herself.
In particular, if you really look at the timing of
it all -- 
Can we have the next slide?  Not that one.
If you just imagine the timeline of Ms. Lennox's
smoking, there's the time period from when she started,
that's on the left, and it goes all the way over to the 189
 1
right to the late 1980s if you accept what we say about
 2
manifestation or early 1990s if you believe the plaintiff.
 3
In any event, that is the period of time that leads up to
 4
her COPD diagnose, which we believe was in the late 1980s.
 5
And if you're trying to figure out what Ms. Lennox
 6
would have done had something else been said to her, if the
 7
companies had done something different that gave her more
 8
information, you don't really have to speculate about that,
 9
because we can look at the time period after that.  
Can we have the next one?
If we pick up where we left off, the late '80s,
and we go up to when she quit, now we know what Ms. Lennox
did when someone said to her in the most personal direct
powerful terms possible, you need to quit smoking or your
smoking could kill you.  She didn't try and fail, she didn't
try at all.  She did nothing and Reynolds is not responsible
for the choice to do nothing.
Now, let's take a look at the next question on the
verdict former.  This is Question No. 9.  I won't read the
whole thing.  This is a question about damages.  And you
already know from what I've said already I don't think you
should get this far into the verdict.  It won't come as any
surprise to you that we don't believe that this is a case
where damages should be awarded.  The Engle class has many
other smokers who have facts that fit Dr. Kyriakoudes' and 190
 1
other people's testimony, this just isn't one of them.
 2
The next question, however, is one I do want to
 3
spend a couple of minutes talking about.  That's
 4
Question 10.  Ten.  And this is the question about punitive
 5
damages.  And the reason why I want to talk with you a
 6
little bit about this one is because punitive damages
 7
sometimes is something we hear about, I want to make sure
 8
that we all understand the fundamentals and how it applies
 9
here.
What do you need to know about punitive damages in
a nutshell?  They can only be awarded for conduct that was a
legal cause of Ms. Lennox's COPD.  They are not an
opportunity for you to express unhappiness with something
that you think Reynolds did that doesn't apply to
Ms. Lennox.  Other people have cases where they can seek
their own punitive damages for what may have affected
someone else.  This case is only about Ms. Lennox.
Punitive damages can only be awarded to
Ms. Lennox.  You can't by your verdict, for example, say
that this amount of money should go to some health
organization.  That's just not -- any amount of money that's
awarded for punitive damages, and I'm -- you know, I can
give you a spoiler alert, I'm going to tell you that there
shouldn't be any.  But any amount that can be awarded can
only go to Ms. Lennox. And the last one is really, really important.
 2
Punitive damages by definition are damages that are in
 3
addition to the damages that fully compensate Ms. Lennox.  I
   191
 4
don't know why it says the Ms. Lennox.  But those are
 5
damages that they're asking for over and above full
 6
compensation.  It is basically just extra money.
 7
And punitive damages are only available to punish
 8
and deter.  To punish and deter.  Well, you heard from the
 9
stipulations that most of the people that you heard about in
this case, people like Dr. Teague and Dr. Heimann, most of
those people that you heard about or read about in the
documents, they've all passed away.  They're not here to be
punished and they're no longer doing anything at the company
to be deterred.  There's no need for that.
And you've already heard me go on at some length
about how none of what you heard about the company's conduct
actually caused any injury to Ms. Lennox.  But I want to
make an even further point.  A lot of the information you
heard about this case doesn't even rise to the level that
should be punished.  Let me give you some examples of not
reprehensible, not punishable conduct.
Can I have the next slide?
So it's not punishable conduct to hold the same
scientific view as people in the public health community
did. This isn't the one.  Can I have the other one,
   192
 2
please?
 3
This is one of the documents that they showed you
 4
from the early 1950s.  None of this has anything to do with
 5
Ms. Lennox, of course, this is just when she's being born.
 6
But this is their case for punitive damages and this was one
 7
of the documents they showed you:  The industry is strongly
 8
convinced that there is no sound scientific basis for the
 9
charges that have been made.
They believe that the more sensational accusations
in the recent papers were premature and, in some cases,
represent publicity issued in the hopes of attracting funds
and support for further research.
Why is that important?  Because Mr. Finch, and
Mr. Pendell when I sit down, are telling you this Claude
Teague at Reynolds concluded, he decided, that cigarette
smoking caused lung cancer.  Maybe he did.  We gave you the
evidence that at the time that he wrote what they were
relying on, he had just started with the company.  He was a
brand-new employee, fresh out of school with a new Ph.D., he
looked up a bunch of library resources that were publicly
available and he wrote a report that Dr. Kyriakoudes could
tell you was read by precisely no one.  It's only
Dr. Teague's opinion.  This is -- and Dr. Teague was not any
kind of executive in 1953, he was an entry level employee at 193
 1
Reynolds who didn't set any policy for the company.
 2
The people who were running the company in that
 3
same year, 1953, for better or for worse, this is what they
 4
believed:  They were strongly convinced that there was no
 5
sound scientific basis for the charges that had been made at
 6
that time.  And you didn't have to be a tobacco company
 7
executive to believe that.
 8
Can I have the next slide, please?  Maybe go back
 9
one.
Okay.  That same document points out that the
National Cancer Institute of the United States government
supported by Congressional appropriations also officially
refuted to tie up between cigarette smoking and cancer.  And
when I was talking with Dr. Kyriakoudes, he agreed with me
that at least in the 1950s John Heller, the director of the
National Cancer Institute, said that he didn't think that it
was proven.  And so did Cuyler Hammond at the American
Cancer Society.  This in the early 1950s and these are what
scientists were saying.
The document that I showed you about what the
industry strongly believed, that wasn't some press release
that was being put out to the public.  That was one of these
internal secret documents that they've been talking about
this whole trial.  When no one else was listening, when they
were there in private in this so-called secret meeting, they 194
 1
were saying that they didn't think that the link had been
 2
proven.  They didn't think there was a scientific basis for
 3
it in the early '50s.  And other people outside of the
 4
company's felt the same way.  A company should not be
 5
punished for having an opinion.  That should not be the
 6
basis for punishment, especially when, regardless of what
 7
the people in the company were saying to themselves
 8
internally questioning this link, by the 1960s.  As we
 9
looked at earlier, the '60s, '70s and '80s, forget about the
scientists, the public believed that cigarette smoking was
harmful to health.  So much so -- 
Can we have the next slide, please?
-- that we -- we talked about this quote with
Dr. Kyriakoudes.  This is in 1968, around the time that they
say Ms. Lennox started smoking.  You could stand on a
rooftop and shout smoking is dangerous at the top of your
lungs and you would not be telling anyone anything they did
not already know.
This Daniel Horn was from the United States
government.  This is now 15 years after the first document
where internally the companies were saying they questioned
the risks.
It's not punishable conduct to publish research on
cigarette smoking.  I showed you the green monitor, I held
up that big book, and then I put it down on the desk and it made kind of a thud.  That's the one that has 6,000 articles
 2
that was sent to the Surgeon General before the 1964 Surgeon
 3
General's report and cited by the Surgeon General.
 4
I showed you the NAP article on nicotine addiction
   195
 5
from 1963.  I talked with Dr. Kyriakoudes about how
 6
Dr. Rodgman at Reynolds was publishing on what was in
 7
cigarette smoke.  Before people knew why there were
 8
carcinogens in smoke, you had to invent the technology to
 9
figure out what was in smoke, and Dr. Rodgman at Reynolds
did that.
Those things are not deserving of punishment.
Reynolds shouldn't be punished for some of the things that
their employees might have said over the years that 20, 30,
or 40 years later some clever lawyers and their paid experts
can pull out and cherry pick and show you, well, this person
said this, look, this person said that.
There's not a person or corporation alive that if
you had -- if you had access to everything that person or
corporation has ever said that you can't find something that
will make that person or corporation look bad.  That's what
this case was here.  And Reynolds shouldn't be punished for
not publicizing risks that were already being publicized.
So the answer to this question -- 
Can I have the next one?
Whether by clear and convincing evidence punitive 196
 1
damages are warranted, the answer should be no.
 2
Do we have -- one thing I just -- to point out to
 3
you and then I'm actually nearly finished, is the reason
 4
that clear and convincing appears in red there is because
 5
that is a different higher standard of proof.  In civil
 6
cases the clear and convincing evidence standard is actually
 7
the highest standard of proof there is in civil law.
 8
And the Judge instructed you and you will see in
 9
the instructions that you have that to be clear and
convincing evidence the evidence has to be more compelling
and persuasive than evidence under the preponderance of the
evidence.  It's evidence that is precise, explicit, lacking
in confusion, and of such weight that it produces a firm
belief or conviction without hesitation about the matter in
issue.  You've got to be able to say that about their proof,
that Reynolds did something that harmed Ms. Lennox that's
deserving of punishment and they didn't meet their burden of
proof.  The answer to that question should be no.
Now, at the end of the day, the bottom line key
facts here are the same ones that I told you at the
beginning of my closing and the ones that I told you about
at the beginning of this case.  Ms. Lennox was a willing
smoker who smoked regardless of the risks.  She smoked
because she wasn't interested in quitting.  And then she
successfully quit when she finally was ready.  She wasn't 197
 1
misled.  Those are the key facts.  Those facts, plus
 2
everything else that I discussed, are what add up to a
 3
defense verdict in this case.
 4
Now, pretty soon you will begin your deliberations
 5
and I've tried the best I know how to summarize the evidence
 6
that you've heard and to give the defense perspective on it.
 7
When I sit down Mr. Pendell is going to have a chance to
 8
talk to you again.  I thought that I was going to be shorter
 9
than Mr. Finch, I don't think it worked out that way, but
they're going to have another crack at you to keep going.
And I don't get another turn.  It won't be like during the
trial where they stood up and say something and we have this
back and forth.  It doesn't work that way.  They have the
burden of proof, so they get to go last and I won't get to
speak to you again after they do.
But just the same, you've heard all of our
arguments, you've seen the evidence that we rely on.  As
Mr. Pendell is making his arguments, ask yourselves how I
might have responded to them based on the evidence that I've
talked about.
I want to express my appreciation one more time
for your patience and for your good humor.  As I mentioned,
I've explained this the best way that I know how and we are
now in your hands and I ask only that you follow the law,
use your common sense, pay close attention to the facts and to the facts that matter to Ms. Lennox.  And I ask you to
 2
return a verdict in favor of the defendant, RJ Reynolds
 3
Tobacco Company.  Thank you very much.
