simple straightforward questions.
Marchese know that smoking is dangerous, who was
in control of his decisions to smoke or quit
smoking, and did the Defendants do something wrong
that caused him to smoke, that caused him to get
sick?
And I told you the evidence would be that
he knew for decades that cigarette smoking was
dangerous and hard to quit, that he always had the
ability to quit smoking whenever he made up his

mind that he truly wanted to quit and was willing
to make an effort or efforts to quit, and that
nothing that the Defendants did or did not do,
said or did not say caused him to begin and
continue smoking.
So let's look at evidence.

there any doubt that this point she understood
that smoking could cause lung cancer and death.
Members of the jury, this was information
available not just to Sal Marchese, it was
available to all Americans, smokers and nonsmokers
alike.
It was up to every person to decide what
they were going to do with the information they
had, but since this case is about Sal Marchese,
let's talk about what he knew.
Let's talk about

She didn't want

It was a taper method
that took her six months to do it.
In closing argument, I believe Mr. Pendell

did Mr. Marchese know that smoking is dangerous?
What was the evidence?
overwhelming starting in 1950s, when Mr. Marchese
was in his 20s, he was on notice that smoking is
dangerous can cause cancer.
Throughout the 1950s
and 1960s, the evidence linking cigarette smoking
and lung cancer got stronger.
By the early 1960s,
the idea that smoking can be dangerous was no
longer an abstract concept, it wasn't something
that happened to someone else, it was something

that was happening to people who were very, very
close to him in his life.

What else happens?
The first warning went on the cigarette pack.
January 1, 1966.
You remember, I think it was
during Dr. Proctor, they put up a chart about how
many cigarettes did Mr. Marchese smoked in his
life, I thought had he stopped smoking in 1966,
how many of those would he have avoid?
Had he
stopped in 1973 or '74 with his wife, how many
would he have avoided?

about choice, and it's about responsibility.
Marchese had the opportunity to avoid continuing
to smoke, he made a choice to continue to smoke,
and, ultimately, you have to decide whether he has
responsibility for those choices.
By 1974, he knew and understood that
smoking was dangerous and could be hard to quit,
yet, according to Mrs. Marchese, he made
absolutely no effort whatsoever to quit smoking
for decades.
No effort whatsoever.

You don't need an expert to tell you this
is common sense, your experience every day in your
lives, the single most important factor in
determining whether someone is able to
successfully quit smoking is motivation and
persistence.
Simply put, unless and until the
smoker makes up his or her mind that they truly
want to quit, they are not going to quit.

I want you to think

or efforts to quit?
Mrs. Marchese, his wife, his best friend for
46 years who was with him every day of their life

first time that Mr. Marchese made any attempt,
made any effort whatsoever to quit smoking, was
sometime after 1993 when they moved from New York

that's inconsistent with what Mrs. Marchese
remembers, but, regardless, what we know is that
he didn't try to quit in the 50s, the 60s, or 70s,
and maybe if Ms. Irwin is right, he tried to quit
a couple times in the 80s.
So how did he try to quit?
Well, he would just wait a little bit longer

Mrs. Marchese estimated that he

You remember what Dr. Polsky told you?
He said, well, he offers all of his patients who

patients to decide whether to accept his advice.
Dr. Polsky said if a patient doesn't want to quit,
there is absolutely nothing he can do to make them
quit.
So I
Mr. Pendell says Sal Marchese didn't have
a choice or had no choice about nicotine getting
to his brain.
Well, I think Dr. Polsky would beg
to differ.
What Dr. Polsky said is it's up to the
patient to decide whether they want to quit, that
a patient has to be motivated and without

Well,
Dr. Proctor told you that in 1954, years
after Mr. Marchese already started smoking, the
Defendants entered into a 50-year conspiracy to
deny the health risks of smoking.
obviously, no conspiracy caused him to start
smoking because he was already smoking.
Basically, Proctor told you that the companies
conspired to create doubt about whether smoking
causes cancer and disease, and he showed you some
clips where spokespeople for the company said we
don't know, maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
He
showed you snippets from some documents and he
argued, okay, the companies really know it's
addictive and causes disease, but they never told
the public.
But here's the deal:
For purposes of this
lawsuit, it doesn't matter whether the companies
conspired to hide the health risks unless
Plaintiff shows that Mr. Marchese was somehow
misled.
Now, don't get me wrong, I am not asking
you to approve of the tobacco companies or their
conduct, I'm not asking to like them, I'm not
asking you to ignore the evidence, but this is a

law, if the actions of the Defendants did not harm

Let me say the evidence is clear that

Of course he's a good witness, he

Finally, at one point, I finally said, Dr.
What did he say?
Proctor, let's just be honest here, you think
cigarettes should be outlawed, they should be
abolished.
I
said, hey, Dr. Proctor, you don't believe that
adults in this country should be permitted to
decide for themselves whether to smoke?
You
remember he said the oddest thing, he said, well,
He said yes.

if you want to grow it in your backyard, that's
fine, but you shouldn't sell them.
Think about
that.
Every state in this union has made the
decision that cigarettes are a legal product and
that adults in this country are free to choose
whether to buy them.
That is a choice that we
Dr.
have made collectively as a free society.
Werner told you, I asked her -- Dr. Werner told
you that she believes that adults have the right
to make that choice for themselves.
When I asked
Mr. Marchese if she thought it was up to her
husband to decide whether to smoke or not, Mrs.
Marchese said I believe it's an individual choice.
That's what most of us believe.

But set that all to the side and let me
tell you about what I think is the most important
point about Dr. Proctor and his testimony.
I did
it right from the beginning because I knew that
examination going on for a while, I wasn't
necessarily going to have a lot of clean answers,
but I said first four questions, these are the
first four questions I asked Dr. Proctor.
I said,
"Dr. Proctor, you know basically nothing about Mr.
Marchese, right?
He goes, "That's right."
I said, "If the jury wants to know whether
when Mr. Marchese started smoking or why he
started smoking, you're not the person to ask?"
He said, "That's right."
I said, "If the jury wants to know what
Mr. Marchese knew about the risks and whether he
was addicted, you have no idea?"
right" again.
He said, "That's

"And if the jury wants to know whether Mr.
Marchese wanted to quit or ever tried to quit,
you're not the guy to tell them?"
right out of the box all of that is true.
And he admitted
Dr. Proctor, by his own admission, knows
nothing about Sal Marchese and that is critically
important in this case because you're being asked
to award Mrs. Marchese for her husband's decisions
to begin and continue smoking, and you can't
answer those questions unless you know why Mr.
Marchese smoked and why he didn't quit.
And the
simple fact is Dr. Proctor told you that he can't
help you answer any of those questions.
case.
So let's turn to the verdict form in this
Let just -- can we go to the ELMO?
So the first question is, "Was Salvatore
Marchese addicted to cigarettes containing
nicotine and, if so, was his addiction a legal
That's the first question,
cause of his COPD?"
that's the class membership question.
And there
are really three questions you'll have to decide.
The first question is was Sal Marchese, in
fact, addicted to nicotine, if so, was his
addiction a legal cause of his continued smoking
and did that cause him to get COPD?
Third, did he

03:40
03:40
03:40
03:40 03:41 03:42
03:42 4075
So there are three things
And it's
And if
actually have COPD?
you're being asked in that question.
Plaintiff's burden to prove all three.
Plaintiff doesn't meet her burden of proving any
one of those three, the answer is no and the case
is over.
Let's talk about the word "addiction."
Was Sal Marchese addicted to nicotine in
cigarettes?
Well, Judge Murphy read you the jury
instructions and he's going to read you at least
one more after closing arguments are done, but
when you look at the jury instructions, what
you'll find is there's nothing in the instructions
that defines addiction for you.
That's something
you have to decide for yourselves.
You've heard that the definition of
Dr. Proctor told
addiction has changed over time.
you that the word "addiction" has basically lost
its meaning.
Dr. Werner said, and I wrote this
down, "There is no uniform definition of addiction
that is accepted by the medical community."
Until
1988, you heard, the Surgeon General said
cigarette smoking was not addictive because it's
not intoxicating.
In 1988, the Surgeon General
adopted a different definition and said it is 03:42
03:42
03:42
03:42
03:42
03:42
03:42
03:42
03:42
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43 addicting.

Here was probably something that surprised
Both Dr. Werner and Kaplan told you that you
And I asked them about that because a lot
you.
cannot diagnose a person as addicted simply
because they smoked a lot of cigarettes for a long
time.
of people think, I mean, if you smoked two packs a
Both
day for 20 years, of course you're addicted.
Kaplan and Werner told you that's not so.
So they
both applied the DSM-V to the information they had
about Mr. Marchese to reach their opinions and Dr.
Werner testified she believes under DSM-V, Mr.
Marchese was addicted.
Let me digress for a second.
The CAGE and
Fagerstrom surveys, Dr. Werner told you that those
don't diagnose addiction.
Those are rough surveys
for general practice doctors, they're an
assessment of essentially the amount you smoke.
She told you that psychiatrists like herself do
not diagnose addiction based on CAGE or
Fagerstrom.
Instead, she, like Dr. Kaplan, uses
the DSM-V, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
V.
So what Dr. Werner said, she looks at all the
information that was available and she said that
before he tried to quit, whether it's the 90s or
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:43
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44 4077
the 80s, before he tried to quit, he would have
met five or six criteria and after he tried to
quit, he would have met six or seven.
Kaplan told you that he thought he met
four criteria, but he did not see any evidence of
clinically significant impairment or distress, so
he doesn't believe that Mr. Marchese met the
requirements.
But they both said, unequivocally, that
like all smokers, Mr. Marchese had the ability to
quit smoking when and if he was sufficiently
motivated to quit and he made a sincere effort or
efforts to quit.
Frankly, if you really think about Kaplan
and Werner's testimony, look at your notes, but
for their conclusion, they weren't that far apart
in terms of their analysis and what they said and
what they relied upon.
They said DSM-V is not a
cookbook, they said that different positions can
apply differently, depending whether you give him
one or don't give him one, you can reach different
conclusions.
Now, on cross examination, Mr. Oliver made
a big deal about the number of cases where Dr.
Kaplan has testified that, in his opinion, the
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44
03:44 03:45
03:45
03:45
03:45
03:45
03:45
03:45
03:45
03:45
03:45 4078
Well, is that a surprise
smoker was not addicted.
to anyone?
So if one of the issues in the case is
whether the smoker is addicted and you take a file
to Dr. Kaplan and you say what do you think, is
the person addicted?
Well, chances are you're not
going to call him, right, because he says, well, I
think he's addicted, so is that a surprise?
Werner said the same thing.
Dr.
I didn't go through the whole list of her
questions, but I asked Dr. Werner, "Dr. Werner,
you testified in 20 trials, right?"
"Yeah."
And she said,
I said, "Have you ever, ever testified in
And she goes, "No," and she said,
trial or deposition that the smoker was not
addicted?"
"Because when I look at a file, when a Plaintiff's
lawyer brings me the file, if I tell them I don't
think this guy was addicted, they don't call me to
testify."
So I just wanted -- it was a big deal, it
took a bunch of time and went through 19 or
20 cases, but Dr. Werner said the same thing, just
on the other side of the coin.
So here's the bottom line:
Whatever
definition you choose, I'm not sure it matters
03:45
03:45 03:46
03:46
03:46
03:46
03:46
03:46
03:46
03:46
03:46
03:47 4079
much whether Mr. Marchese was, in fact, addicted
because Plaintiff has to prove more.
Plaintiff
has to prove that addiction was a legal cause of
Mr. Marchese's COPD or he's not a class member.
You'll read in the instruction the definition of
what legal cause is, but I want to give you an
example.
And we talked about this a little bit in
opening, but I used a different example.
The law
makes the distinction between something that is a
cause in fact of an injury and something that's a
legal cause.

some of the records say a couple months.
Drs. Werner and Kaplan told you that, after a
couple of days, all the nicotine was out of Mr.
And, of course, Mr. Marchese

didn't smoke while he was in the hospital.
I
think it's pretty well accepted that he didn't
smoke for a couple of months.
Both Kaplan and Werner told you that after
a couple of weeks, any withdrawal symptoms he may
have had had passed.
Both Kaplan and Werner told
you that, after a month to six weeks, those
nicotine receptors that had up regulated had down
regulated and that his brain had gone back to
normal.
When Mr. Marchese left the hospital after
that 2-month period, and I was very careful to be
clear with Dr. Werner because I didn't want to
conflate two concepts.
I got her -- and she said

So let's talk about COPD.
In order to be
a member of the Engle class, Plaintiff has to
prove that on or before November 21, 1996 Mr.

You know what the simple

question:
answer is?
And why don't we know?
Because the evidence is lacking and what evidence
there is is inconsistent.
Now, Dr. Gravelyn came, he told you that
his opinion Mr. Marchese was diagnosed with COPD
in 1995.
Gravelyn
said that he would never in his practice diagnose
a patient without a PFT and it's undisputed there
are no PFTs.
You know what else he said?
So think about that.
Gravelyn is willing
to diagnose Mr. Marchese in this courtroom using a
methodology he would never, ever, ever use in his
practice.
That in itself is kind of remarkable,
isn't it?
So what evidence is there?
You saw the

doesn't know when he wrote down the word COPD
whether it was an actual diagnosis or a
provisional diagnosis.
Now let me tell you something so there's
no confusion.
If you think somebody has symptoms

03:55
03:55

03:55 03:56 03:56
03:57
03:57
03:57
03:57 4086
and you want to check him out, it is not fraud to
check a box and do the testing.
Don't you think
if you go in to see your doctor, the doctor thinks
you may have COPD, I want to do testing and they
check the box and they do it, and he goes, guess
what, you don't.
You're happy, you're relieved.
That's not fraud, but you have to put down a
provisional diagnosis for a reason to perform the
test so the insurance company will pay for it.
You also saw a billing receipt from Dr.
Norensberg's office, two boxes were checked, heart
disease and COPD, but, again, there's no evidence
of a PFT or any sort of pulmonary test being

receipt, it has a place for diagnosis of symptoms
and nothing is written down.
filling that out while he was seeing the patient,
why wouldn't he write down the symptoms and the
diagnosis as opposed to checking boxes for tests?
If Norensberg was
You know, Mrs. Marchese's testimony was
confusing and that's not surprising, it wasn't
intentional; we are talking about things that

You never get

understands that.
All right.
I want to make sure that everyone
So let's talk about this case.
How do you answer this question?
evidence is clear since the 1960s Mr. Marchese
understood smoking was dangerous and caused
disease and death and he didn't try to quit.
Well, the
The evidence is clear since the 1970s when
Mrs. Marchese quit smoking that Mr. Marchese
04:04
04:04
04:04
04:04
04:04
04:04
04:04
04:04 04:05 04:05
04:05 4092
understood smoking was hard to quit yet, for
decades, he made no effort whatsoever.
I already
talked about that; frankly, there's not much more
to say.
But let me say one thing that's important:
I want you to think back to opening statement.
Mr. Oliver said in opening statement that while
Mrs. Marchese may not think that Sal is to blame,
that on her behalf, they have taken the position
and they admit that Mr. Marchese bears some
responsibility for his decision to smoke and the
Plaintiff accepts some fault in this case.
In
They didn't say that in closing.
closing, he said Defendants deserve the lion's
share, so that suggests they are suggesting that
Plaintiff gets some responsibility, but Mr. Oliver
told you in opening statement that the Plaintiff
accepts some fault.
So I want you to think about what that
It could only mean, it could only mean
means.
that Plaintiff admits that Mr. Marchese understood
the risks of smoking and had the ability to quit
and had the ability to quit in time to avoid his
risk or how could he have any fault?
I want you
to think about that.
04:05
04:05 04:06
04:06
04:06
04:06
04:06
04:06
04:06
04:06
04:06
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07 4093
If Plaintiff admits, as Mr. Oliver said in
opening statement, that Mr. Marchese has some
responsibility, he can only have responsibility if
he understood the risks and he had the ability to
quit in time to avoid getting sick.
And if you
believe that's true, then you should write down
100 percent for Sal Marchese because they admitted
he could have avoided his injuries and only Mr.
Marchese was in a position to do that.
Let's go to the fraud questions.
Again,
if you answer yes to either 5 or 6, comparative
fault is out the window no matter what you decide
in terms of how responsibilities should be
allocated.
So this question, did Salvatore
Marchese reasonably rely to his detriment on any
statement of material fact made by each Defendant
that concealed or omitted material information not
otherwise known or available to him concerning the
health effects or addictive nature of smoking
cigarettes and, if so, was the concealment a legal
cause of Sal Marchese's death.
That's a mouthful.
That is a long question; that's a mouthful, so
let's kind of break it down.
So what does Plaintiff have to prove?
Mr. Oliver said it very succinctly, did Mr.
And
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:07
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08
04:08 4094
Marchese rely, but on what?
Plaintiff has to
prove that her husband reasonably relied on a
statement, on a statement, that concealed or
otherwise omitted material information not
otherwise known to him concerning the health
effects or addictive nature.
So here's the question:
What was the
What do they claim was the statement?
statement?
Plaintiff did not point to a single statement that
her husband ever heard about smoking and health.
I asked her, I said, Mrs. Marchese, have
you ever heard the of the Council for Tobacco
Research.
She said nope.
Did you ever discuss that with your
husband?
No.
Did you ever hear of the Tobacco
Institute?
No.
Tobacco Industry Research Council?
No --
or Committee.
No.
Did you discuss any of those organizations
with your husband?
No.
Mrs. Marchese, can you think of any
statement you ever heard from Philip Morris or
R.J. Reynolds about the risks of smoking?
No.
Do you recall hearing any statement from a

04:08

04:09
04:09

04:09
04:09
04:09
04:09
04:09 4095
tobacco company about the risks of smoking?
So what Mr. Oliver said, well, it was
No.
Let's talk about causes of causes,
Well, how about all the people
Wouldn't -- if
advertising.
it's advertising.
who saw the ads that didn't smoke?
that's the cause of causes, wouldn't that cause
those people to smoke, too?
With respect to cigarettes, Mrs. Marchese
said she never discussed cigarettes with Mr.
Marchese and she doesn't know why he smoked the
brands he smoked or why he smoked filters, but Mr.
Oliver said, well, he smoked Marlboro because of
the ads.
Marlboro ads.
Right, it was the Marlboro Man, the
Mrs. Marchese didn't say that.
Well, let me tell you another possible
He switched from

explanation for why he smoked Marlboro; that was
the brand his wife smoked.
unfiltered Lucky's to filtered Marlboros and that
was the brand his wife smoked.
equally likely explanation as to why he chose that
brand?
because he thought they were safer because their
position is that he doesn't know smoking was
dangerous, so if he doesn't know smoking was
dangerous, why would you switch to a safer
He said, well, he switched to filters
04:09 04:10 04:10 04:11 4096

was unsafe.
He didn't think the other cigarette
And Mrs. Marchese, I specifically asked
her, did he ever tell you why he smoked filters?
No.
Did he ever tell you why he smoked
Marlboro?
No.
Did you ever have a conversation about why
he smoked Marlboro?
No.
But here's the other thing:
How could he

Statement.
heard of the Frank Statement?
I asked Mrs. Marchese, have you ever
Heard about the Frank
She said no.
Ever discussed it with your husband?
The simple fact is Plaintiff did not
No. 04:11 04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12 4097
testify about anything that Mr. Marchese ever
heard or read from a cigarette company.
And if he
didn't hear it, or he didn't read it, he could not
have relied on it reasonably or otherwise.
But the fact is, members of the jury,
there is no evidence whatsoever that Mr. Marchese
was ever confused about the risks of smoking or
that he was waiting for the tobacco companies to
tell him something.
He personally understood
smoking caused disease; it was hard to quit.
And, finally, in order to recover under
this, even if you get past all that, Plaintiff has
to prove that her husband had not heard the
statement, whatever it was, he would have quit
smoking and would not have gotten sick.
Pendell told you he couldn't quit.
it.
He couldn't do
But Mr.
So think about that.
They are saying,
well, if there was something that he said, we
don't know what it was, but if there was, then
that made a difference, and if you wouldn't have
said it, he wouldn't have gotten sick because he
would have quit even though we are telling the
jury he couldn't quit.
So I'm telling you, the evidence is
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12
04:12 04:13
04:13

04:13
04:13
04:13
04:13
04:13
04:13 4098
And just like Mr. Oliver said, as it goes
overwhelming that the answer to question 5 is no
and no.
to question 5, goes question 6.
So now we are at damages.
How much time do I have, your Honor, do
you know?
THE COURT:
You have 7 minutes, counsel --
excuse me, I apologize.

That's the 5-minute
You have 12 minutes.
MR. COFER:

I'll be done by then.
So, if you get this far,
I can't.
You met Mrs. Marchese,

she lost her husband, she lost her best friend.
And if you decide that she's entitled to recover,
you're going to have to rely on your own judgment
to decide what's a fair and appropriate amount.

He said it's $50,000 a year.
MR. OLIVER:

MR. COFER:
Overruled.
It would take 220 years.
It
would take the average family 220 years to earn
the amount of money that Mr. Oliver is asking you
to award his client.
But you know what, you decide, if you get
this far, you decide what you think is fair and
you decide what you think is appropriate.
So let me get to the last topic and that's
punitive damages, so this is -- that's just up to
you.
I'm just taking a pass.
All right.
So punitive damages, please

punitive damages.
The fact
You've heard about the Engle findings.
The Engle findings alone cannot be a basis for
liability.
Again, that is in the verdict form.
The Engle jury heard nothing about Sal Marchese.
They know absolutely nothing about him at all.
The evidence was and is that Mr. Marchese always
had the information he needed to make an informed
decision to quit, that just like the 60 million
people that have quit, he had the ability to quit
if and when he decided he was willing to make an
effort to quit.
Dr. Proctor spent two days talking about
the culture of cigarette smoking but admitted he
doesn't know anything about Sal Marchese, and he
never showed you one document, he never showed you
one snippet that he tied to Mr. Marchese or any of
his decisions.

MR. COFER:
In terms of deterrence, the purpose of

of deterrence, what have we learned?
learned that the companies no longer advertise on
billboards or public transit or stadiums, and they
You learned that the Philip
haven't for 17 years.
Morris voluntarily stopped advertising in
magazines a decade ago.
Philip Morris and Reynolds have both had websites
that specifically say smoking causes cancer,
smoking is addictive, there's no such thing as a
safe cigarette, and they have links that say if
you want information about smoking, you can click
on our link, it will take you to the Surgeon
General's, it will take you to the National Cancer
Institute, take you to NIDA.
For the last 15 years,
Since 2009, companies have been subject to
extensive FDA regulation, and Proctor told you
that smoking rates, and specifically youth smoking
rates, are lower than they have ever been in our
nation's history.
The fact is that Philip Morris is a much
different company now than it was and I 04:20

04:21
04:21
04:21
04:21
04:21
04:21 4104
respectfully suggest to you that Philip Morris --
I'm sorry, that the Plaintiff has not met her
burden of proving that punitive damages are
appropriate in this case and that you should, if
you get this far, you should say no.
Okay.
So what's this case about?
You
know I told you in opening statement that this
case is about one smoker, whether he was a member
of the Engle class and whether Mrs. Marchese is
entitled to recover money for his decisions to
begin and continue smoking.
I told you it's a
case about Sal Marchese and what he knew about the
risks of smoking and what he did with that
information and why he chose to continue to smoke.
I told you the evidence would be that Mr. Marchese
knew for decades smoking was dangerous and that
Mr. Marchese always had the ability to quit
whenever he made an effort to quit, and that
nothing the companies did or did not do, say or
did not say, caused him to begin or continue
smoking, and I believe we've delivered on that.
You know, I want to say one thing.
You've
seen Mrs. Marchese, you met her family and you
know that she lost her husband and her best friend
and it is natural to feel sympathy in that
04:21
04:21

But the law and
you're instructed that your decision can't be
based on sympathy.
you took an oath that your verdict must be based
on the law and the evidence that you've heard in
this courtroom for the last couple weeks.
Your verdict -- and
It can't.
Now, back in jury selection, I told you
that all we really wanted, I told you there are
two sides to every story and all we wanted was a
fair shot to tell our side of the story.
I know
you've given that to us and I want to tell you how
much we appreciate it.
And I also told you in jury selection, and
this is true no matter what you decide, we have
the greatest system civil justice the world has
ever known.
It is the envy of the world and it
has been for hundreds of years.
And the reason why we have such a great
system of justice is because men and women like
you who are willing to take time out of your lives
and to sit here in court and put up with all the
lawyers and all of our nonsense, all the delays
and all that stuff, to help parties resolve
disputes that they couldn't resolve on their own.

On behalf of my client, I think on behalf
of everyone who has been in front of you for the
last two weeks, thank you very, very much for your
service and thank you for your attention; we
appreciate it very much.


MR. ISASI:
Thank you.
May it please the
Court, Mrs. Marchese and counsel, good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
We are going to move quickly here, I
promise you; I know I'm standing between you and
the door.
But after everything that's been said,
there are three undisputed facts, three, that
really give you all the information you need to
answer the questions in this case.
The first, the first fact is that in the
1960s, due to smoking-related illnesses that were
04:29
04:29
04:29
04:29
04:29
04:29 04:30 04:30
04:30 4108
occurring in the Marchese family, the Marchese
household, Mr. and Mrs. Marchese, they were fully
aware that there were health risks associated with
smoking.
Fact number two, in 1972 Marchese stopped
smoking for two months, at least two months, and
then he made a decision to resume smoking when
nicotine was no longer affecting his body in any
way.
And in 1973, the third fact, Mrs. Marchese
was told by her doctors that her cancer was caused
by smoking and that quitting smoking would prevent
a reoccurrence of cancer, she shared that
information with her husband and she began the
process of quitting.
So that, by 1974, she had
stopped smoking; she never smoked another
cigarette again.
So, even if you were to conclude that Mr.
Marchese did have COPD, if he had stayed a
nonsmoker in 1972 when he stopped smoking for at
least two months, or if he had joined his wife in
the quit attempt and stopped smoking in 1973, the
evidence is more likely than not he would have
prevented his own illness.
you everything you need to know to answer the
Those three facts give

We plucked you out of your lives.
Before I discuss the rest of the evidence,
I want to join everyone else here who has thanked
you.
We know,
we've heard you guys in the jury room on breaks,
sounds like you've been getting along, having good
time, maybe even made some friends.

And in recognition of that, I'm going to
try to be as respectful of your time now as I was
throughout the trial and not take up a lot of time
with a lot of questions.
Now, one of the areas I'd like to walk
around is this is Huizenga Park.
It's at the end
of Andrews right across the bridge, right on Las
Olas, and they have this great fountain there, the

stream kind of bounces up and down with the beat,
things like that.
It's a really nice place to go
and just kind of clear your mind.
I was walking to that park just a couple
days ago, approaching the fountain, and it
occurred to me that when you get there, you have
to make a decision.
You're on a path and you have
to make a decision; you have to go one way around
the fountain or the other, right or left.

to walk on one side or the other.
And it struck me that in a very real

had never smoked.
And there's other stuff going on.
Right
in his family, he's had family members who got
seriously ill, and in some cases, passed during
the 1960s because of smoking-related illnesses.
And warning labels, this is the warning
label that was on cigarettes back in 1972.

and a half months of not smoking, what does he
choose to do?

nicotine in his system, his family members are
getting smoking-related illnesses and every pack
of cigarettes that he smoked the year before the
accident, the year of the accident, the year after
the accident, all had this warning on them in
plain English.
So what he did was he made the same
informed choice that millions of smokers, both
then and now today, make.
Aware of the risks,
comfortable with those risks, and he chose to
continue to smoke.
And there's no evidence, none,
Plaintiffs didn't even argue it to you today, that
the reason he chose to start smoking again in 1972
was because of something that R.J. Reynolds or

part:

The answer was, "Of course."
Mr. Marchese made decisions that sometimes
are not in his own -- the best interests of his
own health.
Now I want to be clear about one thing:
I'm not criticizing Mr. Marchese for any of this. 04:41

I'm going to skip through a couple things.
Here's the slide I was looking for before
from Mrs. Marchese, said that the decision to quit
smoking is an individual choice.
Let me just briefly discuss Mr. Marchese's
I told you at the beginning that
smoking history.
the evidence would show that Mr. Marchese in his
life and his smoking history, the cigarettes made
by Reynolds were just not a significant factor and
now here, at the end, there's really no dispute
about that.
The evidence is clear Mr. Marchese didn't

04:44 4119
Now, I'm just going to add one thing about
Dr. Proctor because I think Mr. Cofer has covered
him very well.
Dr. Proctor made it clear that he
didn't know anything about Mr. Marchese or any
statements, anything, about that he might have, as
you can see here, heard, saw or relied upon.
That's for Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, American
Tobacco.

statements by a tobacco company."

what Mr. Marchese would have done if someone had

This is just the personal household
This doesn't include
All of these
You heard Plaintiff's counsel say that, in
1973 when Mrs. Marchese was warned about smoking,

smoking, she had breast cancer and she was told
not to smoke because it would -- it could cause a
reoccurrence, but you can just take Mrs.
Marchese's word for it, she said this is --
remember, what the lawyers say what the evidence
Here's what Mrs.
is, this is a perfect example.
Marchese actually said.
"You told Mr. Marchese when you were
diagnosed with breast cancer, you came home and
you told Mr. Marchese that your doctors told you
your cancer could be related to your smoking,
right?
Yes, I'm sure I mentioned it."
So there's no question, there's no debate
about whether or not this was known to Mr.

Now, the last topic I'm going to cover is
this question of punitive damages.
Respectfully,
as you work your way through the verdict form, and
I won't do that because I thought Mr. Cofer did
that for you, this is not a question that we
believe you should get to, but you are the final
deciders on that, so I need to talk about it for a
moment.
What you're being asked to do is after --
And then punitive

damages, they are saying -- they are asking you to
check a box that says, in addition, we may award
damages beyond what's necessary to fully and
fairly compensate Mrs. Marchese, additional money,
bonus money.
Judge, that only happens if the Plaintiffs
provided compelling evidence of the need to punish
and deter.
And that is only -- you heard the
You saw evidence of the efforts of
Reynolds to address the health risks of smoking.
And I want to just remind you of that when you
consider this question.
This is the president of R.J. Reynolds telling the

tobacco and health, and if there's a safer
cigarette, let's continue and increase our
efforts."
And that led to Reynolds participating
in the National Cancer Institute, Tobacco Working
Group.
The other things that you heard the
testimony about, empirical literature to the
Surgeon General.
Dr. Proctor even was forced to
admit that industry has funded more of the work

the tobacco industry, and that Reynolds as well as

that punitive damages should not be awarded
