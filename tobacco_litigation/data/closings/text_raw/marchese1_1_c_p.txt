MR. PENDELL:
it please the Court.
Thank you, your Honor, may

thought justice was easy.
I thought if you did
the right thing, followed the rules, good would
triumph over evil.
Of course, when I grew up, I
found that wasn't always the case.
that is not how the world works and that's why I
became a trial lawyer.
Not every day, but some
days, I get to participate in a justice system and
sometimes, sometimes I get to help make justice
happen.
Unfortunately,
Now, justice is not always easy.
In fact,
it's always hard, always hard, because justice
presents a threat to power.
In order to make
justice come into being, you have to fight power.
But each time you strike out against injustice,
you send forth tiny ripples and each of those tiny
ripples turns into a current that can sweep away
even the most gross and flagrant injustice.
And
that is why your job here in this courtroom is so
important.
Today, as Trudy Marchese's jury, you and
nobody else has the opportunity to do justice for
Sal Marchese, to make sure that the tragic story
of his life has a just ending.

Mr. Oliver, you heard him talk to you about how

this case was going to be about three things,
opportunity, choices, responsibility.
And you saw
and you heard a lot of evidence about the choices
that were made, the opportunities that were
squandered, the evasion of responsibility, the
failure of Philip Morris and Reynolds to take
responsibility for their actions, for designing
cigarettes that are addictive or pushing those
cigarettes on young people like Sal Marchese, and
denying, disputing and concealing material facts,
important facts, about the dangers of cigarettes
for more than four decades.
To be clear, these
are choices that Philip Morris and Reynolds made
that brought each and every one of you to this
moment in this courtroom today.
After everybody rests, you hear all the
lawyers speak, you guys are going to have to go
back into the jury room and you're going to have
to make a choice and the choice that you're going
to make is going to write the last chapter of Sal
Marchese's life.

when young Sal Marchese had started smoking and
grew into a man in the 50s and 60s, if we could go
back to those days, people would be smoking right
here in this courtroom, right at this moment.

MR. PENDELL:
That was April 1994.
In
1950s and 60s, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris are
internally referring to nicotine as a potent drug
and, in 1994, they are walking into Congress
raising their right hand and swearing under oath
that nicotine is not addictive.
By the way, I don't know if you noticed,
but the same definition of addiction that the

courtrooms up until the year 2000, decades after
it was out of date.
R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris's choices
do not stop at denying and disputing the addictive
nature of nicotine.
They also chose to focus the
design and the engineering of their cigarettes to
sustain addiction and to make people think that
they were getting a safer cigarette.
Dr. Proctor
told you and showed you documents about how they
put filters on cigarettes to assure smokers and he
told you that those filters didn't actually work.
People thought they were getting a safer cigarette
and they weren't.

Well, in 1953, you saw that
they choose to do?
Reynolds and Philip Morris and all of the other
tobacco companies, they met with a public
relations firm called Hill & Knowlton in New York
City in The Plaza Hotel, although -- and what went
on behind the closed doors there was secret for
decades.
Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies,
they made a secret agreement and that agreement
was that they were going to do everything that
they could to create doubt and controversy about
the emerging health risks of smoking.
They want
to call them into question for one purpose, to
keep people smoking.
And this campaign of doubt
and controversy, as you saw, went on for almost
50 years.
Why, why did they do it, why did they
want to keep people like Sal Marchese smoking from
learning about the truth about addiction and that

And, in it, they promised that the
public's health was their paramount concern and
that their products were not harmful and that they
would cooperate with the public health authorities
and that they would fund research.
And they also
told smokers that the health charges against
smoking had been abandoned for lack of evidence.

these two Defendants broke every single one of
those promises repeatedly.

cigarettes and protect them -- it was part of
their strategy, part of their efforts to work as a
cohesive group to keep information from people
like Sal Marchese, and it lasted for 50 years.
Now, we showed you internal documents
proving that this campaign of doubt and
controversy was conceived, engineered and
implemented by these two Defendants and that it
was successful in maintaining the social
acceptability of cigarettes in this country for
almost 50 years by their own internal documents,
documents they kept from people like Sal Marchese,

This is the actual definition of the Engle

And it's going to be up to you when you go

whether or not Sal Marchese is a member of this
class.
That's what all
this has been about.
That's why you're here.
And to determine whether or not Sal
Marchese was a member of this class, you're going
to have to answer three questions and I'm going to
go through them and talk about them in a minute,
but, first, I want to talk to you about -- Mr.

You remember he showed you Lady
burden of proof.
Justice with the scales?
Abe Lincoln, who most us
know as one of our greatest presidents, what some
people don't know is he was also a great trial
lawyer, one of the best, and what made him a great
trial lawyer was his ability to take a complex
legal concept and make it simple so that the
farmers and laborers that he represented could
understand it.
And in talking about the burden of
proof and what it meant to have to prove his case
by the greater weight of the evidence, Mr. Lincoln
explained that if he took a single grain of
wheat --
MR. COFER:
Objection, your Honor,
improper argument, improper analogy.
THE COURT:
MR. PENDELL:
Overruled.
If you took a single grain
of wheat and placed it on his side of the scales
of justice and it tipped ever so slightly in his
favor, he'd established his burden.
So keep that
in mind when you go back into the jury room to
make a decision as to whether or not Mr. Marchese
fits into that class definition.
Now, what do you have to decide?
I'll
tell you first at the outset, there's going to be

there.
He tried, but he didn't.
He didn't quit.
But it doesn't matter.
The only thing you need to
decide is was he addicted and, if so, was it the
reason that he smoked so many cigarettes over the
course of his life that it caused him to get sick.
To help you answer this question, we
brought you Dr. Tonia Werner.
Dr. Werner is a
forensic psychiatrist, a medical doctor and the
program director for the Division of Forensic

you all about her experience treating addiction of
heroin and cocaine and nicotine.
that addiction has two components, it has a
physical component and it has a psychological
component.
You learned that nicotine actually
changes the structure and the function of your
brain.
She taught you
Sal Marchese had no choice about nicotine
crossing his blood-brain barrier.
He had no
choice about the effect nicotine had on his
acetylcholine receptors.
Those caused physical
withdrawal symptoms if the body does not get its
required dose of nicotine.

situations, times, places.
Those things provide
cues.
They trigger an addict -- an addicted
smoker's memory of smoking and they last for
years.
Dr. Werner told you that she used three
tools to assess nicotine addiction and she applied
all three of these to Sal Marchese and she
concluded that Sal Marchese had a severe addiction
to cigarettes containing nicotine.

people who actually knew him was that Sal Marchese
was a chain smoker and Sal Marchese was chained to
smoking.
Dr. Werner told you that another symptom
of addiction is that a person interrupts important
life activities to smoke.
Trudy Marchese and his
daughter Theresa Irwin both told you that Sal
could not sit through an hour-long church service
without having to go outside to smoke.
Marchese told you that when she and Sal would go
to the movies in later years when they no longer
allowed smoking, Sal Marchese would have to get up
from that movie and he would sometimes sneak off
into the bathroom to smoke in private because he
had to have a cigarette.
Trudy
Trudy Marchese, who slept in the same room
with Sal Marchese for 46 years, told you that that
man got out of that bed every single night of his
life, sometimes twice, to smoke.
Sal Marchese had
his first cigarette of the day when he woke up.
His daughter said she would see him lounging in
bed smoking and it scared her, it scared her
because she was afraid the bed would catch on
fire.

Dr. Werner and the DSM-V both told you
that another tell-tale sign of addiction was

life-threatening lung disease, he kept smoking.

back to his normal self.
You heard all three of
them tell you that Sal Marchese set off an alarm
in an airport because he went outside to smoke.
He had to get his fix.
Now, counsel for Philip Morris suggested
to you that maybe he just didn't see the large
letters indicating that it was an emergency exit
for authorized personnel only.
Dr. Werner told
you that all of these things prove that Sal
Marchese was addicted to cigarettes containing
nicotine.
You heard Dr. Werner tell you that
nicotine addiction was the principal reason Sal
Marchese was unable to quit smoking.
Ladies and gentlemen, nobody asked you to
check your common sense and good judgment at the
door when you entered this courtroom.
In fact, I
submit to you that is why each you have was chosen
to be on this jury, because everybody wanted you
to bring your common sense and good judgment with
you into that courtroom.
You didn't need to hear
Dr. Werner testify to convince you what your
common sense and good judgment already tells you,
that Sal Marchese was an addict.
You heard that

Defendants talked to you about Sal
Marchese's coma in 1972 and they have been trying
to convince you this whole trial that Sal Marchese
started on day zero when he came out of that coma.
They want you to forget about the almost 30 years
of his life that he smoked compulsively 40, 50,
60, sometimes more, cigarettes a day his whole
life.
They want to pretend it didn't happen.
They want you to forget about the fact that as
soon as he came out of that coma, he asked his
wife for cigarettes.
They want you to believe
that smoking is not an addiction but a slight
annoyance that you can will yourself past after a
couple of uncomfortable days.
Sal Marchese was asking to smoke when he
awoke from a coma because of a psychological
addiction because it was something that he did

Dr. Saltzman did not remember Sal
Marchese, okay?
Like many doctors who treat lots
of patients, this visit took place over 20 years
ago, but Dr. Saltzman testified to some very
important facts.
First, contrary to how it's
tried to be presented here in this courtroom, Dr.
Saltzman was unequivocal in his testimony that if
he wrote COPD, based on his experience and his
training and his integrity, he believes that that
is what he believed Mr. Marchese had at the time
he wrote it.
That was his testimony.
Dr. Saltzman also testified that what he
thought that code, the bronchospasm code, the
94060, just looking at it, he thought that that

a pre and post bronchodilator spirometry.
what did you learn about that?
that is used to make a determination as to whether
or not someone has chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
Dr. Saltzman testified he would never
claim to have performed a procedure that he did
not perform for the sake of getting reimbursed by
an insurance company.
He also testified that if he, indeed, did
a PFT test, looking at that code, he believes
that's what that was indicated, that if he had
given that test, the results would have been
available to him at the time and that diagnosis
would have been based on Mr. Marchese's clinical
presentation, his history and that pulmonary
function test.

But the Defendants want

COPD when he wrote COPD.

on this man.
We've shown you the
records from seven different doctors, all of whom
actually laid hands on Sal Marchese and all of
whom agreed that he had COPD.
That evidence
cannot be outweighed by the testimony of Dr.
Frazier.
You heard testimony from Theresa Irwin and
her daughter Roseanne Gorman that they remember
Sal having shortness of breath and chronic cough
Roseanne

they were taking a walk in Assisi and Sal Marchese
could not make that walk because of exertional

he did not have lung cancer at that time.
It's --
that lung cancer he had was a fast lung cancer, it
happened in a matter of months.
Sal Marchese did
not have lung cancer that was affecting his breath
in the 1990s when he went to Italy; those are
symptoms of COPD.
You heard Dr. Frazier that

is caused by cigarettes.

Now, let's talk about the fourth question
and I'm going to sit down and let Mr. Oliver talk
for a while, finally.
Question 4 is comparative fault.
Defendants have told you throughout the course of
this trial that they bear no responsibility for
what happened to Sal Marchese, they want you to
believe, despite the fact that they manufactured a
dangerous and defective product, despite the fact
they marketed this dangerous, defective product,
despite the fact that they did it to young people
like Sal Marchese and to Sal Marchese, despite the
fact they spent more than four decades concealing
the health risks and addictive nature of that
dangerous and defective product, and despite
evidence that they did everything they could do to
manipulate that dangerous and defective product to
keep Sal Marchese hooked, that all the blame 01:58

That's what they want
But they have done nothing to prove that
Sal Marchese was negligent, and as the Judge told
you, that's their burden of proof.
That's the one
thing they bear the burden of proving.
Marchese did what they wanted him to do.

You remember -- John, this is the slide of
Mr. Heimann.
You heard Mr. Heimann.
He was the former
CEO of American Tobacco, the company that brought
you Lucky Strikes, and he told you that he wanted
people like Sal Marchese to buy their cigarettes,
to smoke them and buy more.
And, in fact, he said
he wouldn't blame somebody for smoking a pack or
two of their products every day, that is what they
wanted people to do.

product without full knowledge of the harmful
effects, without full knowledge of the addictive
nature and without knowledge that they were
manipulating those cigarettes to keep him
addicted.
If you make a product that's going to kill
or harm people in this country, you have the
responsibility to tell your customers that
information.
You don't get to come into a
courtroom and say you should have known it was
harmful.
You have to take responsibility.

That's not how it works in this place.
They have to
Now, I expect Reynolds to come up here in
their closing argument and tell you they are not
to blame because Mr. Marchese mostly smoked

but the evidence says otherwise because we know
that, at a minimum, Mr. Marchese smoked Lucky

So the evidence is he was probably was

Trudy Marchese and he was smoking several packs a

smoking them longer and we know his father was
smoking Lucky Strikes.
We also know that it was
one of the most popular brands at that period of
time.
And the Dorals also mattered.
The fact
Trudy Marchese told you
It mattered because when the price of
they were bargain priced cigarettes, that
mattered.
cigarettes went up, it provided a way for Sal
Marchese to keep smoking.
that he switched to Dorals because they were
cheaper.
So the Dorals mattered, the price
mattered, and each one of those cigarettes was a
brick in the road that led Sal Marchese to COPD
and lung cancer.

Each one of those bricks

02:02 Who controlled the advertising?

responsibility belongs to Reynolds and Philip
Morris and how much belongs to Sal Marchese, ask
yourselves who had the power?

manipulated the cigarettes to sustain addiction?
Who denied, disputed and concealed the information
about the health risks for over four decades?
Who
squandered the opportunity to change the course of
history for Sal Marchese and smokers just like him
by telling the truth?
place profits over people?
Who refused to take
responsibility for what happened for over four
decades?
It wasn't Sal Marchese.
Who made the choice to
So think about that when you're trying to
decide how much blame to place on Reynolds and
Philip Morris and Sal Marchese because they
deserve the lion's share of responsibility.
Now, briefly, Defendants tried to convince
you over the course of this trial that Sal
Marchese knew that smoking was dangerous to his
health as far backs as 1961 when his dad had a
heart attack.
The Surgeon
General of the United States, a trained doctor,
That defies logic.
Who had the

Who 02:02
02:02 02:03 02:03

02:03 3999
did not come to the conclusion that cigarettes
were injurious to health until 1964 and they want
you to believe that a high school dropout
bricklayer knew in 1961 that it was cigarettes
that caused his father's heart stake.
that.
Think about
Finally, with regard to Mrs. Marchese's
breast cancer, they want you to believe that Mr.
Marchese was on notice because his wife got breast
cancer, but Trudy told you that she and Sal didn't
discuss it, her doctors never told her
definitively that smoking caused it.
that the advice to quit smoking was personal to
her.

'73, that's not unreasonable.
She did not think that men could get breast
That's not unreasonable in 1971, '72 or
She believed
You saw that many people in this country
did not know about the health risks of smoking,
including after the Surgeon General released his
report, that's how that happened.
That lack of
knowledge continued because of the things that
these Defendants did.
So how can you blame Sal
Marchese for that?
How can you blame an addict
for that?
So I just ask when you go back to that
02:03
02:03

jury room and you have to decide how to rack up
fault in this case, keep those things in mind.
I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Oliver.
I appreciate it.


MR. OLIVER:
Counsel, thank you.
Good afternoon, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury.
We are in the home stretch
and I'm sure you all are glad and I'm not going to
get up and tell you that I'm going to be brief,
I'm going to try, okay, and
but hopefully I will.
I think I can at least fulfill my promise to try.
Thank you for your patience and your
attention.
It's such a pleasure to work with
people like Mike who have a passion for their
clients and what we do.
My job is to talk to you
today about the claims that we didn't discuss much
during the opening and those are the fraud and
I'm also going to talk to you
conspiracy claims.
about Trudy Marchese's damages and whether Philip
Morris's and Reynolds' actions over 45 years are
worthy of punishment.
So let's jump right into
it.
Let's go to fraud and concealment.
I'm going to talk to you about these
questions together because fraud and concealment,
really, they are slightly different -- excuse me,
02:04
02:04 02:05
02:05
02:05
02:05
02:05
02:05
02:05
02:05
02:05
02:06
02:06
02:06
02:06 4001
The conspiracy claim goes with
the fraudulent concealment claim and then the
conspiracy claim.
it, it means they committed fraud and they
concealed stuff and they got together and they
agreed to do it.
Here's the point:
The key information
that you're going to have to determine with these
questions is whether Sal Marchese relied on
something that the Defendants said, something the
Defendants knew but did not say, or something that
the Defendants did as part of their conspiracy.
So the question number 5 reads, "Did
Salvatore Marchese reasonably rely to his
detriment on any statement of material fact made
by each Defendant that concealed or omitted
material information not otherwise known or
available to him concerning the health effects or
addictive nature of smoking cigarettes and, if so,
was the concealment a legal cause of Salvatore
Marchese's death?"
Here's what reliance means:
It just means
that we have to prove more likely than not that
something they said or they did not say affected
Mr. Marchese's decision.
The Judge has already
provided you with the law and instructions in this 02:06
02:06
02:06
02:06
02:06
02:06
02:06
02:06
02:06 02:07 4002
I'm not going to go through them in depth,
case.
but I want to highlight three of the most
important things when you're looking at the issue
of reliance.
First, there is no requirement that Philip
Morris and Reynolds ever made a statement directly
to Mr. Marchese.
And that's makes sense because
in this country and in any country where you have
advertisements or you buy products from companies,
I don't call up Kraft Foods when I'm going to buy
some cheese and say, hey, Kraft, can I have some
cheese?
package of Kraft and there are things written on
the package of Kraft, there are advertisements
about the package of Kraft cheese, but that is
their communication with me.
The messages they
put out.
I go to the grocery store and I pick up a
So the instructions you're going to get
will say, and I am going to read directly from the
instruction to make sure that I get it right, it
will say, "It's not necessary that a direct
statement be made to the representee in order to
give rise to the right to rely upon the statement,
for it is immaterial whether it passes through a
direct or circuitous channel in reaching her," 02:07 02:07
02:07 02:08
02:08
02:08
02:08 4003
should be him in this case, "provided it be made
with the intent that it shall reach him and be
acted upon by the injured party."
And we talked about
Now, I think the evidence is in this case
that the messages that Reynolds and Philip Morris
sent out there to everybody, I think the evidence
is that those messages got to Sal Marchese
But even if they
directly in many instances.
didn't, you heard Dr. Proctor talk about the
concept of causes of causes.
this, we showed a Marlboro advertisement of the
father and son, he talked about how Sal Marchese's
whole family was smoking and all of his friends
were smoking.
generation were smoking.
didn't get that message directly from Reynolds and
Philip Morris, I guarantee you the evidence shows
that he got it from his family and his friends and
his peers and that environment that they created.
So it's okay if it didn't get to him directly.
I
think the evidence shows that it did, but I wanted
to explain that because it's something you don't
deal with every day.
75 percent of people in Sal's
And if Sal Marchese
The second important aspect of reliance is
Sal's reliance only needs to be reasonable.
this: 02:08

02:09
02:09
02:09
02:09
02:09 4004
And that's important because you have to look at
where Sal came from, who he was.

bricklayer, he didn't graduate high school.

He's not required to have been

You

30s.

He's
not a doctor, he's not at the top of the
profession, you don't hold him to that standard.
That's not Sal Marchese and the law
His reliance only needs to be
And I would submit to you that you've
heard evidence from Dr. Proctor about how many
doctors were smoking.

Association to go tell people I'm smoking a bunch
and I don't think it's a problem for me, you heard

02:09 02:10 02:10
02:10 4005
50 percent of doctors to be smoking during that
time, for astronauts to be smoking during that
time, then it is more than reasonable for Sal
Marchese, the bricklayer, to have believed the
health messages he heard, the false, the
misleading health messages he heard from
Defendants and to have relied on those statements
and smoked their cigarettes.
So this is the framework that I want you
to remember, but what is it that Sal Marchese
actually relied on?
We've talked a lot about
So that's the first thing that Sal
advertising.
Marchese relied on.
When he was a teenager, I am
very certain that the evidence we presented shows
you that he had that message.
It was out there,
it was ubiquitous, it was everywhere and he got
it.
I also want you to remember that it's
These advertisements
about what they did not say.
typically did not say this is healthy, what they
did was they gave you a positive reassurance of,
well, these are the type of people who do this and
what's important is they knew things internally
that they didn't put in the advertisement.
They
never put somebody on an advertisement lugging an 02:10

02:11 4006
They didn't tell people about

for lung cancer.
those things and they knew it.
say in their advertisements, hey, you can do this,
but once you start, you may not be able to quit.
That was information that they had and they didn't
put in their advertisements.
Before 1999, they never said their
So they never said what they really knew,
Before 1999, they
and this went on for decades.
never said their products caused cancer and COPD.
They never said their products were addictive
before 1999.
cigarettes were a habit that people could not
break.
And before 1999, they never said that
their own research confirmed what the public
health authorities were saying.
And that's
important.
some people were saying it, but the Defendants
themselves, Philip Morris and Reynolds, believed
it internally and they didn't come out and say we
believe it.
Because it's important not only that
They dispute it.
Now, even today, you heard the CEO -- or,
excuse me, you heard an employee of Reynolds who
was on Reynolds' leadership team and you heard a

research scientist, Dr. Jupe, for Philip Morris
say that even today, they will not admit, this was
2011 was when their testimony was given, that
addiction causes disease.
So how do we know?
What is the evidence
that Sal got this message and he relied on it?
Well, let's go back to that video that I showed
Can we switch over?
you, Mr. Cullman.
you hit that play for us there, John?
Okay.

"And we've got the one ad that we sent to

MR. OLIVER:
Can you highlight something

Can you

It talks about the flavor and the flip top
to talk about this a little bit later, but it

Marlboro is new and when it's coming out and,

That's going to deliver the same flavor
That's important because it wasn't just
It was
So Joe Cullman just told us about the
power of advertising, 30 days, New York City, top
of the market.
That's how powerful their ads were
and we know that Sal Marchese relied on that
because that's one of the brands he chose.
didn't smoke an off brand, he smoked a brand that
they pushed and that ultimately became the best
selling cigarette ever.
He
Now, we are talking about Marlboro and be
glad you chose a filter and that's important
because, remember, Sal Marchese started with Lucky
Lucky Strike was an unfiltered cigarette
Strike. 02:14
02:14
02:14
02:14
02:14
02:14
02:14
02:14
02:14
02:15
02:15
02:15 4009
They later developed a filter,
for the most part.
but during Sal Marchese's early smoking years,
Lucky Strike wasn't a popular filter brand.
You
heard evidence that American Tobacco Company sort
of got left behind and that Philip Morris got its
entree into the market by introducing Marlboro
with the filter.
And American Tobacco and Lucky
Strike, they never took full advantage of that.
And that tells us that Sal Marchese was getting
the message, the exact message that they wanted
him and every other smoker to get to reassure them
about their worries on health.
Let's look at the Heimann slide.
What did Robert K. Heimann, the former
Joe
Cullman for Philip Morris told us advertising
worked.
CEO of American Tobacco brands, they manufactured
Lucky Strike, what did he say?
He
summaries, this is not exactly his testimony.
wanted the public to believe that cigarettes were
not injurious to their health and he thought
people could rely on the statements that they put
in their advertising and that people, when they
were smoking the company's cigarettes, they were
doing exactly what the company wanted them to do.
These are
Next slide, please. 02:15 02:15
02:16

02:16
02:16
02:16
02:16
02:16
02:16 4010
And he said, "Would you agree that the
amount of money spent on advertising had a pretty
direct correlation in 1970 with the units sold of
that product?
I certainly would agree with that.
There
has to be that correlation.
That is the purpose of advertising, isn't
it?
Yes.
And you wouldn't spend on advertising if
it didn't work, would you?
We try not to."
And we also saw -- can we go to
Exhibit 580, John.
This was the Berger
And
We also saw this:
It was from the files of Brown &
study.
Williamson, which is now owned by Reynolds.
it tells us that in 1946, when Sal Marchese is
13 years old, roughly the same time that he's
experimenting for the first time with cigarettes,
Lucky Strike hits their all-time peak of
103.5 billion cigarettes in 1946, when they are
spending money on the brand, when they are
advertising, when they are pushing them to the top
of market, Sal Marchese is choosing the brands 02:16
02:16
02:16

02:16

There were a lots of
that they are pushing.
brands out there and some were not promoted as
heavily as Lucky, some were not promoted as
Marlboro, but Sal Marchese chose the ones that
they promoted the most heavily.
And the Berger
study concludes by saying that "The rise and fall
of every brand of consequence has been traced in
detail in their year-to-year success or failure
shown to be the direct result of consumer
So we know it worked because their

employees have told us it worked, they spent money
on it and we've seen studies, their own studies
that show that it actually worked.
If I get into a
Now, finally, we know that he relied on
their messages because Sal Marchese did exactly
what they wanted him to do.
situation where I'm buying a car and I say I want
a car with good brakes and the guy at the car
dealership says I've got a car with good brakes
and I say, well, I'm relying on your statement
that this car has good brakes.
I go down the hill
and it doesn't have good brakes, we all know why I
relied because he made a direct misrepresentation
and I told him this is important to me.
But this is a concealment case and the
02:17
02:17

02:17

02:17

02:17
02:17 02:18
02:18
02:18
02:18 4012
problem with this proving reliance in a
concealment case is simply that it's hard to know
how somebody would have reacted with information
that you never share with them.
So you have to
look at the circumstances and you have to look at
their actions.
If the message was to do this and
the person went out and did what they wanted them
to do, then that is evidence of reliance.
So what else did Sal Marchese rely on
He
besides Defendants' advertising messages?
relied on the Defendants to tell the truth about
their products and to make an honest product.
Remember, when their conspiracy started, they
concealed this knowledge that their products were
addicting and killing people, and this is when
filter cigarettes were rising.
Now, talking about filter cigarettes,
earlier during the trial, I don't know if you'll
remember, we published from Exhibit 806.

some of the pages of it.
wondering what we were doing.
This is a presentation giving inside of Philip
Morris in the 90s, it's looking back and somebody
is talking about the history of where the
You might have been

This is evidence. 02:18

Filter cigarettes offered what
cigarette market was going.
Suddenly, because of
the smoking and health publicity, this is in the
50s, filter cigarettes became not only acceptable
but necessary.
smokers perceived -- not what was a health
benefit, we heard there was none, what they
perceived as a health benefit.
Morris, who is making Marlboro, this is their
entry into the filter market, rises from 9 percent
of the market in 1953, number 6 in line, you heard
Joe Cullman say it, to 42 percent of the market in
1989.
And that Philip
And they are still on top.
It was filter fraud.
They not only got
the message out there through their advertising,
they got it in there through their box and they
got the fraud out there through their product.
They manufactured a product and made you think it
was better for you, and then later, they didn't
tell people this, but people later learned that
it's absolutely no better for you to smoke a
filtered cigarette.
It's just as addicting, it's
just as likely to cause cancer, it's just likely
to cause COPD.
And Sal Marchese relied on the
company not to make a product in a way that was
intentionally deceptive to him. 02:19
02:19
02:19 02:20 02:20
02:20
02:20 Finally, Mr. Marchese relied on

There could have been a lot of reasons.
I
Do you remember
Well, we know this because
Defendants' campaign of doubt and controversy.
How do we know this?
Mr. Marchese kept smoking, which is what the
campaign wanted them to do, and he didn't try to
quit in the 50s and the 60s and the 70s.
Well,
why?
think one of the reasons is this:
when Dr. Werner was on the stand and she talked
about the concept of information having power?
And I asked her a question that was basically, you
know, do you tell people that they have a problem
when you're trying to get them off a drug?
she says yeah.
them?
addict, they need to know that they have a
disease.
If they don't know that they have a
disease and they don't know that they have a
problem, they don't understand the nature of what
they are dealing with, they won't know that they
need to make a plan.
And
And I said why, why do you tell
Because they need to know they are an
The Defendants have made a big deal about
the fact that somebody needs to make a plan to
quit smoking and I believe the evidence shows that
one of the reasons that Mr. Marchese, like so many 02:20 02:21 02:21 4015
people, didn't make a plan is because he didn't
realize how big the problem was until it was too
late.
Until he was coming out of a coma for two
months and saying I want a cigarette.
Until he's
in the 80s telling his daughter -- at that point,
yeah, in the 80s, yeah, I think by the 80s, he
probably figured out he had a problem because he
was telling his daughter don't let the baby smoke.
Don't let Roseanne smoke because, once she does,
she's never going to be able to quit.
And that's
when he knew he had a problem.
How would his life have been different if
the Defendants had come out in the 50s and 60s and
said, hey, this isn't just a little thing, it's
easy to blow off, this is a disease, it's a
problem, and in order to get off it, you're going
to need some help?
So
he relied on their campaign of doubt and
controversy.
But they didn't do that.
And can we look at 86?
This was the forwarding memorandum and I
This is right when
want to show you how early.

recounting some of the things they heard the
cigarette industry men saying at a meeting.
It
says, "One of the men said it's fortunate for us
that cigarettes are a habit they can't break."
1954.
cigarettes are a habit you can't break?
they had done that, then the world might be a
different place, but they didn't do that.
And
they didn't do it until 1999.
What if they had come out and said, folks,
Well, if
So that's how Mr. Marchese relied on the
fraud of Philip Morris and Reynolds, but was his
reliance reasonable?
I said he has to be a reasonable man during this
time period, right?
Well, let's start with the
Engle findings.
And that's important because
We looked at these earlier.
Philip Morris
and Reynolds were negligent -- I'm sorry, number
5, "Philip Morris and Reynolds concealed or
omitted material information not otherwise known
or available knowing that the concealed or omitted
information was false or misleading or failed to
disclose a material fact concerning the health
effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes
So you start with the Engle findings,
or both."
02:22
02:22
02:22
02:22
02:22
02:22 02:23
02:23
02:23
02:23
02:23
02:23
02:23
02:23
02:23
02:23 4017
the Engle jury found that the information that was
out there was material, it was important, and the
jury instructions -- this is what the jury
instructions say about material information that
the jury found they withheld that kind of
information.
"Material information is information that
is of such importance that a reasonable person
would consider same significant in their
decision-making process."
information and the information they withheld was
so important that a reasonable person would think
of that in making their decision.
that's number one.
So they withheld
Okay.
So
Number two is, "Not otherwise known or
Okay.
That's important because Dr.
available."
Proctor talked to you at length about some of the
information that was publicly available.
And we
make no dispute, there was information out there
about cigarettes being harmful and, in fact,
that's why Defendants had to get together and form
their conspiracy.
If they hadn't gotten together
and formed their conspiracy, the world might be a
different place because the public health
authorities were starting at that time to realize
02:23
02:23 02:24
02:24
02:24
02:24
02:24
02:24
02:24
02:24
02:24 4018
something was going on.
Scientists were doing the
mouse skin painting studies and this stuff was in
the news.
But, remember, those aren't the things we
are talking about, we are talking about things
that were not otherwise known or available, and
we've shown you things that were not otherwise
We've shown you Defendants'
known or available.
own internal files and that they understood the
severity and extent of addiction long before the
public health authorities and other scientists in
the public had called on and, certainly, long
before Sal Marchese ever did.
So the information that they hid was
important and it was stuff that, frankly, only
they knew.
But this is the final piece of the
puzzle that I want you to consider and this is
not -- you know, this is not an instruction.
is just something that I think goes to what my
colleague Mike was talking about and that is the
common sense nature of this inquiry.
When you're
thinking about reliance, you have to consider the
quality of information, you have to consider the
quantity of information, and you have to consider
the source of the information.
This 02:25
02:25
02:25
02:25
02:25
02:25
02:25
02:25
02:25
02:26 4019
So we talked about how Philip Morris and
Reynolds were the fathers of mass communication.
They had the Marlboro Man, and I've got a great
blowup of one of the Marlboro men here.
Okay.
Can everybody see that?
is one of the greatest advertising campaigns ever.
So the quality of their false message, the quality
of their reassurance message was top notch.
was the best in the business.
Everybody got it?
This
It
The box that they made was a success.
You
heard Joe Cullman talk about the box, because they
hired an ad man to create it.
A box manufacturer
didn't create the packaging for Marlboro, an
advertising executive created it.
that.
actually designed the box.
wrapping some stuff up in some paper, it was, hey,
we are going to make this part of our ad campaign.
Somebody who an expert in advertising
Wasn't just like I'm
Think about
And when they conspired to create doubt
and controversy about the health effects of their
products, they put that same -- the same level of
resources, they put the same level of ingenuity
and they put the same power behind that campaign
as well.
That was the big ad that they ran after the
You heard about the Frank Statement. 02:26

02:26
02:26

promises to the public.

news services in New York.
lie to people, they did it right.
And that, you know, it
When they wanted to
They also -- so they have the quality.
And they had the quantity.
It wasn't just like one ad or two
That's what I'm talking about, the quality of the
They had
information.
the exposure.
ads, as soon as they realized they had that
Marlboro Man, it was working, bam, it was
everywhere.
I don't know if you remember this, but
when Cullman was talking about the Marlboro Man,
when they first started and it became so
successful, he said he went back and they did the
Marlboro Country.
So it went from Marlboro Man,
it went from one guy or girl or a series of men to
Marlboro Country, the whole world, right, and
that's how it became.
So they had the quality and they had the
They hired -- I don't know if you
quantity.
remember the evidence about the third party
strategy, but there was an article in TRUE
Magazine that was suggesting that there was still 02:27
02:27
02:27
02:27
02:27
02:27

02:27

02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28 4021
And if
a controversy about smoking and health.
you'll remember, Dr. Proctor told us that the guy
who wrote that was hired by the tobacco industry,
it wasn't disclosed, and that they then ran that
fake article in other publications under the names
of other fake authors who didn't actually write
that article.
So they had quality and they had
They had that message, it was good
the quantity.
looking and it was everywhere.
So you have to compare the quality and
quantity of Reynolds' and Philip Morris's campaign
to keep people smoking to the public health
message and the sources of information that were
out there.
I think Dr. Proctor told us that over
the course of history, there was something like 30
articles, give or take, in Reader's Digest about
the dangers of smoking.
the number of articles that were actually in
Reader's Digest ever and it was, you know, a
ridiculous comparison.
And then he gave you
30.
Can we see the slide?
Question:
"Do you know what the
difference in spending on cigarette advertising
was versus PSAs?"
Remember, PSAs were the Bill
That
Talman and the Yul Brynner advertisements. 02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28
02:28
02:29
02:29
02:29
02:29
02:29
02:29
02:29 4022
And he said they had an
was powerful stuff.
"Well, there is no
impact on some people.
It's like a snowflake versus a
comparison.
snowstorm.
The estimates are that there is more
spent by the cigarette industry in one day than
the health association spent in a whole year on
these public health messages."
So you compare the quality of what they
were doing and the quantity of what they were
doing with the contrary message.
understand whether Mr. Marchese's choices were
reasonable under the circumstances.
That's how you
Now, finally, the source matters.
The
Now, what do I
source of information matters.
mean about this?
Well, in order to figure out if
Mr. Marchese relied on something, you are really
asking would something in his life have changed,
would the informational environment have changed
such that he might have made a different choice?
So you have to imagine a world in which all of
these things Defendants did, either didn't happen,
either that they didn't do them, or that when they
did them with the same quantity and quality that
the public health messages out there.
happened, what would have happened if the source
So what 02:29 02:30

of the negative information about smoking was
Defendants themselves and what would have happened
if, instead of putting all of that money and power
behind the wrong information, they put it behind
the right information?
So I've got an example I want to use.
Now, this

What if in 1953, before the conspiracy
ever started, there were ads out there saying,
"The studies of clinical data tend to confirm the
relationship of heavy and prolonged tobacco
smoking and the incidence of lung cancer"?
That's

02:30
02:30 02:31 02:31 4024
from a Reynolds document.
Obviously, I know Reynolds didn't run the
Marlboro Man ad, but the point is what if the
Defendants had gotten out there and said we agree?
What if they had said, hey, this is bad stuff and
we agree?
don't need to do it, it's bad for you.
they had done that with the same force and effect
that they put out their false messages?
If you want to do it, fine, but you
What if
And what about this:
This is one -- this
Is this Philip Morris or Reynolds?
Nonetheless, it's

are the only source of replacement smokers."
If he knew that the
Marchese was a family man.
Defendants were internally calling teenagers and
young people replacement smokers, do you think he
might have tried to find a way to quit or a way to
not give that company his money?
I think he might
have if he knew what they really said, if he knew
what the truth was.
So that's the world you have to imagine,
and I think the evidence is that if Defendants had
done this, if they had put forward the right 02:31
02:31 02:32 02:32
02:32 4025
message with the same force that they put forward
the wrong message, the world would be a different
place and people like Sal Marchese would have quit
and they would have been able to get the help and
they would have known that they needed to get the
help.
So he relied on that controversy.
And the other reason we know that he did
Because even
is because of this (indicating).
though all that information came out and you have
this little dip in the 50s and you had these
little dips where the Surgeon General's report
comes down, doubt and controversy, the conspiracy
keeps that thing going up.
So we know that not
only Sal Marchese relied, but millions of other
smokers relied.
Remember, I promised you at the beginning
of this you would learn something new about
cigarettes and cigarette smoking, and I think I
made good on my promise.
This is 2015, with all
the information we have and all of the things we
know, it doesn't make sense that in 1940 and 1950
and 1960 that Sal Marchese knew all of the things
they claim he knew or should have known.
It just
doesn't make sense.
So can we have the ELMO?

on the fraud claims, you still have to get to the
damages question.
If you answer questions 1
through 3, you'll go to comparative fault and
you'll go to damages.
Even if you don't answer
yes for us in the fraud counts, I want to make
that clear.
You know, damages is difficult.
How do
you place a monetary value on the things that 02:34
02:34

Well, it's not easy.
Trudy Marchese lost?
The
Judge's instructions will say something to the
effect of there's no exact standard for fixing
compensation.
You have to do what's fair and
just, and if you believe she's been damaged, you
have to give her a full measure of compensation
for the damages.
And that is the loss of Sal's
companionship, the loss of his protection, and her
mental pain and suffering for that loss and for
watching her husband trying to crawl out of the
bed when he's got a tumor wrapped around his spine
and get a cigarette.
So she's lived 11 years without her

that, she's watched a lot of good things in life
go by that it might bring her joy, and she told us
it would, just to have him see those things.
She
hasn't gotten to sit with Sal and watch Matthew
and Mason, her great grandchildren, because Sal is
not here.
And if it weren't for smoking, we think
the evidence is that Sal Marchese would still be

that weren't smoking-related health problems.
She
has lived 11 years without that and it's her loss,
her 11 years without Sal Marchese.
So what am I asking you for?
We are
asking you for $1 million for every year that you
think she went without Mr. Marchese's loss or
protection and companionship.
Now, what does that mean?
That may sound
like a lot of money, but let me tell you why it's
not.

If Trudy Marchese had $2,700 and she could
pay that for day of Sal Marchese's time for one
more day, I guarantee you she would pay it and she
would pay it over and over again until she was
dead broke.

The final question on your verdict form is
whether punitive damages are warranted by
Defendants' conduct.
And we bear the burden of
proving entitlement to punitive damages by clear
and convincing evidence.
That's a higher burden
and I think we've met that burden.
First, if you find for us on fraud and you
award damages, punitive damages, there's not going
to be any result for comparative fault if you find
for -- excuse me, there are not going to be any
reduction for comparative fault if you find for us

guys to understand.

so gross and flagrant as to show a reckless

sure they gave it to them.
Because if they didn't
give it to them, the cigarette market would go out
of business and we know that because when they
talk about making a nicotine-less cigarette,
nobody buys it.
And when their executives get up
in depositions in 2011, they talked about whether
they're doing something about the addictiveness of
their products, oh, no, they are doing all kinds
of things to try to reduce risk, but they don't

THE COURT:
MR. OLIVER:
Five minutes, counsel.
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, it has been an honor to participate in this
process with you.
You know, the founding partner
of my law firm used to tell juries that what they
did will live forever in the halls of justice.
And when I first heard that, I thought it sounded
incredibly corny and then somebody explained it to
me.
You see, when we are done here, you guys are
going to go home and go back to your lives and
you'll probably -- this is interesting, but you'll
forget about it at some point.
And I do this all
I'm an attorney, so it's my job and,
the time.
you know, I'll go on to the next task, but for
Trudy Marchese and Trudy Marchese's family, this
Whatever happens here
is going to live forever. 02:41
02:41
02:41
02:41
02:41
02:41
02:41
02:41
02:41
02:42
02:42 4033
lives forever.
And for this county, for this hall
of justice, your verdict is going to stand and it
will be here forever.
People will be able to know
that justice was done or not done in this
courtroom during this trial.
Philip Morris and Reynolds have
opportunity after opportunity for 45 years to do
the right thing and they chose not to and they are
here trying to get out of it.
And they don't want
take responsibility for their actions, they want
to lay that responsibility at the feet of a
14-year-old kid that they hooked.
not to let them do it.
I'm asking you
Thanks.


MR. OLIVER:
Shall I proceed, your Honor?
Yes, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, let me be clear about one thing from the
beginning of my rebuttal closing and that is this:
The instructions say you're not supposed to make a
decision based on sympathy.
And I'm not asking 04:54
04:54
04:54
04:54
04:54
04:54
04:54
04:54
04:54
04:55
04:55
04:55
04:55
04:55
04:55
04:55 4127
And I made that clear when I stood up
you for sympathy, I'm asking for fairness and
justice.
during voir dire and I said there's a burden and I
have to meet it, and I made it clear that if I
don't meet that burden, then you don't find for
me.
It is incorrect as a matter of
So, when they talk about sympathy and they
act like I'm trying to pull on the heartstrings,
that is wrong.
Because
fact, it's incorrect as a matter of law.
the law says that when you make a product that's
deadly and kills people, those people can come
into court and they can seek compensation.
This case is not about those people who
have quit; Sal Marchese never did quit.
It's not
about those people who smoked for some period of
time, even a long period of time, and did not get
a disease because Sal Marchese did get a disease.
If somebody comes to my office and they say I
don't have lung cancer, I don't have COPD, I've
smoked for 20 years, can I bring a lawsuit.
do you think I'm going to say?
bring a lawsuit because you're not hurt.
Yeah,
they did some bad things, but those bad things
they did, they haven't hurt you yet, but they did
No, you can't
What 04:55
04:55
04:55

04:55
04:55
04:55
04:55
04:55 04:56 4128
hurt Mr. Marchese.
And Mr. Isasi said that there were some
things that happened 50 years ago; those things
were during Mr. Marchese's lifetime.
If you look
at the punitive damages instruction, in fact, Mr.
Isasi held up a board, what does this have to do
with Mr. Marchese.
Marchese and that's when he lived.
Well, this is about Mr.
If you look at the punitive damages
instruction, it says that you must punish them for
things that are linked to Mr. Marchese and it says
that if you find that we've met our burden, that
you can punish to deter others.
It's not just
about deterring them from doing the same thing,
it's about deterring other companies who would do
the same thing in the same circumstances.
But not only that, think about it, have

honest, that's a joke.
and he said that when they got involved in the
Tobacco Working Group, they wouldn't even admit --
they sent a letter and they said we won't admit
that this causes cancer and we won't call this a
safer cigarette because we don't want to admit
Dr. Proctor explained that 04:56 04:56
04:56 04:57
04:57
04:57 4129
that our cigarettes are doing anything bad now.
Okay.
That's a joke.
The Tobacco Working Group was disbanded,
Dr. Proctor told us about that, because it wasn't
successful.
And the tobacco companies didn't go
after their customers, Reynolds didn't, Philip
Morris didn't and say, hey, guys, we can't make a

filters and made light cigarettes and kept doing
the exact same things that they had been doing for
years.
So when you hear those things, think about
what Reynolds lawyer told you, what does it have
to do with Mr. Marchese.
Those bad things that
happened a long time ago hurt Mr. Marchese.
Now they talked a lot about different
things in Mr. Marchese's life, but what they can't
with to talk about was when he started smoking
because it's clear that he didn't know what was
going on and that they did create that environment
and that they did put that first cigarette in his
hand.
You know what else they didn't talk about.
You didn't hear one word about the most important
thing in this whole case and that's this 04:57
04:57
04:57
04:57
04:57
04:57
04:57 04:58

Of all the things that got to

Mr. Marchese, this is what they make, right?

The most important communication
that Kraft has with me is the cheese that I eat

We
The most important communication that the
Defendants had with Mr. Marchese was this product.
And we've told you and we showed you documents,
Dr. Proctor gave you an explanation of what they
were doing with those products, that they knew
exactly to the milligram how much nicotine
somebody needed.
And that when the market for cigarettes
changed and went to a low tar market and that was
part of the public health scare, that the
Defendants were looking for a way to get the same
nicotine kick by manipulating the pH of the
cigarette that they got in the past from a full
flavor cigarette, one that delivered more tar,
which is more carcinogens.

They were looking for

those cigarettes and that's why they didn't want
to talk about it.
They wanted to act like this
never touched Mr. Marchese, but they touched Mr.
Marchese 60 times a day every time he smoked one
of their products.
Now let's talk about comparative fault.
Instruction number 8 says the Defendants have
brought an affirmative defense and that's
comparative fault and that they bear the burden on
that particular issue.
So, when Mr. Cofer was
talking about what to write in there, he said
write 100 percent on Sal Marchese.
You've got to ask yourself, in the
circumstances what did Mr. Marchese do, did he do

just what I came up with, all right?
But I thought about a car when I was
sitting there and a car is a great example because
in order for me -- if I get in a car wreck and I

Dr. Gravelyn wasn't here to diagnose him.
Dr. Gravelyn was here to tell us that, as a
medical doctor, based on evidence he sees, there
was sufficient evidence for him to be very
confident that there was a diagnosis of COPD.
Medical records said COPD, the billing codes said
that a pre and post bronchodilator spirometry was
performed.
And Dr. Saltzman didn't have a great
memory, but he sure said, you know, it's my

fact that Mr. Marchese was in a coma and they make
it seem like that, in addition to being in a coma,
he was also in a smoking cessation group, right.
He was in a coma and there was a smoking cessation
counselor there, and for two months, they had the
discussion about how we need to deal with this.
