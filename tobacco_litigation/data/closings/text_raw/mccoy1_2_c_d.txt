11              MR. FURR:  Thank you.
12              May it please the Court.
13              Counsel, Mr. McCoy.
14              Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
15              JURORS:  Good morning.
16              MR. FURR:  I will move this stool.  With
17        my knees, I don't think I could step up on it
18        anyway.
19              When you get back in the jury room, you
20        will have a copy of your legal instructions
21        with you.  It was read to you about two days
22        ago now.  Please, please read those legal
23        instructions before you begin deliberating.
24              Because all that we ask of you in this
25        phase is that your deliberations and your verdict be guided by the rules of law that, of
2        course, you swore to apply when you were sworn
3        in as jurors, and your common sense.  That's
4        all we ask of you.
5              Because you -- when you read the legal
6        instructions, you will see that there are a set
7        of legal principles embedded in those
8        instructions that will demonstrate to you that
9        the law does not support a punitive damage
10        award in this case anywhere near the excessive
11        demand that was just made here.  The request
12        that was made here.  The law simply doesn't
13        support anything like that.
14              So I'm going to spend some time with you
15        on those legal instructions, because that's
16        something that was not done in the argument you
17        just heard.
18              I'm going to spend some time
19        demonstrating those legal instructions just
20        like I did in opening statement.
21              Really, if you put them all together, you
22        create sort of a funnel, because layer after
23        layer of the instructions demonstrate to you
24        that the question that you have to answer in
25        this phase of trial is much narrower than what was just suggested to you.
2              So I will review those instructions with
3        you, and then I'll talk about the evidence
4        that's been introduced in this phase with
5        respect to those instructions and the legal
6        principles that are supposed to guide your
7        deliberations.
8 Your Honor, can I just
9        interrupt and approach really quick on one
10        point?
11              THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
[#DELETED RECESS#]
6              MR. FURR:  Here is a perfect example of
7        why I'm suggesting to you to read your
8        instructions before you begin deliberations.
9              It was argued to you this morning that
10        you have already decided that punitive damages
11        will be awarded in this case.
12              In fact, when you read your instructions,
13        you're going to see that that's a question that
14        you are instructed to consider again during
15        this phase.
16              You will see on page 1 right in the
17        middle of the page, this instruction:  That you
18        will now decide the amount of punitive damages,
19        if any, to be assessed against the defendants.
20              And the reason, as we talked about during
21        opening statement, is that the instructions
22        also tell you that you may, in your discretion,
23        decline to assess punitive damages.
24              You see that, it's the first sentence on
25        the top of page 2 of your instructions. And why is that?  That's because in this
2        phase, you do have different legal principles
3        that you are to use in making a decision, and
4        you have seen new witnesses, and you have got
5        new evidence.
6              Now, I suggested this morning that I did
7        not bring you any new evidence in this phase,
8        and that all we did was rehash the evidence of
9        Phase I.
10              But think how much you know now about how
11        R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard and Philip Morris, for
12        that matter, conduct business today that you
13        did not know at the end of Phase I.
14              We spent two days presenting that
15        evidence to you.
16              You know, Mr. Schlesinger, during his
17        argument, suggested to you that you were part
18        of a transgenerational campaign against the
19        tobacco companies, and this was a verdict that
20        would be important in the war on tobacco
21        companies.
22              But the fact of the matter is, when you
23        boil this all down, this phase of this trial is
24        really nothing more than a request by Mr. McCoy
25        that you award him additional money. Because the only person that you can
2        award punitive damages to is Mr. McCoy.  I am
3        not saying anything negative about Mr. McCoy.
4        I hope we treated him with respect and dignity
5        during the first phase.  I certainly intend to
6        in this phase.  Never said anything negative
7        about him, never will say anything negative
8        about Mr. McCoy.
9              But it is important for you as you decide
10        what is the right thing to do in this phase, is
11        for you to understand where any award of
12        punitive damages that you make goes to.
13              Because it does go to Mr. McCoy.  It
14        can't go to public health agencies or smoking
15        cessation clinics or charities or other
16        smokers.  We will revisit this.
17              But you heard there are 3100 other
18        smokers in the state of Florida alone bringing
19        these Engle cases.  They have their chance to
20        seek compensatory damages and punitive damages.
21              This is really a pretty narrow case.
22        It's about whether, and if so, how much
23        additional money to award to Mr. McCoy.  It's
24        really nothing more, nothing less than
25        Mr. McCoy's request for additional money. The instructions will also tell you,
2        remind you on page 1 that any amount that you
3        award in this case is in addition to
4        compensatory damages you have already awarded.
5              And the six of you unanimously agreed
6        that the right amount of money to compensate
7        Mr. McCoy for his loss was $1.5 million.
8              As Mr. Schlesinger suggested to you this
9        morning, that's a substantial amount of money.
10        $1.5 million is like making $100,000 a year for
11        15 straight years.  A substantial amount of
12        money.
13              Now, this morning you were asked to award
14        punitive damages 30 times what the amount of
15        compensatory damages you awarded.  Put that in
16        context.  That would be like making $100,000 a
17        year for 450 years in a row.
18 Objection, Judge.  This
19        is not an earnings basis, for punishment.
20              THE COURT:  Thank you.  This is argument,
21        Counsel.
22              Objection noted.  Overruled.
23              MR. FURR:  $100,000 a year for 450 years
24        is what that punitive damages award would be.
25        It's an excessive amount. And when you read your instructions, and
2        I hope when you are considering this evidence
3        and when you use your common sense, I hope that
4        you'll find that's an excessive amount, and
5        that no amount anywhere near that size of award
6        is justified in this case.
7              Again, narrowing the inquiry, funneling
8        this down to help you focus on the issue you
9        have to decide.
10              You will see on page 2 of your
11        instructions that punitive damages must be
12        based only on the specific conduct that you
13        found to cause Mrs. McCoy's death.
14              And you can't punish the defendants for
15        harm suffered by anyone other than Mrs. McCoy
16        in this phase.  They can bring their own cases.
17              Let's put all that together.  You will
18        see all this in your instructions, I hope, when
19        you read them, and you'll see that the claim
20        funnels down this way.
21              The defendants in this case can only be
22        punished for concealing the information and
23        agreeing to conceal information that was a
24        cause of Mrs. McCoy's death.
25              Of course, as you know, she stopped smoking in the 1990s, 1991 time frame.  So her
2        decision as to whether to smoke or not would no
3        longer have been affected after 1990 or 1991.
4 Objection, Judge.
5              THE COURT:  Overruled.
6              MR. FURR:  Because that's when she
7        stopped.
8              So any concealment or agreement to
9        conceal could not have been continued to affect
10        her smoking decision.  So you're really talking
11        about whether to punish offensive conduct that
12        ended about 25 years ago, in 1990, 1991.
13              As we talked about, you can't punish for
14        harm to other smokers.  You're entitled to
15        consider harm to other smokers in evaluating
16        the nature of the defendants' conduct.
17              But when it comes down to the time to
18        write down the amount of your verdict, if any,
19        at that point in time, it's only Mrs. McCoy's
20        injury that you can award punitive damages for.
21              The instructions also say that you
22        can't -- that only those intentional tort
23        claims, the concealment and the agreement to
24        conceal claim in this case are the only claims
25        that support an award of punitive damages; that the punitive damages awards cannot be based on
2        your finding with respect to negligence or your
3        finding with respect to strict liability or
4        product defect.
5              This morning, you heard an argument that
6        came very close to being a request that the
7        defendants go out of business, that they stop
8        making combustible cigarettes, that they
9        eliminate 90 percent of their business.
10              And you were encouraged to award an
11        amount of punitive damages that would send a
12        message to the defendants that they should stop
13        selling cigarettes that burn.
14              But you're going to see in your
15        instruction the following, on page 3 of your
16        instructions:  That the manufacture and sale of
17        cigarettes is a lawful activity protected by
18        federal law.  Therefore, you may not impose
19        punitive damages to punish a defendant for
20        simply manufacturing, selling, or advertising
21        cigarettes.
22              That's not the task before you.
23              The task before you is not to send a
24        message that encourages tobacco companies to
25        stop selling cigarettes that burn, because it's protected under federal law.
2              Dr. Proctor told you that the United
3        States Congress has determined that the sale of
4        cigarettes to adults should continue to be
5        legal in this country.
6              At the end of the first phase of the
7        case, you were given a couple more instructions
8        by the Court after some testimony was given,
9        some questions were asked.
10              The Court gave you a couple instructions,
11        and here they are.
12              One of them was that cigarette
13        advertisements from July 1, 1969 forward cannot
14        be the subject of any claim that advertising
15        undermined or neutralized the warnings or made
16        them less effective.
17              You just saw that type argument this
18        morning.  Mr. Schlesinger holding up the
19        magazines, showing you the pictures in the
20        magazine for those Camel ads.
21              And he said:  Right here is the warning.
22        He said:  Look at the real message that's being
23        sent here.  Look at the message that's being
24        sent here.  This ad is somehow overwhelming the
25        warning. That was the argument made to you.
2        That's not the law.
3              The law is that the cigarette
4        advertisements cannot support a claim that they
5        undermined or neutralized the warnings or made
6        them less effective.  That's just the law.
7              Furthermore, the Court told you that the
8        warning labels that are placed on cigarette
9        packs and advertisements by the defendants
10        comply with federal law.
11              The Court told you the defendants had no
12        obligation to place any additional warnings on
13        their cigarette packs and advertisements after
14        July 1st, 1969.
15              So all these arguments of warning doesn't
16        say this, the warning doesn't say that, it
17        should say this, it should say that.  That's
18        not relevant to your inquiry under the law,
19        because those warnings are adequate as a matter
20        of law.  The defendants don't have any legal
21        duty to place additional warnings on them.
22              Mr. Schlesinger made an argument to you
23        this morning that just because somebody -- that
24        if someone has done something wrongful in the
25        past, but they changed their ways, that doesn't mean they should not be punished for that past
2        conduct.
3              But again, respectfully, I would ask you
4        to look at your instructions.  You will see
5        this instruction on page 1:  You are entitled
6        to conclude that misconduct that occurred in
7        the distant past and involved actors who are no
8        longer associated with the defendant need not
9        be punished, or that it should be punished less
10        severely than recent misconduct.
11              It's sort of a fairness principle.  One
12        of the things you're going to need to ask
13        yourself if you decide a punitive damages award
14        is, who are you punishing?  Who are you
15        punishing?
16              Are you punishing the actors that were
17        involved in the conduct that you heard about in
18        Phase I, or are you punishing the current
19        employees of the company?
20              And you have to decide whether that's the
21        right thing to do.  Because this instruction is
22        especially appropriate for this case, because
23        you know -- you know Mr. Schlesinger said,
24        what's changed?
25              The answer is, everything has changed about the way the companies do business with
2        respect to this concealment and agreement to
3        conceal claim.  Everything has changed.  And
4        you know that.
5              You know that the companies entered a
6        voluntary Master Settlement Agreement over 15
7        years ago where they dissolved the
8        organizations that were claimed to be the arms
9        of the conspiracy by Dr. Proctor.
10              You know the Tobacco Institute is gone,
11        the Council for Tobacco Research is gone, the
12        Tobacco Industry Research Committee is gone;
13        all disbanded in the '90s.
14              The companies don't debate today whether
15        smoking is dangerous or not.  The companies
16        don't have anything -- don't have a campaign of
17        doubt to try to confuse smokers about the
18        dangers of smoking.  The companies don't fund
19        distraction research.  The TIRC is gone.  All
20        gone 15 years ago.
21              This morning, there was a lot of focus by
22        Mr. Schlesinger on the actors of the past, and
23        he pulled up that portrait of Claude Teague and
24        said some very -- there was some very heavy
25        criticism of Claude Teague and the memoranda that he wrote and the ideas that he had.
2              But, again, you can't punish Claude
3        Teague with a verdict in this case, because as
4        Dr. Proctor told you, probably not a single one
5        of the actors in the first phase of this case
6        works at a tobacco company anymore, and most of
7        them are not even alive.
8              You have heard Mr. Schlesinger say, may
9        he rest in peace about Claude Teague.  Claude
10        Teague is deceased.  Alan Rodgman, James
11        Johnston, that CEO, Ed Horrigan.  If that's who
12        you think should be punished, you could render
13        a verdict in this case.
14              You could take it down to 401 West Main
15        Street in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where
16        R.J. Reynolds is headquartered.  You could
17        knock on the door and say:  I'm here to punish
18        Claude Teague or Alan Rodgman or James
19        Johnston.  It's too late.  They're long gone.
20        You can't punish them with a verdict against
21        R.J. Reynolds in this case because they're
22        gone.
23              You would be punishing the current
24        employees, like Dr. Garner, who by the way, was
25        not present at Reynolds in the '80s.  You heard this yesterday.  He came to the company in
2        1995, after those Waxman hearings, not before
3        those Waxman hearings.
4              Dr. Garner is the type of person you
5        would be punishing.  You met Dr. Garner.  You
6        got to see his demeanor, you got to see his
7        integrity, certainly got to see his
8        understanding of the science and his grasp of
9        the principles related to developing less
10        hazardous cigarette products.
11              And you have to decide whether the work
12        that he and other scientists are doing and the
13        type of scientists that we have today are
14        people that you really want to punish for the
15        actions of people that are long gone.
16              The CEOs -- you've heard this before, I
17        won't belabor this -- they were all terminated
18        shortly after -- after they stood up and swore
19        that nicotine was not addictive, they were
20        gone, gone from the companies.
21 Objection.
22              MR. FURR:  Very shortly.
23              As Dr. Proctor told --
24              THE COURT:  What is the objection,
25        Counsel? SCHLESINGER:  Mischaracterizing the
2        evidence.  It's not the evidence.
3              THE COURT:  Objection noted.  It's
4        overruled.
5              Proceed.
6              MR. FURR:  Dr. Proctor told you they were
7        all terminated shortly after the hearing.
8              I kept returning to this, because it's
9        really important.  As we funnel this case down
10        to what it's really all about, it's about
11        whether to punish R.J. Reynolds for that
12        concealment of information and an agreement to
13        conceal information that last could have
14        injured Mrs. McCoy in 1990.
15              A large part of the proof that was
16        offered to you in this case were the documents,
17        the internal company documents that
18        Mr. Schlesinger and others described as the
19        secret documents.  Well, they are secret no
20        more.
21              As you know, there are no secret
22        documents now, because again, the past is gone
23        with respect to that issue also.
24              You heard yesterday that R.J. Reynolds'
25        website, a voluntary website that it maintains on rjrt.com so that the public can look at all
2        their documents, includes the documents from
3        R.J. Reynolds, American Tobacco, Brown &
4        Williamson and Lorillard, that they're
5        available to anyone in the world that has
6        access to the internet.
7              You could go on that website, as
8        explained to you, and put Claude Teague's name
9        in, and up come all of Dr. Teague's documents.
10        Anybody who wants to know what happened in the
11        past can do that.
12              You were told there were 17 million pages
13        that are word searchable on that database.
14        17 million pages would probably fill up this
15        courtroom.  It's all there.  There are no
16        secrets.  There is complete transparency with
17        respect to the documents.
18              Again, what's changed?  Everything has
19        changed.  You heard from Dr. Garner that around
20        the year 2000, R.J. Reynolds turned the corner,
21        they became a different type of tobacco
22        company.
23              It's important to think about -- they are
24        a tobacco company.  It's a controversial
25        segment of our economy.  No question about that.  But it's a legal segment of our economy.
2              And what you've heard is that
3        R.J. Reynolds now conducts itself as a
4        responsible company in what is -- we
5        acknowledge openly is a controversial industry.
6              But nonetheless, they turned the corner,
7        there is new ownership of the company, new
8        executives, new scientists; the past is just
9        gone.  So you have to decide -- really, one of
10        the critical questions you have to decide in
11        this case is this:  Are punitive damages needed
12        to prevent R.J. Reynolds -- and when I say
13        R.J. Reynolds, I'm speaking for Lorillard also,
14        I represent both companies.  Of course, we
15        talked about it, and we talked about this more.
16        Lorillard doesn't exist anymore.
17              R.J. Reynolds bought some of their
18        brands, sold some of their brands, but
19        Lorillard is gone.  There is no Lorillard
20        Tobacco Company.
21              But do you need to award punitive damages
22        in this case to prevent R.J. Reynolds from
23        concealing and agreeing to conceal information
24        in 2015?  And you know that the answer is no to
25        that. Again, going back to these critically
2        important legal instructions, you will see this
3        on page 3 of your instructions:  That you
4        should consider the extent the defendants'
5        conduct has changed, and that you should
6        consider how circumstances have changed.
7              Those are factors that the Court's
8        instructions tell you that you should consider
9        when you evaluate whether, and if so, how large
10        an award to make.
11              The concealment is over, the agreement to
12        conceal is over.  And instead of concealing,
13        R.J. Reynolds informs smokers about the dangers
14        of smoking today.
15              And you know that.  You know they do it
16        at least a couple different ways.  You know
17        that they have the website that we're going to
18        look at more closely.
19              The website provides smokers with a large
20        amount of information about the dangers of
21        smoking.
22              Well, this morning the argument was made
23        was that that somehow was hypocritical for
24        R.J. Reynolds to tell smokers that smoking is
25        dangerous today. Can you imagine what would be said if we
2        didn't do that?  If we didn't tell smokers on
3        our website about the dangers of our products?
4              But you also know that R.J. Reynolds goes
5        further.  You know that they've spent billions
6        of dollars trying to develop reduced risk
7        tobacco products.  And they've told the public
8        about those products.
9              Although they always prefaced all that by
10        saying:  There is no safe tobacco product.  If
11        you're concerned about the risk, what you
12        really should do is quit.  What you really
13        should do is quit.
14              Here is what Dr. Garner explained to you
15        yesterday.  Rather than conceal the dangers of
16        smoking, R.J. Reynolds tells smokers the
17        following:  Cigarette smoking is a leading
18        cause of preventible deaths in the United
19        States.
20              Cigarette smoking significantly increases
21        the risk of developing lung cancer, heart
22        disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and
23        other serious diseases, and adverse health
24        conditions.
25              Crystal clear, unambiguous, unequivocal acknowledgment of the dangers of smoking and
2        how those dangers can lead to premature death
3        and do lead to premature deaths.  A leading
4        cause of premature death in this country.
5        That's what R.J. Reynolds tells smokers today.
6              Are punitive damages needed to prevent
7        R.J. Reynolds from concealing the dangers of
8        smoking today?
9              But they go further.  This morning, you
10        heard this issue about ammonium-related
11        additives and why isn't that on the side of the
12        package, why don't they tell the smokers about
13        that.
14              Of course they do.  We talked about this
15        yesterday with Dr. Garner.  R.J. Reynolds also
16        has on its website a list of all the
17        ingredients that are used, and a list of all
18        the ingredients that are used in particular
19        brands.
20              I won't take the time to blow it up right
21        now, but you can see on the bottom of this
22        chart that the bottom additive listed is
23        di-ammonium phosphate and ammonium hydroxide.
24              Complete transparency.  Full disclosure
25        for any smoker who wants to know what type of additives are used in the brand I'm smoking can
2        get on the website and see exactly what goes in
3        their brand.
4              This is important, because we're going to
5        talk about the migration strategy and we're
6        going to talk about why it takes so long and
7        whether there's anything else that Reynolds
8        could do.
9              The most important thing is the migration
10        strategy is the secondary message that is sent
11        to smokers.
12              You visit R.J. Reynolds' website, and the
13        primary message sent to smokers is that
14        quitting smoking, quitting cigarette smoking
15        significantly reduces the risk for serious
16        diseases.
17              Again, unambiguous, crystal clear,
18        unequivocal message that if you are concerned
19        about the dangers of smoking, you should quit.
20        You should quit.
21              But R.J. Reynolds goes further, because
22        some smokers want to continue using tobacco
23        products.
24              So R.J. Reynolds tells those smokers that
25        in making those decisions, the company believes that individuals should rely on the conclusions
2        of the Surgeon General and Centers for Disease
3        Control and other public health and medical
4        officials when making decisions regarding
5        smoking.
6              Now, part of the evidence that you heard
7        about in the first phase was that R.J. Reynolds
8        would attack reports to the Surgeon General,
9        that would attempt to claim that some of the
10        findings being made by Surgeon Generals were
11        invalid or being made for improper motives.
12              It's all gone.  No more of that.  Now
13        that the company has backed out of the debate,
14        they don't engage anybody about smoking not
15        being dangerous.  Instead, they tell smokers,
16        don't even look to us, look to the public
17        health authorities.  Look to the Surgeon
18        General.
19              And by the way, to make it easy for you,
20        here is a link.  Click on this link right here,
21        and it -- all the information you want is right
22        here.  All of the information in all these
23        reports that you've heard so much about.  Right
24        there on R.J. Reynolds' website.  They link to
25        those reports, so that anybody who wants to has access to the information.  Complete
2        transparency.
3              But for smokers who nonetheless make the
4        decision that they want to continue using a
5        tobacco product, R.J. Reynolds informs those
6        smokers about the availability of reduced risk
7        products.
8              The migration strategy, to try to move
9        smokers down the continuum of risk that we've
10        talked about several times.
11              R.J. Reynolds has this diagram that
12        demonstrates to smokers that cigarettes are the
13        most dangerous form of tobacco use.  That
14        smokeless tobacco is less dangerous, nicotine
15        products are yet less dangerous, and that blue
16        arrow shows smokers that switching downstream
17        on this continuum of risk will reduce their
18        risk of developing chronic diseases.
19              Okay.  Dr. Proctor told you that the only
20        true cigarette is the one you don't smoke.  And
21        this morning, it was argued to you that somehow
22        the defendants should be punished, because they
23        haven't come up with a safe cigarette.
24              That's because, as you heard yesterday,
25        no one knows how to make a safe cigarette.  No one knows how to do it yet.  Despite the
2        billions of dollars and decades of work that
3        have been done, nobody knows how to make a safe
4        cigarette.
5              And Dr. Proctor candidly acknowledges you
6        can't make them safe.  The only one safe is the
7        one you don't smoke.
8              R.J. Reynolds tells smokers that.
9        R.J. Reynolds tells smokers no tobacco product
10        has been shown to be safe and without risks.
11              So while R.J. Reynolds provides both
12        sides of the story, they provide the smokers
13        information about how they can switch down the
14        continuum of risk and face lower risk.
15              They are very clear in telling smokers
16        that no tobacco product is safe and without
17        risk.
18              Here is exactly what they tell them on
19        the website:  The best course of action for
20        tobacco consumers concerned about their health
21        is to quit.  Primary message, quit.
22              Secondary message.  Adults who continue
23        to use tobacco products should consider the
24        reduction of risks for serious diseases
25        associated with moving from cigarette products to the use of smoke-free tobacco or nicotine
2        products.
3              In the diagram we just looked at, they
4        show that how by doing so you can go down that
5        continuum of risk and decrease the risk that
6        you are facing.
7              Why has R.J. Reynolds taken the approach
8        of trying to move people away from combustible
9        products, the cigarettes that burn?
10              Why have they tried to move people down
11        this risk continuum away from combustible
12        products, as opposed to just taking the
13        nicotine out?
14              Because really, a lot of the argument you
15        heard this morning was they should simply take
16        the nicotine out.  Well, here's why.
17              I don't know if you recall, but that
18        portion of the Surgeon General's Report that
19        Mr. Schlesinger had up on the screen actually
20        addressed how the dangers of smoking could be
21        diminished by moving smokers away from
22        combustible cigarette products.
23              And Dr. Proctor, their witness, told you
24        the same thing.
25              Dr. Proctor told you that the combustion of tobacco is the dividing line, the rubicon
2        between something that is safe and not safe.
3              He specifically said:  Combustion is what
4        produces most of the harm.  Combustion is what
5        produces most of the harm.
6              That's why the migration strategy is in
7        place.
8              Menthol.  Let's talk about menthol just a
9        minute before we go back to migration strategy.
10        Again, this whole issue that somehow selling a
11        menthol cigarette product is inconsistent with
12        migration strategy.
13              Here is the evidence that you have on
14        menthol from Dr. Proctor.  It's not addictive.
15        Menthol smokers do not smoke more, and they're
16        not more addicted than other smokers.  It's not
17        a carcinogen.
18              And he told you in the first phase of
19        this trial that puff for puff, menthol
20        cigarettes are no more dangerous for lung
21        cancer than regular smokers.  That was his
22        testimony.
23              But you don't want to get too distracted
24        by issues like that, because what are we here
25        for.  You're here for the decision of whether R.J. Reynolds should be punished.  And if so,
2        how much for concealing information and
3        agreeing to conceal information that was a
4        cause of Mrs. McCoy's death.
5              But what does menthol have to do with
6        Mrs. McCoy?  Because the evidence in the first
7        phase was that Mrs. McCoy didn't like menthol
8        cigarettes.
9              You might remember they cross-examined
10        Mr. McCoy who said, yeah, she tried them.  She
11        didn't like them and immediately went back to
12        non-menthol cigarettes.
13              Doesn't have anything to do with it.
14              I want to go back to this issue, though,
15        of the migration strategy.  Here is what you
16        were told about nicotine.  First, you were told
17        that the FDA has the authority to reduce
18        nicotine to nonaddictive levels.  The FDA can
19        do that.
20              But you're also told that there is no
21        public health consensus that reducing nicotine
22        makes cigarettes less addictive and dangerous.
23              You also now know that --
24 Objection, Judge,
25        misstates the evidence in the case. THE COURT:  Thank you.
2              Ladies and gentlemen, you rely on your
3        own recollection of the evidence.
4              Proceed, Counsel.
5              MR. FURR:  In fact, what you saw
6        demonstrated by Dr. Garner is that nicotine is
7        key to the reduced risk tobacco products,
8        because all of those reduced risk tobacco
9        products that you saw, they were all efforts to
10        continue providing the nicotine, but getting
11        rid of the tar and the carcinogens and the
12        harmful constituents to create a safer product.
13              And plaintiff's own witnesses told you
14        that that works, and that these products are
15        safer.
16              Here is what you were told about
17        combustible products.  This is why Reynolds
18        decided to move to trying to develop
19        noncombustible cigarette products; in other
20        words, that heat-but-not-burn technology.
21              You now know, because Dr. Proctor told
22        you, that Premier was less harmful than
23        traditional cigarettes that burn tobacco, but
24        you now know also how hard Reynolds has worked
25        on it. You know they began working to develop
2        heat-but-not-burn technology in the 1980s,
3        continued in the '90s, spent a billion dollars
4        on it.  It was novel, creative, difficult work.
5        They were awarded over 40 to 50 patents for the
6        work.
7              You might remember the goals of that
8        technology were to reduce biological activity,
9        reduce smoke chemistry and reduce secondhand
10        smoke, and Reynolds achieved all those things.
11        All those things were accomplished through
12        Premier.
13              You saw those charts we put up yesterday
14        where the chemistry of the Premier smoke was
15        for most constituents in the range of 80 to
16        95 percent decreased from the chemistry of
17        tobacco-burning cigarettes.
18              But Premier was in the test market, and
19        it failed because customers rejected the
20        protect due to its taste.
21              So while R.J. Reynolds was successful in
22        achieving the other three goals for the
23        product, they forgot something important, to
24        make a product that people liked.  Because if
25        people don't like it and won't switch to it, it's not going to do anybody any good.  Keep
2        smoking dangerous cigarettes.
3              After a decade of work, spending a
4        billion dollars, R.J. Reynolds didn't quit,
5        though.  They failed.  They took it back in the
6        laboratory.  They retooled it as Eclipse.
7              You heard from Dr. Proctor and Dr. Garner
8        that that was R.J. Reynolds' second attempt to
9        develop a heat-but-not-burn cigarette.
10              Again, the goals were lower biological
11        activity, reduce smoke chemistry, reduce
12        secondhand smoke.
13              But this time, they remembered they also
14        had to try to create a product that tasted good
15        and that smokers would like and switch to from
16        combustible products.
17              Again, well over a billion dollars was
18        spent.  The product is marketed nationally,
19        including here in Florida.  It's on the market,
20        but so few people buy it that R.J. Reynolds
21        loses money on every pack of cigarettes of
22        Eclipse that sells.
23              But, nonetheless, it keeps those packs on
24        the market so that the smoker who wants to
25        switch down that continuum of risk has the Eclipse cigarette as an option that they can go
2        to.
3              But they didn't stop there.  Because if
4        we go back to this continuum, we see that
5        smokeless products are also a way to decrease
6        the risk of using tobacco.
7              So what did R.J. Reynolds do?  It studied
8        smokeless products and studied snus in
9        particular that had been demonstrated -- as
10        Dr. Garner explained to you yesterday, it's a
11        smokeless product.  You don't inhale it --
12        thank you very much -- so there's no risk of
13        lung cancer and there's no risk of emphysema.
14              It's not safe.  It can cause mouth
15        cancer.  But those two leading causes of
16        morbidity and mortality from smoking
17        cigarettes, lung cancer and emphysema, that
18        risk is eliminated by snus.
19              It's sold nationally.  But it does carry
20        warning labels.  You saw them yesterday.  It
21        includes cancer and addiction.
22              But it's part of the migration strategy.
23        Yet again, if someone wants to keep using a
24        tobacco product that has nicotine in it, but
25        would like something that's less risky to use, then a combustible cigarette that you inhale,
2        this is on the market that is an option for
3        smokers.
4              They didn't stop there either.  You now
5        know that R.J. Reynolds also has an e-cigarette
6        calls Vuse, an e-cigarette.
7              You saw yesterday when we put up those
8        charts of the comparisons that the chemistry of
9        the e-cigarette is even simpler than Eclipse
10        and simpler than Premier, that for almost all
11        the important constituents, it was over
12        99 percent reduction in the smoke chemistry.
13              Dr. Garner explained to you that it
14        virtually eliminates compounds, like
15        acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, that there had
16        been tests performed on smokers.  This was in
17        response to your question yesterday.
18              Dr. Garner explained that the blood tests
19        for smokers demonstrate that smokers of Vuse
20        have less nicotine in their body than smokers
21        of combustible cigarettes.
22              You've heard this product has been
23        subjected to the product stewardship program at
24        R.J. Reynolds to make sure the company is not
25        doing anything in the development of materials or the manufacture of the product that could
2        make it more dangerous.
3              And you've heard that Reynolds has made a
4        significant commitment to developing yet
5        another option down that continuum of risk for
6        smokers who want to switch.  And to date, they
7        have spent $500 million developing this
8        product.
9              And Dr. Garner proudly told you that when
10        they purchased Lorillard, they had the option
11        to keep Blu or to keep Vuse.  They chose to
12        keep Vuse, because they thought it was a better
13        product.
14              And Dr. Garner also told you that, in
15        fact, the product is doing very well nationally
16        and its market share is growing.  That's what
17        you were told.
18              Moreover, is a punitive damages award
19        needed to make R.J. Reynolds disclose the
20        dangers of these products?
21              You heard with regard to Vuse,
22        R.J. Reynolds has put a voluntary warning
23        label.  Not required by the FDA, the United
24        States Congress or anybody else.
25              R.J. Reynolds voluntarily put this warning label on Vuse that says:  Vuse is a
2        tobacco product, because of nicotine used in
3        the product that's extracted from the tobacco
4        plant.  No tobacco product has been shown to be
5        safe and without risk.  This product contains
6        nicotine, which is addictive, et cetera.
7              Voluntarily telling people considering
8        using Vuse, the product is both addictive and
9        we can't tell you it's safe and without risk.
10              Dr. Garner offered you his opinion as a
11        toxicologist why it would be much, much safer
12        than tobacco-burning cigarettes.
13              But they can't tell people that.
14        Instead, they tell them it's addictive and can
15        be dangerous.
16              So with respect to this migration
17        strategy, as Dr. Garner explained to you, not
18        in the truncated quote you were shown, but in
19        his full answer, he explained to you that it
20        takes time to get the public to switch from
21        combustible cigarettes down to noncombustible
22        cigarettes or to smokeless or to a nicotine
23        product, like Vuse.
24              I asked him, I said:  What would happen
25        if R.J. Reynolds simply started making the combustible cigarettes?
2              His answer was, as you might have guessed
3        it, the expectation would be that smokers would
4        simply move and start buying cigarettes from
5        another manufacturer, from another
6        manufacturer.
7              Again, it's not about forcing
8        R.J. Reynolds to stop making combustible
9        cigarettes.
10              And the real question is, what more could
11        R.J. Reynolds do?  They've worked for 30 years,
12        they've developed the heat-but-not-burn
13        technology, they have developed a smokeless
14        technology, the nicotine, they've spent a
15        couple billion.
16              Dr. Proctor freely acknowledges that
17        R.J. Reynolds had spent a fortune trying to
18        make cigarettes safer.  It's not over.  It's
19        not over yet.  R.J. Reynolds is not done.
20              Yesterday, Dr. Garner told you there are
21        literally hundreds of Reynolds employees hard
22        at work on reduced risk tobacco products.
23        Hundreds of employees.
24              Has Reynolds concealed the dangers of
25        smoking today?  Is Reynolds part of any agreement to seal the dangers of smoking?  Of
2        course not.
3              One of the important ways that they
4        inform smokers in 2015 is not only do they show
5        them what the continuum of risk is and how
6        moving down that continuum of risk to decrease
7        somebody's risk from a tobacco product.
8              But they put their money where their
9        mouth is.  They put their money where their
10        mouth is.  They spend a lot of money developing
11        products to put in each of these categories so
12        that a tobacco user concerned about their
13        health can move down and take less risk if
14        that's what they want to do.
15              R.J. Reynolds goes farther on its
16        website.  You know, there was a lot of
17        discussion this morning about the number of
18        people still smoking and about youth smoking
19        and the number of underaged smokers that start
20        every day.  And the underage smokers -- Surgeon
21        General's quotes about underage smokers.
22              Let's put this in a little context.
23        First, let's look at what R.J. Reynolds tells
24        people.
25              R.J. Reynolds says on its website that minors should never use tobacco products, and
2        adults who do not use or have quit using
3        tobacco products should not start.  Should not
4        start.
5              Somebody's listening.  The suggestion is
6        nobody is going to the website.  Somebody is
7        listening, because here is what Dr. Garner told
8        you yesterday.
9              He told you that smoking prevalence in
10        this country has decreased from 25 percent in
11        1995 to 16 percent.  Decreased by a third in
12        the 20 years between 1995 and 2015, and that
13        Reynolds sells less than -- although the
14        smoking prevalence is going down by a third,
15        the number of cigarettes that Reynolds sells
16        has decreased by two-thirds since 1996.  And
17        that Reynolds sells less than one-third as many
18        cigarettes today as it did in 1996.
19              And it was argued to this morning that if
20        we put Lorillard back in, Reynolds would be
21        selling more cigarettes again.
22              But you also heard that Reynolds has
23        divested itself of some of those brands, and we
24        don't know what's going to happen in the
25        future.  But you can't just add those numbers together.
2              What about youth?  You know, a lot of the
3        evidence that you got about youth marketing
4        consisted simply of reading to you excerpts
5        from the Surgeon General's Report.
6              Plaintiffs are entitled to do that in
7        this case.  But what doesn't happen when they
8        read excerpts.  I can't cross-examine a book.
9        I don't get to ask the book additional
10        questions to try to put what the book is saying
11        in context.
12              But then Dr. Proctor came, and we were
13        able to put current youth smoking in context.
14        Notwithstanding all those quotations that were
15        read to you from the Surgeon General's Report,
16        Dr. Proctor, who you know is a contributor to
17        the Surgeon General's reports, told you the
18        following things when I had a chance to ask him
19        cross-examination questions to bring out the
20        fuller context.
21              He told you that youth smoking is at an
22        all-time low in this country today, and that
23        the rates are the lowest they have been since
24        the 1920s, and they're also dropping like a
25        rock. Because here is what else Dr. Proctor
2        told you.  The rates have fallen dramatically
3        in the last 18 years; that it's decreased by
4        two-thirds since 1996.  That trend has
5        accelerated.
6              Dr. Proctor told you in Phase I that
7        youth smoking rates have decreased by
8        25 percent in the last four years alone, and
9        today cigarette smoking by youth has become so
10        stigmatized that teenagers are more likely to
11        smoke marijuana than cigarettes today.
12              All things that Dr. Proctor conceded on
13        cross-examination.
14              So, again, for context, can't
15        cross-examine a book.  But when a live witness
16        comes and you have a chance to ask that witness
17        questions, you can bring out the other side of
18        the story to give you all a fuller context of
19        what is going on.
20              Mitigating evidence.  Very important
21        instruction.  You'll see it right at the bottom
22        of page 1 of your instruction.  You will see
23        this.
24              Mitigating evidence is evidence which may
25        demonstrate that there's no need for punitive damages or that a reduced amount of punitive
2        damages should be imposed.
3              I'm going to focus on four types of
4        mitigating evidence that you got during this
5        phase of the trial.
6              First, Reynolds has paid its debt to
7        society and will continue paying its debt to
8        society.
9              You heard about -- well, I'm sorry, skip
10        the one.
11              I'm going to talk about other pending
12        cases.  I'm going to talk about the Master
13        Settlement Agreement, the Florida settlement
14        agreement, and the FDA regulation, which I
15        suggest to you are all mitigating evidence that
16        you're entitled to consider in this phase.
17              Now, as I said, Reynolds has paid and
18        will pay forever its debt to society under the
19        Master Settlement Agreement.
20              This voluntary agreement that the
21        cigarette manufacturers entered into carries
22        with it substantial financial obligations for
23        the companies.  And since the Master Settlement
24        Agreement was entered in the late '90s,
25        R.J. Reynolds has already paid $42 billion to the states.
2              A separate settlement agreement was
3        entered into with the State of Florida.
4        R.J. Reynolds has already paid to the State of
5        Florida $2 billion, and these payments go on in
6        perpetuity.  They never end.
7              As long as the company is in business
8        making and selling cigarettes, they will be
9        making these payments to the states.  They have
10        paid their debt to society.
11              Let's talk about FDA regulation.  It's
12        been ridiculed, but the fact of the matter
13        is --
14 I move to strike "pay
15        debt to society."  That's not the law in this
16        case --
17              THE COURT:  Sustained.
18 -- the issue in this
19        case.  Move to strike.
20              THE COURT:  Jurors disregard.
21              MR. FURR:  The fact of the matter is that
22        R.J. Reynolds -- the public health is protected
23        with respect to tobacco products by the FDA.
24              You've heard this over and over, I won't
25        belabor it, but the FDA has regulated the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco
2        products since 2009.
3              And, again, reminding ourselves why we
4        are here, why we are here, to decide whether
5        R.J. Reynolds should be punished based on the
6        concealment and agreement to conceal that
7        injured Mrs. McCoy.
8              It's important to look at what the FDA
9        has done with respect to making -- to making
10        sure that all the information that the tobacco
11        manufacturers had about their products and its
12        dangers are in the public domain and can be
13        used to shape public health.
14              And here is one thing Dr. Garner was not
15        cross-examined about.  He told you that there's
16        complete transparency with the FDA; that the
17        disclosure requirements require the companies
18        to produce to them any research related to
19        smoking and health, smoking and addiction, the
20        recipe of the cigarette, including all
21        ingredients, the content of delivery of
22        nicotine in every product, including any free
23        nicotine in the product, and the quantities of
24        carcinogens and other harmful constituents in
25        tobacco products and tobacco smoke. All produced to the FDA.  No
2        cross-examination on any of that.
3              Not only that, as Mr. Schlesinger pointed
4        out this morning, the tobacco industry is in a
5        unique position of having to pay the FDA to
6        police them.
7              Taxpayers don't pay for it.  The tobacco
8        companies fund the FDA and its employees and
9        its work through payments they make annually to
10        the FDA.
11              Dr. Garner explained to you that millions
12        of pages have been produced already.
13              But here is what R.J. Reynolds has to do.
14        They are called user fees.  R.J. Reynolds has
15        already paid $565 million to the FDA.
16              And these payments will continue, again,
17        in perpetuity.  As long as R.J. Reynolds is in
18        business, they will be making these payments to
19        the FDA.  They will be paying the policemen to
20        police their work.
21              Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest to you
22        that there is no need for punitive damages in
23        this case.  The concealment is over.  The
24        agreement to conceal is over.
25              There's significant lines of mitigating evidence in this case, and I suggest to you,
2        there's really no useful purpose served by
3        making a punitive damages award in this case,
4        and we would ask you to consider this.
5              When you consider this issue about
6        whether punitive damages are needed to prevent
7        Reynolds from concealing information in 2015,
8        the answer is no.
9              The bottom line answer is no, that no
10        further punishment is necessary in this case.
11              Now, why do I say further punishment?  I
12        say further punishment.  Because as you were
13        told in your instructions -- again, you will
14        see this on page 3 of your instruction, you
15        will see that you should not award punitive
16        damages if you conclude that those purposes
17        will be satisfied by defendants' compensatory
18        liability.
19              So although that was compensatory to
20        Mr. McCoy, the instructions made it clear that
21        it has the effect of being punitive to the
22        defendants to have to make those payments.
23              And you are instructed -- you should
24        consider whether that's enough punishment.  I
25        suggest to you that it is. I want to talk to you about that verdict
2        for a minute to make sure you're clear about
3        something, and that is you awarded $1.5 million
4        to Mr. McCoy in the first phase.
5              You also found Mrs. McCoy to be 35
6        percent responsible.  But because of other
7        findings that you made on your verdict form,
8        that $525,000 that would have represented the
9        35 percent will, in fact, be paid to Mr. McCoy.
10        So he will receive the full $1.5 million.
11 I object, Judge.  This
12        is not a punitive damage argument.
13              THE COURT:  Sustained.
14              Rephrase, Counsel.
15              MR. FURR:  The bottom line is, that the
16        whole award goes to Mr. McCoy, and it's not
17        reduced for any comparative fault --
18 Same objection.
19              THE COURT:  Proceed, Counsel.
20              Overruled.
21              MR. FURR:  So when you consider whether
22        the award you made in the first phase serves
23        the effect of being enough punishment in this
24        case is the $1.5 million that he received.
25              Now, I want to talk about Reynolds and Lorillard.  They are both defendants in this
2        case.  There will be lines on the verdict form
3        for both of them.
4              But it is important to understand that
5        R.J. Reynolds will pay any compensatory
6        punitive damages award against Reynolds, but
7        R.J. Reynolds will also pay any compensatory
8        and punitive damage award against Lorillard.
9        Dr. Garner told you that yesterday.
10              So while you in this case have the
11        opportunity to award damages against both, it
12        might be important to you to understand there's
13        only one checkbook.  There's only one
14        checkbook, and that's R.J. Reynolds' checkbook.
15        There is no Lorillard checkbook at all.
16              If you decide, however, to go forward and
17        make a punitive damages award, I want to review
18        just a couple things with you about how you
19        might think about what the size of that
20        punitive damages award would be.
21              Thank you, Jason.
22              And you get this guidance.  Here is the
23        guidance that you get in your jury instructions
24        as to how the punitive damages award should be
25        related to the compensatory award that you made.
2              You see on page 3 this instruction:  Any
3        amount of punitive damages you award must bear
4        a reasonable relationship to the amount of
5        compensatory damages which you have awarded to
6        the plaintiff.
7              So this compensatory award is an
8        important part of the calculus for you as you
9        evaluate what size punitive award to make, if
10        you choose to make one.
11              And I'm going to suggest to you a range
12        of numbers that would bear a reasonable
13        relationship to the compensatory award you've
14        made.
15              And that's this.  I suggest to you that
16        if you're going to award punitive damages
17        against R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard, that you
18        should make a combined award.  Not for each of
19        them, but a combined award somewhere in the
20        range of $250,000 to $500,000.
21              When you add that to the compensatory
22        award that you have already made in this case,
23        that would then be an award to Mr. McCoy of a
24        total of about $1.75 million to $2 million, a
25        very substantial amount of money.  A substantial amount of money.
2              Anything greater than $500,000, ladies
3        and gentlemen, would be excessive.  Would be an
4        excessive award in this case.
5              I want to go back to something
6        Mr. Schlesinger said.  He used this analogy
7        multiple times today, about putting another
8        strap across Gulliver's chest and how this case
9        will work with all the other cases with respect
10        to the net effect that this litigation has on
11        R.J. Reynolds.
12              So let's think about what that means.
13        There are 3100 cases pending.  If an award of
14        $500,000, which I suggest to you is the upper
15        range of a reasonable punitive damage award in
16        this case, if that were made in all 31 --
17 Objection, Judge.
18              THE COURT:  Thank you.
19              Objection noted.  It's overruled.
20              MR. FURR:  If that were made in all 3100
21        pending cases, the total amount, the total
22        amount of that award would be $1.55 billion.
23        $1.55 billion.
24              Now, if you were to award the amount that
25        Mr. Schlesinger suggested to you of $45 -- let's just go with $10 million.  Because he
2        said $10 million is the lowest you should
3        award.
4              If you were to award $10 million in this
5        case and that same award was made in these
6        other 3100 cases, that amount would be
7        $31 billion.
8 Same objection,
9        Your Honor.  Calls for speculation, violates
10        the law on this.
11              THE COURT:  Thank you.
12              Proceed, Counsel.
13              MR. FURR:  $31 billion.  Clearly
14        excessive.
15              So when you consider what amount to award
16        in this case and you decide to make an award,
17        think about Mr. Schlesinger's analogy of this
18        case working in conjunction with all the others
19        to have a net effect on the defendant.  And
20        what would happen if the same amount of
21        punitive damages were awarded in all those
22        other cases.
23              What would happen, of course, is that you
24        would financially destroy the company.
25 Objection, Your Honor, move to strike.
2              THE COURT:  Thank you.
3              Jurors disregard the last comment.
4              MR. FURR:  You will see in your
5        instructions that you are instructed, you may
6        not award an amount that would financially
7        destroy Reynolds.  That's part of your
8        instructions.
9              So let me sum this up.
10              Mr. McCoy has been fully compensated by
11        $1.5 million.  Punitive damages are not needed
12        in this case to make R.J. Reynolds stop
13        concealing information.  And an award of over
14        $500,000 would simply be excessive in this case
15        when there are over 3100 other Engle cases
16        pending.
17              So that takes me back to where I started.
18        That is, you may in your discretion decline to
19        assess punitive damages, and we urge you to do
20        so.
21              One of the things we urge you to think
22        about is whether punitive damages will serve a
23        valid purpose in this case.
24              And when you think about that issue, here
25        are some questions you might ask yourself.  My suggestion is as to what those answers would
2        be.
3              Is a punitive award needed to make
4        Reynolds stop concealing information?  No.
5              Would a punitive award make people more
6        aware of the dangers of smoking?  Of course
7        not.
8              The Surgeon General websites -- you've
9        heard everyone understands the dangers of
10        smoking today.
11              Would a punitive damage award cause
12        smokers to change their behavior?  No.
13              Would it improve public health?  No.
14        That's what the FDA is responsible for.
15              Would a punitive award cause U.S.
16        Congress to reconsider the legality of
17        cigarettes?  Of course not.
18              Would a punitive damage award in this
19        case cause the FDA to change the way the FDA
20        regulates cigarettes?  Of course not.
21 Objection, Your Honor,
22        calls for speculation.
23              THE COURT:  Overruled.
24              MR. FURR:  Would a punitive damage award
25        in this case serve any valid purpose?  Of course not.
2              And punishment without purpose is just
3        revenge.  That's all it is.  Punishment without
4        purpose is just revenge.
5              Thank you.  You've been very patient for
6        me.  This is the last time I get to talk with
7        you.
8              I'm going to end the same way I began.
9        Please, please, read those jury instructions
10        before you begin your deliberations.
11              And we ask of you only that your
12        deliberations and verdict in this case are
13        guided by legal principles in your instructions
14        and your own good conscience.
15              Thank you very much.


25              Counsel. TEPIKIAN:  May I proceed, Your Honor?
2              Counsel, Mr. McCoy, ladies and gentlemen
3        of the jury.  It's not quite lunch time, so
4        it's still good morning.
5              On behalf of Philip Morris, I want to
6        thank you for your time and attention.  You
7        have gone way above.
8              When we first did voir dire in this case,
9        we asked whether or not you would be able to
10        serve through three weeks.  That would have
11        been Friday of last week.
12              You're still here.  You're still coming
13        on time.  You've gone above and beyond.  And we
14        thank you for that.  I know everybody in the
15        courtroom thanks you for that.
16              During the first phase of the trial,
17        you've heard a lot of evidence about a lot of
18        issues, and there's no question about that.
19              But what Mr. Furr and I tried to do in
20        this phase of the case was to bring you the
21        evidence that we thought was important to you
22        to address the issues and address them directly
23        and succinctly, but to address the issues that
24        you need to consider as we address Phase II and
25        whether or not it is necessary to award any punitive damages in this case.
2              Now, what you learned in the second phase
3        of this trial is about Philip Morris, the
4        Philip Morris of 2015, the way it conducts
5        itself and the way it has changed the way it
6        conducts itself over the last 20, 30, 40, 50
7        years.
8              Dr. Lipowicz told you it's a different
9        company with different employees, and it
10        operates in a completely different environment
11        than it did in the past.
12              You learned that the people that work
13        with Philip Morris made a decision 15 years ago
14        to take the company in a different direction.
15              You've seen what Philip Morris says about
16        the health risks of smoking, and we're going to
17        discuss them again shortly.
18              You've seen what Philip Morris says about
19        the addictive nature of smoking, and you've
20        seen that that's been a consistent message for
21        the last 15 years.
22              Of course you heard about all the changes
23        that are in place, all the regulations and
24        restrictions that are in place with regard to
25        the way Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies conduct their business today.
2              Restrictions and regulations that affect
3        the company in so many significant ways.
4              Now, Mr. Furr touched on this, but I want
5        to bring this to your attention.
6              During your Phase I verdict, you did
7        apportion some fault to Mrs. McCoy.  You also,
8        of course, apportioned fault to R.J. Reynolds,
9        Lorillard and Philip Morris.  And from that, I
10        took that you thought that smoking was somehow
11        a shared responsibility --
12 Your Honor --
13              MR. TEPIKIAN:  -- at least at that
14        portion.
15 -- objection.
16        Comparative fault in Phase I has no role in
17        punitive damages.  I object, and move to
18        strike.
19              THE COURT:  Sustained.
20              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Please understand that the
21        comparative fault that you applied to
22        Mrs. McCoy doesn't apply to this portion of the
23        case.
24              Mr. McCoy will receive the entire amount
25        of the verdict that you rendered in Phase I, the 1.5 million.
2              But, ladies and gentlemen, we're in
3        Phase II.  So what we need to focus on now is
4        the past, the past 15 years, and how these
5        companies have changed since the Engle jury
6        rendered its findings, the present and the
7        future.
8              In this phase of the trial, you're going
9        to determine whether or not everything you've
10        heard, whether there's a need to award
11        Mr. McCoy any additional money in the form of
12        punitive damages.
13              That's because unlike in Phase I where
14        you compensated Mr. McCoy, the questions you
15        have to decide in this phase is how much
16        additional money, if any, and that's in your
17        instructions, you should award.
18              Not to compensate Mr. McCoy, but to
19        punish and deter Philip Morris for its past
20        conduct.  And to deter it and others in the
21        future.
22              That's the purpose of punitive damages,
23        and you'll see that in the instructions, to
24        punish and deter.
25              The instructions will tell you that you don't need to award any money in punitive
2        damages unless the plaintiff has met his
3        burden.
4              Unless the plaintiff satisfies and
5        persuades you that today, in 2015, it's
6        necessary to punish Philip Morris or
7        R.J. Reynolds for its past conduct.
8              Now, we brought you a witness.  You heard
9        from Dr. Lipowicz yesterday.  You saw and heard
10        him testify, and you also had an opportunity to
11        ask him some questions.
12              He told you about what Philip Morris is
13        like today, in 2015, and the changes that have
14        taken place since the original Engle jury
15        rendered its findings.
16              He told you about the Master Settlement
17        Agreement, and we're going to go through that.
18        He told you about Philip Morris's website and
19        the statements that it has made on its website.
20        He's told you that Philip Morris has decided
21        that the messages with regard to smoking and
22        health should be one unified voice, and that
23        voice should be from the public health
24        community.
25              He told you that Philip Morris no longer engages in any type of debate with regard to
2        smoking and health, and whether cigarettes are
3        addictive.
4              And remember what I said, it is still
5        Mr. McCoy's burden to show that an award of
6        punitive damages is appropriate.
7              And for the reasons that I'm going to
8        state and the reasons that we're going to go
9        through here, I suggest to you that an award of
10        punitive damages is not necessary in this case.
11              So, as Mr. Furr said, we really would
12        urge you to read the jury instructions again.
13              Unlike in the first phase where there
14        were many, many pages, these jury instructions
15        are only three pages.
16              The Court read to you them on Monday.
17        But, again, please take a moment to read
18        through them again, because I think that will
19        help you, as Mr. Furr said, funnel down to what
20        the issues are; but most importantly, what the
21        law is and how you are to apply the facts
22        you've heard to the law that the Court is
23        giving you.
24              The Court's instructed you that you can
25        only punish Philip Morris for the conduct that harmed Mrs.  McCoy.  The law does not permit
2        you to punish Philip Morris for harm suffered
3        by anyone other than Ms. McCoy.
4              Although you've heard about the class
5        action in this trial, this is still an
6        individual case.  This is still Mr. McCoy's
7        case.
8              So although you've heard several
9        references to the Engle class action, you've
10        heard Mr. Schlesinger repeatedly talk about the
11        thousands of death caused by smoking, you need
12        to keep in mind that just like the first phase,
13        this is still the case about Mrs. McCoy.
14              And why is that important?  It's
15        important because the laws of Florida, and the
16        laws of the United States say, again, you can't
17        punish Philip Morris or any of the other
18        tobacco companies for harms to other people.
19              And when you think about it, it makes
20        sense.  Because you don't know the facts and
21        the circumstances of any of those people.
22              You don't know whether or not they
23        started smoking, why they started smoking, when
24        they started smoking, or why they continued to
25        smoke. You don't know whether or not they ever
2        tried to quit.  You don't know whether or not
3        they were addicted.  You don't know what
4        information they had about the risks of
5        smoking.
6              Simply put, you don't know whether or not
7        the harm these people may have suffered was a
8        natural consequence of them using a risky, but
9        legal product, or whether or not Philip Morris
10        did something other than selling cigarettes
11        that caused the harm to them.
12              And that's why you can't consider harm to
13        other people when you consider whether or not
14        it's appropriate to punish Philip Morris in
15        this case.
16 Objection, Your Honor.
17              THE COURT:  Overruled.
18              MR. TEPIKIAN:  If other people believe
19        that they have been harmed, they can file a
20        lawsuit.
21              And you heard Dr. Lipowicz tell you that
22        there are approximately 3200 lawsuits currently
23        pending against Philip Morris within the state
24        of Florida.
25              Now, after you have gone back and you start your deliberations and you've identified
2        the specific harms that Philip Morris caused
3        Mrs. McCoy, the next critical determination for
4        you -- and it's part of the instructions -- is
5        to determine what has already been done to
6        address those issues.
7              The issues that brought us to Phase II is
8        because you found that there was a fraudulent
9        concealment and a conspiracy to fraudulently
10        conceal information.
11              So the question is, has anything been
12        done to address those issues?  And I think
13        based on Dr. Lipowicz's testimony and what we
14        will go through now, you will see that it has
15        been addressed and there is no reason to
16        continue punishment.
17              The jury instructions require you to
18        consider -- Mr. Furr touched on these, but I'm
19        going to read them as well, because they are
20        very important instructions.  They are on
21        page 2.
22              The jury instructions require you to
23        consider the extent to which the defendants'
24        conduct has changed from the conduct on which
25        you based your determination that punitive damages may be warranted.  And the extent to
2        which circumstances have changed.
3              You are entitled to conclude that
4        misconduct that occurred in the distant past
5        and involved actors who are no longer
6        associated with Philip Morris or the other
7        defendants need not be punished, or that it
8        should be punished less severely than recent
9        misconduct.  That's critical.
10              And you should -- and the instructions go
11        on.  You should only impose sanctions if you
12        conclude that the monetary liability beyond the
13        award of compensatory damages are necessary to
14        accomplish punishment and deterrence.
15              And you've already heard the instruction
16        with regard to mitigating evidence; that
17        mitigating evidence is evidence that may
18        demonstrate there's no need to impose punitive
19        damages or that a reduced amount is
20        appropriate.
21              Ladies and gentlemen, that's really the
22        whole heart of the issues that we are talking
23        about in Phase II.
24              You know that the findings from the Engle
25        jury were made over a decade and a half ago. This is a class action that began in the mid
2        '90s.  And we are litigating it now.  We are
3        litigating Mrs. McCoy's case now.
4              Back then, over a decade and a half ago,
5        that Engle jury made certain findings and found
6        that Philip Morris and the other tobacco
7        companies engaged in wrongful conduct in the
8        past.
9              They were looking at conduct that
10        occurred -- and you heard a lot about it -- but
11        in the '50s, in the '60s, in the '70s, and the
12        '80s.  But what the jury didn't hear anything
13        about, and what you heard about is what has
14        happened since then.
15              You've heard about what's going on with
16        the states, you've heard about the regulation
17        by the federal government.  You've heard about
18        the changes that Philip Morris and the other
19        companies have made in the last couple of
20        decades after those findings were made.
21              And why is it important?  The timing is
22        important.  Because if the wrongful conduct
23        that caused Mrs. McCoy's injuries has already
24        been addressed and can't be repeated, there's
25        no need for punishment.  There's no need for an additional award of money over and above what
2        you have already awarded to fully compensate
3        Mr. McCoy.
4              And, finally, as the Court has instructed
5        you, and Mr. Schlesinger touched on this as
6        well, as did Mr. Furr, you can't base your
7        decision on anger or anything like that.  It
8        has to be based upon the facts and the law, and
9        the law that the judge has given you.
10              So let's go over what's happened in the
11        last two decades.  All right?  It's 2015.  You
12        are required now to look at the company, look
13        at Philip Morris and make an assessment.  All
14        right?
15              Is it necessary to punish the company
16        today for things the company did in the past so
17        it won't happen again in the future?
18              All right?  That's what it really comes
19        down to.  And I think once we walk through all
20        this, because it is the timing that's critical,
21        the timing of when events occur, I think you're
22        going to find that an award of punitive damages
23        is not necessary.
24              Now, Mr. Schlesinger has suggested, I
25        believe, that it was Philip Morris back then, it's Philip Morris today.  And you should just
2        punish them.
3              He doesn't take into account, I believe,
4        all the things that have changed.
5              It may have the same name.  The company's
6        name is still Philip Morris.  But it's a
7        completely different company.  So let's talk
8        about today.  Let's talk about the Philip
9        Morris of today.
10              Let's talk about what Dr. Lipowicz told
11        you about.  We will talk about the MSA.  We are
12        going to talk about the website.  We're going
13        to talk about the FDA and the environment that
14        Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies
15        are operating in today, and whether or not that
16        environment has already addressed issues of
17        fraudulent concealment and conspiracy to
18        conceal.
19              So you heard about the MSA.  These were
20        lawsuits filed by the 50 states, by the major
21        tobacco manufacturers.
22              In 1998, Philip Morris and the other
23        companies reached a historic binding legal
24        agreement.  And they reached a settlement.
25              The settlement was called the Master Settlement Agreement.  The short term we use is
2        the MSA.  And the MSA fundamentally changed the
3        way the tobacco companies operate and the way
4        they market their product that is sold in this
5        country.
6              The MSA went into full effect in 1999,
7        and it provides for a number of things,
8        including --
9 May I approach, Judge?
10              THE COURT:  Yes.
11              (The following discussion was held at
12              sidebar:)
13              THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
14 May it please the
15        Court.  You gave them limited use of the MSA to
16        go into mitigation of damages, but please
17        reflect on this term of this MSA.  It's
18        completely nonadmissible.
19              It's not supposed to be used in any case
20        for any other reason other than to enforce the
21        settlement.  And this has been the argument
22        made over and over again.  And it's already in.
23        But they're going way too far with it.
24              And there should be some effect to this
25        conclusion of the MSA.  It's nonadmissible, nonusable.
2              It specifically says no evidence of it
3        shall be offered or received in evidence in any
4        action or any other action or proceeding except
5        to enforce the MSA settlement.
6              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor --
7 And they've really run
8        afoul of this and now they're running wild with
9        this.  They've taken it far beyond what
10        Your Honor was allowing them to use it in
11        litigation.
12              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Your Honor, I'm not doing
13        anything that has not been allowed in evidence.
14        What I'm doing is perfectly fine, and the
15        things that already came into evidence are
16        perfectly fine.  I would like to continue on
17        with my closing arguments.
18              THE COURT:  Counsel, I don't know what
19        the Third DCA you offered -- I don't know what
20        case you're talking about.  I don't know
21        anything about it.  But it seems to me he's --
22        Mr. Schlesinger is pointing out some language
23        in the Master Settlement Agreement.
24              MR. TEPIKIAN:  I --
25              THE COURT:  Excuse me, Counsel.  Let me finish.  All right?
2              It seems to me that it's been discussed
3        over and over again.  It's in evidence.  And so
4        whatever objection you made -- this is closing
5        argument.  He's talking about what's in
6        evidence.
7              So your objection noted, Mr. Schlesinger.
8        Respectfully, it's denied.
9              You know, maybe we can discuss in a
10        future case about it by pretrial motion.  But
11        it's in evidence.  He has the right to talk
12        about it.
13              MR. TEPIKIAN:  I apologize, Your Honor.
14              THE COURT:  No problem.
15              (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
16              following was held in open court:)
17              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Have a drink of water.
18              So let me pick up where I left off.  We
19        were talking about the MSA.  And what you heard
20        is the MSA provided for a number of things,
21        including the companies would make significant
22        payments, you heard about those, into the
23        billions of dollars, including to the State of
24        Florida, to address healthcare costs.
25              You've heard about how it dramatically -- it was designed to dramatically reduce youth
2        access to smoking and the public visibility of
3        cigarette advertising and imagery.
4              You heard about the MSA disbanded trade
5        industry organizations, including the CTR and
6        the Tobacco Institute and how the MSA
7        fundamentally changed what the tobacco
8        companies say about the health risks of smoking
9        and their addictive nature.
10              So I'm going to walk through that briefly
11        with you.  All right?
12              Philip Morris -- with regard to payments,
13        Philip Morris and the other companies are
14        required to make payments under the MSA to the
15        states.
16              You heard that Philip Morris, since the
17        MSA has gone into effect, has paid over
18        $70 billion to the 50 states, and that includes
19        $4 billion alone to the State of Florida, to
20        address healthcare costs to be used toward
21        youth access and prevention and other state
22        obligations.
23              In addition to the payments, Philip
24        Morris and the other companies agreed to a
25        number of different marketing restrictions. All right?
2              One of the things that the Attorneys
3        General were concerned about, and you heard
4        about this, was that they wanted to reduce
5        youth smoking.
6              And the MSA, it provided that Philip
7        Morris wouldn't take any action directly or
8        indirectly that would target youth in its
9        advertising or promotion of cigarettes.
10              And Philip Morris has strictly complied
11        with those requirements.  In the past 16 years,
12        you heard Dr. Lipowicz tell you this, that no
13        Attorneys General has ever taken any kind of
14        action against Philip Morris because it
15        believed it had violated those advertising
16        restrictions.
17              So consider that.  All right?  Consider
18        the things that have changed -- also changed
19        with regard to youth access in stores.
20              You heard in this case there was a time
21        when Mrs. McCoy was young that people under the
22        age of 18 had relatively easy access to
23        cigarettes.
24              You heard in the first phase about
25        opportunity to buy loosies, single cigarettes. Think about what it's like today.  If you
2        go into a store that sells cigarettes, you will
3        find that the products are all behind the
4        counter, where they're in a locked case.  And
5        that anybody trying to buy them is going to be
6        greeted by a clerk that has been trained -- and
7        Philip Morris is part of this -- has trained
8        and financially incentivized stores so that
9        they don't sell products to minors.  That's
10        part of the MSA.
11              In addition to limiting youth access to
12        people of legal age, the states were concerned
13        about advertising.  Right.  As a result, the
14        MSA provides significant restrictions and
15        fundamentally changed cigarette advertising in
16        this country.
17              During the first phase of this trial, you
18        saw a number of TV ads and radio commercials
19        for cigarettes.  Those were gone in 1971.
20              But the MSA took it much, much further.
21        The MSA severely restricts any type of outdoor
22        advertising.
23              For example, prior to 1998, it would have
24        been common to see cigarettes advertised on a
25        billboard. THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Yes, sir?
2 Objection.  Most of
3        this is not in evidence, Judge.
4              THE COURT:  Thank you.
5              Ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on
6        your own recollection of the evidence.
7 Can I have a continuing
8        objection on this MSA, Judge?
9              THE COURT:  Thank you.
10              Any objection to a continuing objection
11        regarding to MSA which has been discussed all
12        throughout the trial?
13              MR. TEPIKIAN:  No.
14              THE COURT:  Your objection is noted.
15        It's overruled.
16              MR. TEPIKIAN:  No objection to a
17        continuing objection, Your Honor.
18              You won't see it -- you saw it when you
19        have seen billboards.  You might have seen
20        cigarette advertising in a sports stadium or on
21        a bus or on a taxi.  Not anymore.
22              Philip Morris and the other tobacco
23        companies are not allowed to advertise in that
24        way.
25              The MSA also provides that there can be no more movie product placements.  Right?  I
2        think you're probably familiar with movie
3        product placements.  They are a very popular
4        way for companies to put their products into a
5        movie, right, and they pay for that.
6              The MSA provides that the tobacco
7        companies can no longer engage in any type of
8        movie product placement.  If you see someone
9        smoking in a movie today, it's because that's
10        what the producer wanted, not because Philip
11        Morris or any other company wanted to have
12        cigarettes there or paid to have that put in
13        the movie.
14 Objection.
15              MR. TEPIKIAN:  It simply doesn't happen
16        anymore.
17 No evidence.
18              THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you are
19        to rely on your own recollection of the
20        evidence.
21              Proceed, Counsel.
22              MR. TEPIKIAN:  To further reduce the
23        risks and the advertising, the MSA provided
24        that there could be no more branded
25        merchandise. So to the extent you might have seen back
2        before 1998 someone with a Marlboro hat, you
3        won't see that anymore.  If you see that
4        Marlboro hat, it's because it's either 16 years
5        old or somebody else made it.  It's not
6        allowed.
7              But what did Philip Morris do?  Did
8        Philip Morris just go with the MSA and just
9        those restrictions?  No, went a step further.
10        You heard Dr. Lipowicz tell you that.
11              In addition to that, Philip Morris
12        decided on its own to completely discontinue
13        advertising in magazines in 2005.  You will not
14        see a Philip Morris advertisement in any
15        magazine.
16              So let's turn to the websites.
17        Dr. Lipowicz talked to you about the Philip
18        Morris websites and the information that's
19        contained on the Philip Morris website.
20              And what that says, and what I had
21        Dr. Lipowicz walk you through, is the
22        information that's contained on there.
23              So it contains Philip Morris's statements
24        regarding its position on cigarettes and
25        whether cigarettes cause harm -- we're going to go through that -- on whether or not cigarettes
2        are addictive.
3              But it also provides a lot of information
4        with regard to ingredients and other
5        information, including links to take anybody
6        who is interested to the public health
7        community and the Surgeon General Report or
8        anywhere else that they want to go to get
9        information.
10              So what has Philip Morris been saying for
11        the last 15 years on its website about the
12        health effects of smoking?
13              Philip Morris has said that it agrees
14        with the overwhelming scientific and medical
15        consensus that cigarette smoking causes lung
16        cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and other
17        serious diseases in smokers; that smokers are
18        far more likely to develop serious diseases
19        like lung cancer than nonsmokers, and that
20        there's no such thing as a safe cigarette.
21              And Philip Morris has been saying the
22        following with regard to the addictive nature
23        of cigarettes:  That they agree with the
24        overwhelming medical and scientific consensus
25        that cigarette smoking is addictive.  It can be very difficult to quit smoking, but it
2        shouldn't deter smokers who want to quit from
3        trying to do so.
4              Those are very clear, simple statements
5        that Philip Morris has been making for 16
6        years.  And those are the only statements
7        Philip Morris has been making to the public for
8        16 years.
9              Philip Morris does not debate in the
10        public domain anything with regard to whether
11        cigarette smoking causes disease.  Philip
12        Morris believes that there should be a single
13        voice that the public hears with regard to
14        issues on this, and that is from the public
15        health community.
16              So let's talk a little bit about the FDA.
17        Mr. Furr touched on this, but I want to go
18        through it a little bit more and as it relates
19        to Philip Morris.
20              The MSA was an important event.  FDA
21        regulation was even more important.  As you
22        know, the FDA got the power to regulate tobacco
23        products and advertising in 2009.
24              You also heard Dr. Lipowicz tell you that
25        Philip Morris had been in support of FDA regulation since the year 2000.
2              Dr. Lipowicz told you the reasons why
3        Philip Morris supported FDA regulation.  He
4        told you Philip Morris wanted to help establish
5        a common set of high standards for all tobacco
6        manufacturers and importers doing business in
7        the U.S.
8              And, importantly, to provide a framework
9        for the evaluation of tobacco products that are
10        potentially less harmful than conventional
11        cigarettes, and to create clear principles for
12        the accurate and scientifically grounded
13        communication about tobacco products to adult
14        consumers.
15              The reality is, ladies and gentlemen,
16        there's a lot of people with interest in the
17        tobacco industry, right?  There are smokers,
18        nonsmokers, you have the public health
19        community, you have tobacco companies, tobacco
20        farmers, the states.  There's a lot of people
21        with an interest.
22              And as Mr. Furr touched, it is a
23        controversial product.
24              But these people often have disagreements
25        and have competing interests.  And what was needed and what the FDA brings is a process to
2        evaluate the science, weigh all of these
3        competing interests and issue final decisions
4        about how tobacco products are made, marketed
5        and sold.
6              And as you heard over the years, there's
7        been different ideas and theories about
8        nicotine levels, filters, ingredients and
9        advertising.
10              And even plaintiff's own experts in this
11        case disagreed on certain of those issues.
12              Now the FDA has the authority to make
13        decisions about all of that.  Now they have the
14        authority to make decisions about every
15        cigarette, how every cigarette is designed,
16        manufactured, and marketed in this country.
17              Now to carry out the mandate, the FDA
18        created a special center called the Center for
19        Tobacco Products.  All right?  And that center
20        is funded by user fees from the tobacco
21        companies.
22              And you heard Dr. Lipowicz tell you that
23        over the years, they have received half a
24        billion dollars a year in tobacco funding to do
25        this type of work. So what are some of the examples with
2        what the FDA is doing?  With respect to youth
3        market and youth smoking, the FDA contains many
4        of the same restrictions that are in the MSA,
5        but it also gives the federal government the
6        power to enforce those restrictions, the power
7        to level penalties and for anyone who violates
8        them.
9              The FDA also has the power to show up at
10        any kind of factory or facility.  And you heard
11        Dr. Lipowicz say that that has happened with
12        regard to Philip Morris.
13              You heard that they have the power to
14        seize products, shut down factories, impose
15        fines for noncompliance.  You heard that they
16        can -- now have the power to determine the
17        level of constituents in smoke, including
18        nicotine, and you heard that they can't ban
19        nicotine in cigarettes, but that they control
20        the amount of nicotine in cigarettes.
21              You also heard that they control and have
22        information about every ingredient that is in
23        every cigarette, and they have the formulas for
24        every cigarette.
25              They have the power to tell the companies you can't -- to change this or to change that.
2        And neither Philip Morris nor R.J. Reynolds nor
3        any other tobacco company can change the way
4        they manufacture any of those cigarettes
5        without approval from the FDA.
6              Bottom line is, the FDA now controls
7        exactly what goes into a cigarette, what comes
8        out of a cigarette, and what can be said about
9        a cigarette.
10              Part of the FDA and also part of the MSA
11        obligations were the disclosure of information.
12        In the MSA, companies were disclosing their
13        documents.  They're all available on a website.
14              The FDA takes it a step further, and they
15        provide more of those documents.  And they
16        provide documents to the public health
17        authority.
18              The bottom line is today that anybody who
19        wants to see an internal company document can
20        go on a website.  Philip Morris has its own
21        website, as does R.J. Reynolds, and they can
22        look at these documents.
23              THE COURT:  Two minutes, Counsel.
24              MR. TEPIKIAN:  So let me back up with --
25        given the time I have left here. We're operating in a different world now.
2        All right?  Mrs. McCoy began smoking in the
3        1940s.  The world was different then, and
4        Philip Morris was different then.
5              Consider the world Philip Morris operates
6        in today.  A 15-year-old today would have never
7        seen a Philip Morris advertisement on TV,
8        radio, or billboard, or in a stadium.
9              If they went into a store, their access
10        to cigarettes would be limited, because they
11        would be behind a counter.
12              They would have never heard a statement
13        from the Tobacco Institute or the CTR.  And for
14        their entire lives, documents from the tobacco
15        companies would have been available on the
16        internet.
17              And also for their entire lives, they
18        would have been paid -- Philip Morris would
19        have paid over $66 billion to the states, and
20        including an additional $4 billion to the State
21        of Florida.
22              And, finally, they would be living in a
23        time when smoking rates are at an all-time low,
24        particularly with regard to the state of
25        Florida and youth. Now, notwithstanding this changed
2        environment, Mr. Schlesinger has suggested that
3        you should award $15 million from Philip Morris
4        over and above what they've already awarded to
5        Mr. McCoy to fully compensate him.  Let's think
6        about that.
7 Objection, Your Honor.
8        It's punitive damages, not compensation.  It's
9        a misstatement of law.
10              THE COURT:  Objection noted.
11              They have the instruction, Counsel.
12              Proceed.
13              MR. TEPIKIAN:  Let's think about what
14        that number represents.
15              Again, in the state of Florida, if
16        someone's average annual income was $50,000, it
17        would take 300 years to make $15 million.  If
18        you added all that they're asking from the
19        other two companies, that's 900 years.
20              Ladies and gentlemen, the other thing
21        Mr. Schlesinger did was he said he wanted to
22        send a message.
23              This is your opportunity to send a
24        message.  I want you to think about this.
25        Think about what the message is of a $15 million punitive award against Philip
2        Morris or $45 million for all the companies.
3        What does that say?
4              It will say that even if you entered into
5        legally binding agreements that fundamentally
6        change the way you do your business, and even
7        if you subject yourself to significant
8        government oversight, and even if you agree to
9        pay substantial sums of money to address
10        conduct you did in the past, you'll still be
11        hit with a significant punitive damage award.
12        What's the incentive?
13              If you want to encourage companies to
14        change their conduct and you want to encourage
15        companies that have changed their conduct over
16        the last two decades, sending a -- giving a
17        punitive damage award in this case is sending
18        them the wrong message.  It's telling them that
19        reform doesn't matter.
20              Ladies and gentlemen, the MSA, the FDA
21        and reform matters.  You must consider this
22        mitigating evidence about what's happened in
23        the last 15 years when you go back in your
24        deliberations.
25              Given these developments, given what's happened in the last 15 years, I respectfully
2        suggest to you that awarding Mr. McCoy
3        additional money in the form of punitive
4        damages is not necessary.
5              But if you decide that an award of
6        punitive damages is appropriate, I think an
7        award in the range of $150,000 to $200,000 is a
8        reasonable amount under the laws that govern
9        punitive damages, given the compensatory award
10        that you considered in this case.
11              I'm going to sit down now.  My time is
12        almost up, if it's not already up.
13              But I ask for just a moment, Your Honor.
14              This is the last time I'm going to have a
15        chance to talk with you.  Again, I want to
16        thank you for your time.
17              It really has been an honor and a
18        privilege to present the case to you.
19              I don't think there's any question about
20        the people -- about what the people in the
21        courtroom think about your service, your
22        attention, the fact that you've been here right
23        on time every day ready to start, even though
24        we've delayed you almost every day because
25        we've had to take up issues with the Court. But I'm going to sit down now.  I want to
2        leave you with this thought.
3              Mr. Schlesinger is going to get up.  He's
4        got some time left.  And as you listen to the
5        things Mr. Schlesinger says, I want you to
6        think about what purpose is served by
7        punishment?
8              Given everything you know today about the
9        way Philip Morris operates, what purpose is
10        served by punishing Philip Morris with a
11        punitive damage award?
12              They have changed their conduct.  You've
13        heard about it.  You have heard about the
14        changes that have occurred in the last 15
15        years.  You've heard about the disclosure.
16        There is no more concealment of information.
17        There is no conspiracy.  There is none of that.
18        There are no trade organizations.  There's no
19        TI, no CTR.
20              So, again, think of that and think of the
21        environment that they operate in today.
22              Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much
23        for your time, and I appreciate it.
