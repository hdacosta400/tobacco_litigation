·9· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
10· You know my name is Bill Geraghty, and I representative
11· Philip Morris in this case.· And I want to start on behalf of
12· my client to thank you for your time and service in this
13· case.· It's very clear that you've been paying attention,
14· you've been extremely patient during all the questioning and
15· examination, and we all truly appreciate it.· We know the
16· jury service is often inconvenient, but without folks like
17· you who are willing to take some time out from your lives,
18· our system of justice simply wouldn't work.· So let me just
19· say again, thank you very much.
20· · · · · · We are getting close to the end of the road, no
21· doubt, but your work isn't quite done.· Once we finish these
22· closing arguments, Judge Covington will read you a set
23· instructions, and that is the law that you will follow in
24· this case.
25· · · · · · And after that is done, you'll get what's called a
·1· verdict form, and you saw snapshots of it up on the screen.
·2· And that verdict form asks the questions that you all need to
·3· answer to resolve this case.· But before you deliberate, this
·4· is my opportunity to summarize for you the evidence that
·5· we've seen and heard over the last week or so.
·6· · · · · · I want to remind you what I told you in my opening
·7· statement.· I told you that Mr. Heimann would spend a lot of
·8· his time talking about documents and statements made by
·9· Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds 25, 30, 40, 50, and even as
10· far back at 60 years ago.
11· · · · · · And I told you over a week ago that I would not try
12· to defend all of those statements.· Many of those documents
13· say things and express ideas that today neither you nor I
14· would say or think, and I told you that over a week ago.
15· · · · · · But I also told you that if that were all this case
16· were about, if all the plaintiff had to prove was that an
17· executive for Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds had said
18· something appropriate, we wouldn't have spent the last week
19· and a half together.
20· · · · · · But we have, and that's because this case isn't
21· about all cigarette smokers.· It's about Mrs. Mercedia
22· Wilbert.· It's about her life and her decisions.· And almost
23· every one of the questions you'll see on that verdict form
24· asks you specifically about Mrs. Wilbert, not all cigarette
25· smokers and not the general public.
·1· · · · · · Now, as part of the instructions that Judge
·2· Covington will give you, you're going to hear about findings
·3· made by a prior jury, and you heard Mr. Heimann mention
·4· those.· That jury, when it made those findings, knew nothing
·5· about Mercedia Wilbert.· Those findings don't tell you how to
·6· answer the questions in this case.· You decide through your
·7· verdict in this case whether those findings have any
·8· applicably to Mercedia Wilbert, her life, and her decisions.
·9· · · · · · Now, Mr. Heimann also said one thing that I would
10· like to address.· He talked about the fact that we didn't
11· bring any witnesses.· And you know what?· He's right.· We
12· didn't.· But this case is not about who brought more
13· witnesses.· It's about what evidence you find to be most
14· convincing, the most persuasive, the most compelling.· And
15· you heard everything you need to know from us, from me and
16· Mr. Baringer, through the questions we asked the plaintiff's
17· witnesses.
18· · · · · · That's why some of our cross examinations tended to
19· last longer than some of the questions that the plaintiff's
20· lawyers asked.· We know you are sacrificing your time to be
21· here.· We had, in fact, hoped you would be done on Friday,
22· but it didn't work out that way.· We didn't think you needed
23· to spend any more time here before you decided this case.
24· · · · · · And one last thing I'd like to address before I talk
25· to you about the evidence, many of you may feel sympathy for
·1· Ms. McCray and her family for the loss of their mother
·2· 18 years ago.· It's only natural.· We are all human.· That's
·3· a natural feeling.· But Judge Covington will instruct you
·4· that those natural feelings of sympathy must be set aside and
·5· that you must base your decision in this case solely from the
·6· evidence you heard from that witness stand and from the
·7· instructions that the court will give you at the end of the
·8· case.
·9· · · · · · And I know you all took an oath that you would do
10· that at the beginning, and I know you took that oath
11· seriously, so I have no doubt that you will be able to do
12· that.
13· · · · · · I told you at the beginning of this case that we
14· could sum it up in two words:· control and responsibility.
15· And I asked you to ask yourselves a series of questions as
16· you listened to the evidence in this case.
17· · · · · · Who was in control of Mrs. Wilbert's lifestyle
18· choices?· Who controlled her decisions to start smoking and
19· to continue smoking?· Who was in control of her efforts to
20· quit smoking?· Who controlled whether she was motivated and
21· determined to quit?· Was Mrs. Wilbert addicted?· And if she
22· was, was she somebody whose addiction was so strong, so
23· powerful, that it overcame a committed effort on her part to
24· quit?· And, finally, did she rely on anything that Philip
25· Morris or R.J. Reynolds said or failed to say about the
·1· health risks of smoking?· And I told you that when you could
·2· answer those questions, you would know who was in control and
·3· ultimately who is responsible in this case.
·4· · · · · · Now, when I talked to you during my opening
·5· statement, I spent a lot of my time walking you through the
·6· events in Ms. Mercedia Wilbert's life.· Because even though
·7· Mr. Heimann didn't spend much time talking about it during
·8· his presentation, this case, as you all now know, is about
·9· her.· And I'd like to walk you through the evidence we've
10· heard, because everything I told you in my opening statement,
11· everything I told you has turned out to be true, after having
12· heard the evidence in this case.
13· · · · · · I told you that there would be primarily two sources
14· of evidence.· First, information created long before this
15· lawsuit was ever filed, things that Mrs. Wilbert herself told
16· her doctors and told the insurance company.· And then I also
17· told you that the second source would be information created
18· after the lawsuit was filed, the testimony you heard from
19· people on the witness stand, most of whom have a direct
20· financial interest in the outcome of this case.
21· · · · · · Now, some of these facts came directly from
22· Mrs. Wilbert herself through the medical records and the
23· insurance application that you've seen, and some of it came
24· from the plaintiff's own witnesses.
25· · · · · · Now, a number of those witnesses didn't tell you
·1· everything when they were being asked questions by their own
·2· attorneys.· As you saw, we had to remind them of things they
·3· had said under oath in their depositions before this trial
·4· started or things that they had said in written answers --
·5· written answers that they had sworn to under penalty of
·6· perjury.· But eventually each one of them acknowledged that
·7· what we had told you about Mrs. Wilbert was right.
·8· · · · · · So let's start walking through the evidence right
·9· now, ladies and gentlemen.· And to help do that, this is a
10· pretty basic thing here, but I've just jotted down a series
11· of dates, significant dates in the life of Mrs. Wilbert, and
12· we're going to walk through those dates, and I'm going to
13· remind you of the evidence that we've heard over the last
14· week or so.
15· · · · · · You know that Mrs. Wilbert was born right here in
16· Jacksonville in 1935.· She was the youngest of three
17· children, the baby in her family.· You know that her parents
18· were very strict and very religious.· You heard all of that
19· from her son Michael DuBose.· He told you that her parents
20· taught her and him that cigarette smoking was strictly
21· forbidden, strictly forbidden.
22· · · · · · Now, during this trial you heard that before
23· Mrs. Wilbert ever picked up a cigarette, before she ever
24· picked up her first cigarette, people in this country had
25· been referring to cigarettes as coffin nails, to cigarette
·1· smokers as nicotine fiends.· You heard that well over
·2· 100 years ago people in this country understood that
·3· cigarette smoking can be difficult to quit and that the
·4· reason for that specifically is nicotine, nicotine.
·5· · · · · · In fact, you heard that the Florida Department of
·6· Health declared that cigarette smoking was the worst form of
·7· tobacco addiction, the worst form of tobacco addiction.· That
·8· was right here in Jacksonville in 1906, 1906, almost 30 years
·9· before she was born.· This was no secret, ladies and
10· gentlemen.
11· · · · · · Later on you heard that in the 1930s and 1940s
12· popular magazines like Reader's Digest published stories
13· saying that cigarette smoking is dangerous, cigarette smoking
14· can cause cancer, it can be hard to quit smoking cigarettes.
15· You heard all of that evidence, and we moved several pieces
16· of that evidence, several of those magazine articles, into
17· evidence.
18· · · · · · If we move into the early 1950s, you heard that the
19· very first scientific studies were published that associated
20· cigarette smoking with lung cancer, and we talked to you
21· about several of those studies.
22· · · · · · If we could show the first one, please.
23· · · · · · You heard about this study published in Life
24· Magazine in 1953, the story "Smoke Gets in the News."· You
25· heard about how these scientists painted tar on the back of
·1· mice and those mice developed tumors.· And this was big news,
·2· front-page news on newspapers and magazines.
·3· · · · · · And you also heard that one year after the
·4· publication of this study, in 1954, 90 percent of the
·5· American public said they had heard that cigarette smoking
·6· causes lung cancer, 1954.
·7· · · · · · Now, was the DuBose family aware of this
·8· information?· Well, you heard already.· You know they were
·9· intelligent, they were well-read, they were well-educated.
10· That's how Mercedia Wilbert was raised.· Her father ran a
11· successful business.· We know that Mr. and Mrs. DuBose taught
12· all three of their children in no uncertain terms, do not
13· smoke.· And we know that the two oldest children in the
14· family never smoked cigarettes.
15· · · · · · But Mercedia Wilbert doesn't follow her parents'
16· teachings, as you heard.· In about 1952 or 1953, when she's
17· 17 years old, she tries her first cigarette.
18· · · · · · Now, you heard Mr. Heimann talk a lot about
19· cigarette advertising, but the evidence you heard shows that
20· Mrs. Wilbert didn't start smoking cigarettes because of
21· cigarette advertising.· You heard the story.· She was with
22· her girlfriends, they were at a football game, they offered
23· her a cigarette, and she tried it.· That's what you heard.
24· · · · · · And even Dr. Cummings -- even Dr. Cummings told you
25· that the biggest influence on whether someone will begin
·1· smoking is whether his or her friends are smoking cigarettes.
·2· That's exactly what you heard in this case.
·3· · · · · · Mrs. Wilbert doesn't become a regular cigarette
·4· smoker until several years later, though, when she is an
·5· adult.· We know that she graduates from high school in 1954.
·6· The entire time she is living at home with her parents she
·7· hides her cigarette smoking from them because she knows --
·8· she knows full well that they would punish her if they found
·9· out she was smoking cigarettes.· You heard that from
10· Mr. Thomas Walker.
11· · · · · · Even in later years, when she's in her 30s and 40s,
12· she never smokes in front of her parents because she knows
13· how much that would upset them.
14· · · · · · 1954 she graduates from high school.· She moves to
15· Los Angeles and attends college at UCLA.· She lives with her
16· Aunt Esther.· Her Aunt Esther is her mother's sister.· Like
17· Mrs. Wilbert's mother, you heard that Aunt Esther is strict
18· and does not approve of Mercedia Wilbert smoking cigarettes.
19· If she wouldn't smoke in front of her mother, do you think
20· she would really smoke in front of her aunt?
21· · · · · · In 1956, while she's still living in Los Angeles,
22· her first son, Michael DuBose, is born.· Later she marries
23· her first husband, Thomas Walker.
24· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Objection.
25· · · · · · THE COURT:· Overruled.
·1· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· In about 1956, they move back to
·2· Jacksonville, and it is at this time that she first begins
·3· smoking cigarettes on a daily basis.· Mrs. Wilbert is finally
·4· living on her own.· She's in her 20s.· She decides she's
·5· going to live life her way, not the way her parents want her
·6· to live.
·7· · · · · · And did that have anything to do with cigarette
·8· advertising?· Remember again, her first husband, Mr. Thomas
·9· Walker, he testified last Wednesday.· I asked him
10· specifically about advertising.· Do you remember any
11· advertising?· Did you and Mrs. Wilbert discuss any
12· advertising?· He was adamant about it.· He said advertising?
13· No way.· Not where I grew up.· Not in my neighborhood.
14· That's what he told you.
15· · · · · · In 1964, you heard that Mrs. Wilbert and her first
16· husband, Thomas Walker, get divorced.· What else happens in
17· 1964?· You heard that the Surgeon General of the United
18· States issues a landmark report in January of 1964.· That
19· report includes cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and
20· chronic bronchitis.· It is front-page news on every paper in
21· the country, including right here in Jacksonville.
22· · · · · · If we could show that, please.
23· · · · · · And, Your Honor, I forgot to mention the first one I
24· showed was Plaintiff's Exhibit 64.
25· · · · · · THE COURT:· Thank you.· I wanted to remind you of
·1· that.
·2· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· And this one is Defendants'
·3· Exhibit 46.· This is the front page of the Jacksonville,
·4· Florida, Times-Union, January 12th, 1964:· Cigarette smoking
·5· held grave hazard to health in U.S.
·6· · · · · · You also heard that this report was the lead news
·7· story on every single television station in January of 1964.
·8· So every American, including Mercedia Wilbert, was told
·9· cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and death.
10· · · · · · We move forward, two years later, you heard Congress
11· passes a law that requires the placement of a warning on
12· every single pack of cigarettes beginning in 1966.· That
13· warning says:· "Caution:· Cigarette smoking may be hazardous
14· to your health."
15· · · · · · Now -- so by 1966, every pack of cigarettes that
16· Mercedia Wilbert buys carries a warning that says smoking is
17· dangerous.· Over time the language of those warnings changes,
18· but from this point forward every cigarette pack in the
19· United States has a warning on it.
20· · · · · · Now, I told you there would be discrepancies in the
21· evidence on several important issues.· I told you that more
22· than a week ago.· And I bring this up here because one of the
23· significant discrepancies involves the brands of cigarettes
24· that Mrs. Wilbert smoked.· You've heard a lot of testimony
25· about a brand called Kent and Kent Golden Lights.
·1· · · · · · You now know that that's a brand manufactured by a
·2· company called the Lorillard Tobacco Company.· Mrs. McCray is
·3· not suing that company in this case.· In her first verified
·4· worksheet, Ms. McCray said that her mother smoked Kent and
·5· Kent Golden Lights from 1955 to 1967.· She said her mother
·6· did not start smoking a brand made by either of the companies
·7· in this case, Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds, until at least
·8· 1967 or 1968.
·9· · · · · · If we could show the verified worksheet.· Your
10· Honor, this is part of Defense Exhibit 98.
11· · · · · · THE COURT:· That's fine.· Thank you.
12· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· This is that verified worksheet.· The
13· date was February 28th, 2011, and Ms. McCray swore under oath
14· these were the brands of cigarettes her mother smoked and the
15· years she smoked them.· And you can see Kent from 1955 to '63
16· and Kent Golden Lights from '63 to '67.
17· · · · · · Lark I've highlighted because that's made by another
18· company who Ms. McCray is not suing in this case, a company
19· called Liggett & Meyers.
20· · · · · · You don't see the first mention of a brand made by
21· either of the companies in this case until 1977.
22· · · · · · Now, Mr. Heimann said, well, she wasn't -- her mom
23· had been smoking for several years by the time she was born.
24· Well, in 1977 Ms. McCray is 19 years old, 20 years old.
25· · · · · · Now, we then showed her her interrogatories, and the
·1· interrogatories show that after this she even expands the
·2· length of time her mother was smoking Kent cigarettes.
·3· · · · · · If we could show that, Your Honor.
·4· · · · · · These are the sworn answers to interrogatories she
·5· signed on May 22, 2011.
·6· · · · · · And, Your Honor, we did not move this document into
·7· evidence, but I walked Ms. McCray through each of these and
·8· she confirmed --
·9· · · · · · THE COURT:· I think you had it as an exhibit.
10· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· I identified it, that's correct.
11· · · · · · And this is what Ms. McCray said three months later.
12· Three months later she said:· To the best of my knowledge,
13· Mrs. Wilbert smoked the following brands.· She says Larks in
14· the '50s, Kent 1950s to 1960s, and she adds 1980s to 1990s.
15· And then she puts Kent Golden Lights, 1960s.
16· · · · · · Now, you now know that Ms. McCray did not prepare
17· these documents lightly.· During my cross examination,
18· Ms. McCray admitted she talked to both of her brothers, her
19· sister, and her father before she signed these answers under
20· oath.· She signed the verified worksheet under penalty of
21· perjury, swearing that the information she provided was true
22· and accurate.
23· · · · · · You've now heard that Ms. McCray has changed these
24· answers a number of times.· You heard Ms. McCray changed it
25· to add brands made by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds in the
·1· 1950s and 1960s.· You heard that after meeting with her
·2· lawyers -- and you know that she has several different sets
·3· of lawyers -- she changed it in her deposition to say her
·4· mother hardly smoked Kent at all.· She would only smoke it
·5· when she borrowed a Kent from a neighbor or a friend.
·6· · · · · · And, finally, right here in this courtroom after I
·7· confronted her with all of the discrepancies, she told you,
·8· "You know what?· I was confused.· I really didn't know what
·9· this question was asking me to tell you."
10· · · · · · And Ms. McCray wasn't the only one who changed her
11· testimony on this issue.· Several witnesses conveniently
12· forget that Mrs. Wilbert had smoked Kent cigarettes.
13· Mr. Baringer and I had to remind them during our cross
14· examination that Mrs. Wilbert smoked Kent.· But in their
15· depositions, they told you they remembered Kent the most.
16· Let me show you the testimony.
17· · · · · · Michael DuBose, at the top, he's the oldest son,
18· oldest son of Mrs. Wilbert, he said he remembers Kent
19· vividly.· Vividly, that was his word.· He told you he bought
20· Kent in 1965, 1966, and 1967.· During the three years that he
21· was buying cigarettes for his mother, he said he saw Kent the
22· most, particularly in later years.
23· · · · · · His younger sister, Beverly Ellis, she testified
24· that she bought cartons of Kent in the 1960s.
25· · · · · · And then Mr. Wilbert, her third husband, he told you
·1· Kent was her primary brand during the years that they were
·2· married.
·3· · · · · · That's the testimony you've heard in this case, but
·4· that is not what you heard in response to the questions that
·5· Ms. Barnett asked them.· And so you have to ask yourself why
·6· would they change their testimony?· Why would Ms. McCray
·7· change these answers?· Why would they run from the fact that
·8· she smoked Kent and try to minimize the fact that she smoked
·9· a brand made by a company who she's not suing in this case?
10· · · · · · Well, there are at least two reasons.· First, you've
11· heard from Mr. Heimann Ms. McCray is claiming in this case
12· that Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds concealed information
13· about the health risks of smoking from Mrs. Wilbert.
14· · · · · · But according to Ms. McCray's answers here, her
15· mother did not smoke a brand of cigarettes made by either of
16· the two companies who are defendants in this case until at
17· least 1967 or 1968, more than a year after warnings are first
18· put on cigarette packages.· So every pack of cigarettes
19· Mrs. Wilbert bought manufactured by Philip Morris and
20· R.J. Reynolds had a government-mandated warning on it.· How
21· can you conceal information from somebody when the warning is
22· printed right on the pack?
23· · · · · · Second -- you heard Mr. Heimann allude to this --
24· Ms. McCray and her lawyers have to prove that some conduct on
25· the part of Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds was the, quote,
·1· legal cause of Mrs. Wilbert's injury and death.· And based on
·2· what you've heard, the family members have all told you that
·3· she smoked Kent as her primary brand for most of her life.
·4· · · · · · Plaintiff has to prove that she smoked enough
·5· cigarettes made by the two companies who are defendants in
·6· this case for their cigarettes to be the legal cause of her
·7· disease and death.· And you've been here for the last week or
·8· so, ladies and gentlemen.· You know they simply haven't
·9· proved that to you.· They haven't proved that to you.
10· · · · · · I had left off the time line at about 1966 or 1967,
11· after warnings go on packs of cigarettes.· The evidence you
12· heard is those were not the only warnings that Mrs. Wilbert
13· received.
14· · · · · · In the late 1960s, Mrs. Wilbert begins to ask her
15· children to pick things up from the store for her, including
16· cigarettes.· And you heard Michael DuBose tell you:· And we
17· would start telling our mom, you know, Mom, you shouldn't
18· smoke.· Mom, smoking is bad for you.
19· · · · · · You heard from her youngest son, Thomas Wayne
20· Walker, when he was in seventh or eighth grade in the early
21· 1970s he was taught that smoking was dangerous in his health
22· class.· They showed him the healthy pink lung of a lifelong
23· nonsmoker, and then they showed him the dark lungs of a
24· long-term smoker.
25· · · · · · Her children knew that, and that's what they told
·1· her.· That's what they told her.· And Mr. DuBose was very
·2· clear.· He told you flat out:· We told our mother smoking was
·3· bad for her health because we were concerned about her
·4· health, and she knew it was because we were concerned about
·5· her health.
·6· · · · · · And over the years her children and her friends
·7· continued to tell her:· You shouldn't smoke.· You should cut
·8· down.· You should quit.
·9· · · · · · And what does Mrs. Wilbert say in response?· You
10· already know the answer.· Mind your own business.· This is
11· grown folks' business.· I'm going to do what I want to do.
12· That was her response.
13· · · · · · Now, the plaintiff would have you believe that these
14· warnings and all these health messages were somehow drowned
15· out by cigarette advertisements and statements made these
16· companies.· Mr. Heimann showed you an FTC report that said,
17· well, the warnings aren't as effective as they could be.
18· · · · · · Ladies and gentlemen, use your common sense.· The
19· judge will tell you use your common sense.· There may be some
20· smokers who didn't pay attention to the warnings, but that's
21· not Mrs. Wilbert.· There are warnings on the packs.· She
22· hears it from her friends and family.· She hears it from her
23· children.· In fact, you heard Ms. McCray tell you she told
24· her mother that cigarettes were cancer sticks, cancer sticks.
25· She told her mom:· If you keep smoking, you could die.
·1· · · · · · And what did her mother say in response?· No, it's
·2· not going to happen to me.· Not going to happen to me.· That
·3· was her attitude about cigarette smoking.· And ladies and
·4· gentlemen, that's okay.· People can make their own decisions
·5· in this country, even the decisions that all of us here in
·6· this courtroom might say with the benefit of hindsight were
·7· not in her best interests.· But at the end of the day, is
·8· anyone else responsible for making those decisions?
·9· · · · · · And what is going on in America at the same time
10· we're talking about?· You heard the testimony.· Between 1964
11· and 1979, that 15-year period, Dr. Cummings told you
12· 30 million Americans quit smoking.· That's 2 million every
13· single year.· This is during the same period that Mr. Heimann
14· told you that Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are creating a
15· so-called controversy about whether smoking causes disease.
16· · · · · · Well, these 30 million people heard the same
17· information as Mrs. Wilbert.· Many of them are addicted.· It
18· may take them more than one try to succeed, but they quit and
19· they quit for good.
20· · · · · · Plus, Mrs. Wilbert decides to continue smoking.· And
21· her decision is important because of what you heard from
22· Dr. Burns.· Dr. Burns testified just on Friday.· Dr. Burns
23· told you that if she had quit by 1979 or 1980, she would not
24· have developed lung cancer and she would not have passed away
25· in 1994.· You heard that from their own medical expert.
·1· That's what he told you.
·2· · · · · · And remember what Dr. Burns said.· He told a group
·3· during a speech just one year later, in 1981 -- Dr. Burns,
·4· the plaintiff's own expert said in 1981:· I gave a speech,
·5· and I told that group 95 percent of people in this country
·6· are, quote, thoroughly aware of the dangers of cigarette
·7· smoking.· He said 90 percent of smokers believe that smoking
·8· is going to harm their own health.· He said more people in
·9· this country know that cigarette smoking causes disease than
10· who knew the name of the president of the United States.· In
11· 1981, that was Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan.
12· · · · · · So is Mrs. Wilbert smoking because she has lost
13· control?· No, and for several reasons.· You know that she
14· enjoyed smoking cigarettes.· Her son Mr. DuBose told you
15· smoking relaxed her; it stimulated her; it helped her relieve
16· stress.
17· · · · · · She enjoyed socializing with friends, entertaining,
18· playing cards.· You heard that from both Michael DuBose and
19· from Anita McCray herself.· And when she did these things,
20· she enjoyed smoking cigarettes and drinking beer.
21· · · · · · She wasn't embarrassed about her cigarette smoking.
22· You heard Ms. McCray say that every single one of her friends
23· was a cigarette smoker.· She did these things for fun and
24· enjoyment, and she surrounded herself with people who enjoyed
25· the same things.
·1· · · · · · And, second, you heard that she controlled her
·2· smoking when she needed to.· You know that she never smoked
·3· in front of her parents, and you heard that her parents spent
·4· a lot of time both with Mrs. Wilbert and with their
·5· grandkids.
·6· · · · · · You know that she worked in a factory, first at
·7· Frito-Lay and then later at Anheuser-Busch, and you know that
·8· she did not smoke on the production line.· You have to ask
·9· yourself after the evidence you've heard whether at this
10· point in time was Mrs. Wilbert even interested in quitting
11· smoking.
12· · · · · · Remember Thomas Walker, her first husband, he told
13· you that in the entire period of time they were married
14· Mrs. Wilbert never tried to quit smoking; she wasn't
15· interested in quitting smoking.
16· · · · · · And then there's Herbert Wilbert, her third husband.
17· He's the gentleman -- he borrowed my glasses so he could read
18· his deposition.· We reminded him what he said about his
19· conversations with Mrs. Wilbert in his deposition, and he
20· told Mrs. Wilbert to quit smoking.· And she would tell him in
21· response:· Mind your own business.· I'm going to do what I
22· want to do.
23· · · · · · And eventually, when Ms. McCray testified, she told
24· you exactly the same thing.
25· · · · · · If we could show her testimony, please.
·1· · · · · · This is Ms. McCray's testimony from Thursday:· When
·2· people -- this is the question I asked her:· When people, her
·3· friends in particular --
·4· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Your Honor, I object.
·5· · · · · · THE COURT:· Overruled.· It's closing argument.
·6· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· The question I asked her was:· When
·7· people, her friends in particular, told her she was smoking
·8· too much or she should quit or cut down -- you heard the
·9· testimony of Mr. Wilbert and other people -- she told people
10· to mind your own business, didn't she?
11· · · · · · Ms. McCray said:· She sure did.
12· · · · · · I then asked her:· She told people I'm going to live
13· life the way I'm going to live, didn't she?
14· · · · · · ANSWER:· She sure did.
15· · · · · · That's the testimony you heard in this courtroom
16· from the plaintiff herself.
17· · · · · · Take that down, please.
18· · · · · · You heard that Mrs. Wilbert apparently said she was
19· going to quit a lot.· But the persuasive evidence, ladies and
20· gentlemen, the compelling evidence, is not what she said, but
21· what she actually did.
22· · · · · · And remember during my cross examination Ms. McCray
23· finally admitted that while her mother said she would quit
24· lots of times, she never quit for one day before 1993, not
25· one day.· Think about that as you consider the evidence
·1· you've heard.
·2· · · · · · Now, when I say that, I want you to understand I'm
·3· not meaning to be critical of Mrs. Wilbert for how she lived
·4· her life.· It was her right to choose to live her life that
·5· way, but at the end of the day, again, she is responsible for
·6· making those decisions.
·7· · · · · · And the facts are what the facts are.· We don't get
·8· to change them.· And what you saw in this courtroom was an
·9· effort by her children to reinvent who their mother was and
10· how she had lived her life.
11· · · · · · Now, that brings us to 1985.
12· · · · · · And if could put this up this, please.
13· · · · · · This is the warning that the jury heard about, Your
14· Honor.
15· · · · · · In 1985, the warnings on cigarette packs changed,
16· and there's a series of four rotating warnings, and you heard
17· about this in the evidence.· One of those warnings says:
18· "Surgeon General's warning:· Smoking causes lung cancer,
19· heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy."
20· · · · · · This is in 1985, right around the time Mrs. Wilbert
21· starts experiencing a chronic cough and shortness of breath.
22· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· I object again, Your Honor.
23· · · · · · THE COURT:· Overruled.
24· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· Why am I telling you this and why is
25· this important?· It's important because one of the questions
·1· you'll be asked to decide on the verdict form is a statute of
·2· limitations question.· The question will read:· Please state
·3· whether Mrs. Wilbert knew or should have known in the
·4· exercise of reasonable care before May 5, 1990, that she had
·5· been injured and that there was a reasonable possibility that
·6· her injury was caused by cigarette smoking.
·7· · · · · · And if you answer yes to that question -- and I
·8· think the facts are very clear the answer to that question is
·9· yes -- this case is over, and we all go home.
10· · · · · · So what is the evidence that you've heard that bears
11· on this particular question?· You heard that by 1986
12· Mrs. Wilbert was suffering from shortness of breath and a
13· smoker's cough.
14· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Objection again, Your Honor.
15· · · · · · THE COURT:· Sir, I've asked that -- I'm overruling
16· all of your objections.· Please take your seat.
17· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· I'm protecting my record.
18· · · · · · THE COURT:· Sir, sir, it's closing argument.
19· · · · · · Go ahead, Mr. Geraghty.
20· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· You heard that from Mr. Tunsil.· He
21· was the gentleman that worked at Anheuser-Busch with Mercedia
22· Wilbert.
23· · · · · · If we could put his first testimony up, please.
24· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· I again object to this, Your Honor, to
25· actually putting up the transcript of the testimony in
·1· closing argument as improper.
·2· · · · · · THE COURT:· Overruled.
·3· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· Mr. Tunsil is one of the only
·4· witnesses in this case who does not have a direct financial
·5· interest in the outcome.· And here is what Mr. Tunsil said.
·6· Mr. Baringer was asking him these questions.
·7· · · · · · QUESTION:· I want to ask you some questions about
·8· her health when you met her.· This is in 1986.· She had a
·9· smoker's cough back then, didn't she?
10· · · · · · ANSWER:· Yes.
11· · · · · · QUESTION:· And she would sort of pound on her chest
12· to get her breath back because she was short of breath at the
13· time.
14· · · · · · His answer:· I remember her pounding her chest.
15· · · · · · That's the testimony of Mr. Tunsil.· And coughing
16· and shortness of breath are the signs and symptoms of a lung
17· condition like COPD or emphysema.
18· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Objection.
19· · · · · · THE COURT:· Overruled.
20· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· A few years later, in 1989, you heard
21· Mrs. Wilbert is admitted to the emergency room at
22· St. Vincent's Medical Center.· Now, unfortunately, we don't
23· have the actual medical records themselves.· All we have is
24· that one billing record that I showed you during my
25· examination of Ms. McCray.· Those records have all been
·1· destroyed by the hospital because it was more than 22 years
·2· ago, so we don't know exactly what was wrong with
·3· Mrs. Wilbert in 1989.· But that's why we have a statute of
·4· limitations, because evidence, in this case medical records,
·5· are lost or destroyed over time.· But we do know certain
·6· things from the record we have.
·7· · · · · · If we could put that up.
·8· · · · · · This is Defense Exhibit 97, Your Honor, part of
·9· defense exhibit.
10· · · · · · This is that one-page billing record we have from
11· April the 10th, 1989, from St. Vincent's Medical Center.
12· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Objection again to the use of this
13· document, Your Honor.
14· · · · · · THE COURT:· Overruled.
15· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· We know that she was in the emergency
16· room.· That's what E/R means.· There's her name.· There's the
17· date.· We know that she had two chest x-rays, and we know
18· that she a sonogram of her abdomen or her stomach.
19· · · · · · You know, ladies and gentlemen, from your own
20· experience what happens when you go to the emergency room and
21· you're treated by a doctor.· They take what's called a
22· history.· They ask you questions, and those questions are
23· going to include things like do you drink, do you smoke.
24· · · · · · And when the doctors learned that Mrs. Wilbert
25· smokes, when they learn that she's had a smoker's cough, when
·1· they learn that she has shortness of breath, what do you
·2· think they would tell her?· They would tell her, "Ma'am, you
·3· are damaging your health; you need to quit."
·4· · · · · · It's common sense.· And Judge Covington will
·5· instruct you at the end of the closing arguments that you can
·6· draw reasonable inferences and conclusions from the evidence
·7· based upon what you know your common sense tells you about
·8· how people would behave.
·9· · · · · · But, more importantly, we know that Mrs. Wilbert has
10· a serious lung problem just one year later.
11· · · · · · If we could show that next record, please.
12· · · · · · This is May the 12th, 1990, also St. Vincent's
13· Medical Center.
14· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Same objection, Your Honor.
15· · · · · · THE COURT:· It's overruled.
16· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· On May 12th, Mrs. Wilbert is again
17· admitted to the emergency room.· She's in the hospital for
18· seven days with a serious lung problem.
19· · · · · · And you heard Ms. McCray testify she doesn't
20· remember any of this at all, any of this at all.
21· · · · · · While Mrs. Wilbert is in the hospital, she receives
22· pulmonary tests.· The word "pulmonary" is written there, and
23· "pulmonary" is simply another word that means lung.
24· · · · · · She was given oxygen therapy.· She was given oxygen
25· for three or four days while she was in the hospital, and she
·1· has another chest x-ray.
·2· · · · · · Now, the critical date for purposes of this Question
·3· No. 7 -- the critical date is May the 5th, 1990, just one
·4· week before she is admitted to the emergency room.· You know
·5· when you go to the emergency room and you're admitted for
·6· seven days for a serious lung problem and given oxygen that
·7· injury did not occur overnight.· This is a long-standing
·8· problem, a progressive problem that has been getting worse
·9· over the years.
10· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Same objection, Your Honor.
11· · · · · · THE COURT:· And it's the same ruling.· It's
12· overruled.· They're all overruled, Mr. Heimann.
13· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Well, if --
14· · · · · · THE COURT:· Sir.
15· · · · · · Mr. Geraghty, you may continue.
16· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· Thank you.
17· · · · · · And, of course, Mrs. Wilbert knows or certainly
18· should have known this was a problem for many years.
19· · · · · · Let me remind you what she also told Mr. Tunsil and
20· what Mr. Tunsil told you here in this courtroom.
21· · · · · · If we could show that testimony, please.
22· · · · · · She was asked by Mr. Baringer:· Well, why did she
23· tell you that she needed to stop?· Here's the question:· Was
24· the, quote, I need to stop because of breathing problems the
25· shortness of breath that she was experiencing?
·1· · · · · · ANSWER:· I believe her words were it's not good for
·2· you, and she didn't want me to go through what she was going
·3· through.
·4· · · · · · She didn't want me to go through what she was going
·5· through, this is in 1986.· This is when he first meets her.
·6· Of course, Mrs. Wilbert knew that she had been injured from
·7· smoking cigarettes; she knew that.· That's what she told
·8· Mr. Tunsil.· She didn't want the same thing to happen to him.
·9· · · · · · And remember this is 1986, three years before --
10· four years before the key date of May 5, 1990.
11· · · · · · Now, during Ms. Barnett's examination of Ms. McCray,
12· she had Ms. McCray say two things in response to all of this,
13· neither of which, frankly, makes any sense.
14· · · · · · First, Ms. McCray tried to tell you the one
15· hospitalization in 1989 was for her mother's knee surgery.
16· But the medical records show that Mrs. Wilbert herself told
17· her doctors that her knee surgery occurred in 1982, not 1989.
18· · · · · · If we could show that record.· That's Defense
19· Exhibit 97.
20· · · · · · This is a May 3, 1994, record.· Mrs. Wilbert, she's
21· given a patient history.· They asked her about her past
22· medical history, and she told them that she had -- says RT,
23· right, knee arth, 1982.
24· · · · · · All the attorneys have this medical record, ladies
25· and gentlemen.· It shows that the hospital visit in 1989 had
·1· nothing to do with a knee injury, as Ms. Barnett and
·2· Ms. McCray tried to suggest to you.
·3· · · · · · Second, you heard Ms. McCray say that her mother had
·4· a medical examination conducted by State Farm Insurance when
·5· they applied for the life insurance policy.· This was a life
·6· insurance physical; it was not conducted by a doctor.
·7· · · · · · If we could show that record, please.
·8· · · · · · This is a -- this record is part of the State Farm
·9· life insurance file, Exhibit 96.· They took a short medical
10· history from her, they took her pulse, they took her blood
11· pressure, they drew blood, and they did an EKG.
12· · · · · · None of these tests are the kind of tests that
13· detect serious illnesses like COPD or lung cancer.· The
14· medical examination didn't even reveal -- didn't even reveal
15· that Mrs. Wilbert had lung cancer.· And we know that she had
16· lung cancer at the time of the examination.· In the
17· stipulated facts the court is going to read to you in a few
18· hours, the plaintiff agreed that her mother, Mrs. Wilbert,
19· was diagnosed with her lung cancer in January of 1994, just
20· 45 days after this record.· You heard Dr. Burns tell you on
21· Friday she had a baseball-sized tumor in her lung -- a
22· baseball-sized tumor -- and that tumor had spread throughout
23· her body.· Mrs. Wilbert was ill, and she had been ill for
24· some time, no question about that.
25· · · · · · You can take that down.
·1· · · · · · That brings us to 1993, ladies and gentlemen, and we
·2· know around this time Mrs. Wilbert begins to make a serious
·3· effort to quit.· By saying that, I don't mean to suggest that
·4· this is the first time Mrs. Wilbert ever said she was going
·5· to quit.· She apparently said that a lot.· And she may have
·6· even tried to quit once or twice before then.
·7· · · · · · But did she make a committed effort to quit before
·8· 1993?· Well, I told you a moment ago that Ms. McCray told you
·9· the answer to that question is no.
10· · · · · · If we can show her testimony.
11· · · · · · This is Ms. McCray's testimony on Thursday
12· afternoon:· The truth of the matter is, ma'am, that before
13· 1993 you never actually ever saw your mother stop smoking for
14· a day; isn't that right?
15· · · · · · Her answer was:· Correct.
16· · · · · · Why would Mrs. Wilbert say she was trying to quit?
17· You heard Dr. Cummings tell you that sometimes smokers will
18· say they want to quit but they don't really mean it.· They're
19· trying to get their family and friends off their back.· After
20· all, the evidence you've heard is that Mrs. Wilbert was
21· telling her friends and family for many years:· Mind your own
22· business.· I'm going to do what I want to do.
23· · · · · · I also told you that Ms. McCray has changed her
24· testimony regarding whether her mother actually tried to quit
25· smoking.· And this is another important issue.· In that
·1· very -- in that first verified worksheet, Ms. McCray was
·2· asked:· Did your mom ever try to quit smoking?
·3· · · · · · And she said:· Only a few times.
·4· · · · · · Ms. McCray was also asked to approximate the dates
·5· when her mother quit smoking.· And her answer in the first
·6· worksheet was unknown, meaning "I don't know."· That's what
·7· she said under oath before the trial started.
·8· · · · · · And as you've learned, Ms. McCray has changed her
·9· testimony on this key point several times.
10· · · · · · Later, in a different answer, she identified
11· specific dates where she claims her mother tried to quit.
12· But that story changed.· That story changed even while she
13· was on the witness stand testifying just last Thursday.· Here
14· in the courtroom she told you about episodes where she claims
15· her mother quit smoking that in the entire course of this
16· lawsuit she has never mentioned before, despite having
17· multiple opportunities to do so.
18· · · · · · And this is an important issue, because if
19· Mrs. Wilbert did not make a committed effort to quit in time
20· to avoid developing her lung cancer and the evidence shows
21· that she did not, then addiction is not the legal cause of
22· her cancer and death.· It is her decision not to make a
23· committed effort to quit for so many years.
24· · · · · · But by 1993, as you've heard, she is in bad health.
25· You heard she's coughing a lot in 1993.· She told her
·1· daughter that she had emphysema in July of 1993.· And we know
·2· that she quit smoking for three months in 1993.· We know that
·3· because that's what she told us in that life insurance
·4· application.
·5· · · · · · A few months later, in 1994, Mrs. Wilbert is
·6· diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer, and it's terminal.
·7· There's no cure.· She's treated with her first round of
·8· chemotherapy in April of 1994.· About a week later, on May
·9· the 1st, they start to give her radiation to try to shrink
10· the size of the tumors.· And on May the 3rd, her third day of
11· radiation, Mrs. Wilbert quits smoking again.
12· · · · · · Here is the verified worksheet again.· It's
13· Exhibit 98.· This is what Ms. McCray said under oath.· She
14· was certainly around when this event occurred.· She wrote:
15· My mother, she quit smoking four months prior to her death on
16· her third day of radiation therapy.
17· · · · · · And in this courtroom just a few days ago, she said:
18· I don't remember that.· I don't remember that.
19· · · · · · Well, we know this is true because Mrs. Wilbert told
20· her doctors the same thing on the same day, May the 3rd.
21· · · · · · If we could show that May the 3rd record again.
22· · · · · · This is the record I just showed you a moment ago,
23· that in past surgeries it says right knee arth, right there
24· in the middle.· But if you look below, she's asked whether
25· she's smoking.· It says social Hx.· That's social history.
·1· And it says zero, slash, tobacco.· She's not smoking
·2· cigarettes on May the 3rd, 1994.
·3· · · · · · And other medical records -- if we go to the next
·4· one, the medical records from just a few days earlier -- this
·5· is right before the radiation therapy is about to start --
·6· the doctors say she is in no acute distress, no acute
·7· distress when she quit smoking.
·8· · · · · · And every reference in the records after May the 3rd
·9· refers to Mrs. Wilbert smoking in the past tense.· There is
10· not another record where Mrs. Wilbert at any point after May
11· the 3rd says "I'm still smoking cigarettes."· That's the
12· evidence that was created before this lawsuit was filed.
13· · · · · · Unfortunately, as you heard, her disease continues
14· to progress.· She undergoes additional rounds of chemotherapy
15· after the radiation, and on July 28th, 1994, Mrs. Wilbert
16· passes away from advanced lung cancer.
17· · · · · · Those are the facts.· Those are the facts that
18· you've heard in this courtroom over the last week or so,
19· ladies and gentlemen.
20· · · · · · Now, I told you at the very beginning of this case
21· was about two words:· control and responsibility.· But I
22· think we can add a third word after what you've seen happen
23· in this courtroom over the last week, and that word is
24· credibility, credibility.
25· · · · · · And I want to walk you through the questions on the
·1· verdict form, but before I do that, I want to talk to you
·2· about the burden of proof and this issue of credibility.· I
·3· haven't talked about it yet, but you heard Mr. Heimann.
·4· · · · · · The plaintiff bears the burden of proof on each and
·5· every issue in this case except for Question No. 7, the
·6· statute of limitations question.· The plaintiff bears the
·7· burden not only to bring you evidence but reliable, credible,
·8· believable evidence that proves her case.· And they have
·9· failed to do that here.
10· · · · · · And I want to say something about credibility before
11· we go through the verdict form.· You know there's a very
12· famous U.S. senator who once said everyone is entitled to his
13· own opinion but not to his own set of facts.
14· · · · · · Think about that.· The facts are the facts.· And I
15· told you that Judge Covington would instruct you that one of
16· your jobs in this case is to assess the credibility or the
17· believability of the witnesses.· That is your job and your
18· job alone.
19· · · · · · And rather than paraphrase, I want to read to you
20· exactly what Judge Covington is going to instruct you on this
21· very important point, and I'm reading from the instructions
22· you'll have shortly.
23· · · · · · Judge Covington's going to tell you, quote:· Now, in
24· saying you must consider all of the evidence, I do not mean
25· that you must accept all of the evidence as true or accurate.
·1· You should decide whether you believe what each witness had
·2· to say and how important that testimony was.· In making that
·3· decision, you may believe or disbelieve any witness in whole
·4· or in part.· Also the number of witnesses testifying
·5· concerning any particular dispute is not controlling.
·6· · · · · · The judge will continue to tell you the following,
·7· quote:· In deciding whether you believe or do not believe any
·8· witness, I suggest that you ask yourself a few questions.
·9· Did the witness impress you as one who was telling the truth?
10· Did the witness have any particular reason not to tell the
11· truth?· Did the witness have a personal interest in the
12· outcome of the case -- a personal financial interest in the
13· outcome of the case?
14· · · · · · And the judge will continue -- Judge Covington will
15· tell you you should also ask yourself whether there was
16· evidence tending to prove that the witness testified falsely
17· concerning some important fact or whether there was evidence
18· that at some other time the witness said or did something or
19· failed to say or do something which was different from the
20· testimony the witness gave before you during the trial.
21· · · · · · That's what you're going to be told by the judge.
22· So when you are deciding what testimony you believe in this
23· case, you should think about what you saw happen in the
24· courtroom over the last week or so.
25· · · · · · I've already talked about how Ms. McCray and
·1· Ms. Ellis and Mr. Walker, the people seeking money in this
·2· case, changed their testimony about the brands their mother
·3· smoked.· I already told you how their testimony changed
·4· regarding when and how often their mother tried to quit
·5· smoking.
·6· · · · · · But remember the life insurance application that
·7· Mrs. Wilbert filled out and that Ms. McCray signed.
·8· Ms. McCray signed the very same application in September
·9· of 1993, Defense Exhibit 96.
10· · · · · · If we could put that up there.
11· · · · · · You see at the top -- we've gone through this --
12· Mrs. Wilbert said that she quit smoking for three months, in
13· this application, a fact that you now know is not favorable
14· to the plaintiff's case.· You see down at the bottom it was
15· signed on September 29th, 1993, by both Mercedia Wilbert and
16· Anita Young, Anita McCray.
17· · · · · · When I showed Ms. McCray this application and asked
18· her whether her mother quit smoking for three months in 1993,
19· she said, "I don't know.· I don't remember that."
20· · · · · · Now, there's another question on that insurance
21· application that I asked her about.· Remember I asked her if
22· she would know -- if she would know if her mother had been
23· hospitalized for several days.· And she said, "Of course.· I
24· saw my mom three or four times every single week, and I spoke
25· to her more frequently."
·1· · · · · · I showed her the hospital -- the billing record that
·2· we just looked at from 1989.· I then showed her the billing
·3· record from 1990 that shows Mrs. Wilbert had a lung problem.
·4· · · · · · And what did Ms. McCray tell you?· "I don't remember
·5· any of that either."
·6· · · · · · So I showed her the application.
·7· · · · · · Again, if we could show -- it's Question 18.
·8· · · · · · I showed her the application, and I showed her this
·9· particular question and answer.· Question No. 18:· Have you
10· in the last five years for any reason not previously
11· explained -- and then subpart C says -- been a patient in a
12· hospital or emergency room?
13· · · · · · And on the application, the answer to that question
14· was no.· No.
15· · · · · · I also asked Ms. McCray -- I said, "Your mother told
16· you she had emphysema in July of 1993, right?"
17· · · · · · She said, "Yes, that's what my mother told me."
18· · · · · · I then showed her the application she signed -- same
19· application.· This is another question, No. 16.
20· · · · · · I showed her this question and answer:· Have you in
21· the last ten years had or been treated for -- and under
22· subpart B it says pneumonia, emphysema, or asthma.· And the
23· box again is checked no.
24· · · · · · And Ms. McCray's response was, "Well, my mother
25· didn't tell me that a doctor had diagnosed her with
·1· emphysema."· That was her response.· And she told you that
·2· despite what you've now heard about the smoker's cough and
·3· the shortness of breath going back to 1986, the hospital
·4· stays in 1989 and 1990, and her mother saying I have
·5· emphysema, in July of 1993 --
·6· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· I object.· That's a misstatement of
·7· the testimony.
·8· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· -- Ms. McCray signed this document --
·9· · · · · · THE COURT:· I need to rule on that.· It's overruled.
10· · · · · · As I said, what the lawyers say is not evidence,
11· ladies and gentlemen.
12· · · · · · And, Mr. Geraghty, you should continue with your
13· closing argument.
14· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· Thank you, Your Honor.
15· · · · · · -- Ms. McCray signed this document, the same
16· application, swearing that the information was true and
17· accurate, but you now know it wasn't.
18· · · · · · And in an effort to defend all of these clearly
19· false statements, Ms. McCray's lawyers have said, "Well, the
20· insurance company paid the claim."
21· · · · · · In all of my questioning of Ms. McCray, I never
22· asked her whether or not State Farm paid her the life
23· insurance money.· Her lawyers told you she got paid.· What
24· they didn't tell you was that after Mrs. Wilbert passed away,
25· State Farm did have some questions.· They had questions.
·1· They called Anita McCray on the telephone.
·2· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Your Honor, there's nothing in the
·3· record.
·4· · · · · · THE COURT:· Overruled.
·5· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· It's -- again, it's part of that same
·6· Defense Exhibit 96.· If we could show the next record,
·7· please.
·8· · · · · · The investigators called Anita McCray and they asked
·9· her questions about this.· Did Ms. McCray tell them that her
10· mom had been sick for a while before they applied for the
11· policy?· Did she tell them that her mother had said she had
12· emphysema in July of 1993?
13· · · · · · No.· Here's what she told them.· This was what is
14· written in that file.· Anita said her mother was in good
15· health until February 1994.· That's what she told the
16· insurance company.
17· · · · · · Ladies and gentlemen, what this all shows is that in
18· 1993 and 1994, when one set of facts was convenient, that's
19· what Ms. McCray told State Farm.· And here in 2011 and 2012,
20· when a different set of facts is convenient for purposes of
21· this lawsuit, Ms. McCray has told us all something completely
22· different.
23· · · · · · But the facts are the facts.· You don't get to
24· change them.· Just like the senator said and Judge Covington
25· will tell you at the end of the day, you, ladies and
·1· gentlemen, are the judge of those facts.· You judge those
·2· facts.
·3· · · · · · So what I'd like to do now is walk you through the
·4· particular questions on the verdict form itself.
·5· · · · · · And if we could bring up Question 1, please.
·6· · · · · · This is Question 1 on that verdict form:· Was
·7· Mercedia Wilbert addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?
·8· · · · · · And as I told you in my opening statement, you won't
·9· see a definition of what it means to be addicted.· So what
10· have you heard?· Well, you've heard from two experts brought
11· by the plaintiff, Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns.· They have a
12· very simply definition of addiction:· If you smoke cigarettes
13· every day, you're addicted.· It's that simple.
14· · · · · · And it will be up to you to decide whether that
15· definition is sufficient in a court of law, whether the
16· plaintiff has met her burden, or whether you believe it
17· should take something more.
18· · · · · · What you heard is that both Dr. Cummings and
19· Dr. Burns testify in many cases like this, trying to help
20· plaintiffs just like Anita McCray obtain verdicts against the
21· two companies who are defendants.· And both have been paid
22· extremely well to do that, $1 million for Dr. Cummings by the
23· end of this year, and $2 million already for Dr. Burns.
24· · · · · · Not surprisingly, you heard that both Dr. Burns and
25· Dr. Cummings have testified in each and every case, that the
·1· smoker is addicted.· That's what you heard.
·2· · · · · · Neither one ever met Mrs. Wilbert.· Dr. Cummings
·3· hadn't even read the deposition of Ms. McCray or any of her
·4· brothers and sisters before he was willing to say she's
·5· addicted, she's addicted.· All he needed to know was that she
·6· smoked cigarettes.
·7· · · · · · If you decide the plaintiff has not met her burden
·8· to prove that Mrs. Wilbert was addicted, then you should
·9· answer this question no, and your verdict is for the defense.
10· · · · · · Let me move on now to the second question on the
11· verdict form.· The second question will be:· Was
12· Mrs. Wilbert's addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine a
13· legal cause of her death?
14· · · · · · And I've underlined that phrase "legal cause."· This
15· question really boils down to one issue, and that is
16· quitting.· Was Mrs. Wilbert's addiction so strong, so
17· substantial, that it stood in the way of a committed,
18· determined effort to quit on her part?· Was her addiction so
19· substantial that she was compelled to smoke?
20· · · · · · If you conclude that Mrs. Wilbert could have quit
21· smoking whenever she was motivated and determined to do so,
22· then addiction is not the legal cause of her cancer and
23· death.· It is Mrs. Wilbert's decision to continue smoking in
24· the face of all of the warnings and her decision not to make
25· a committed effort to quit in time to avoid her lung cancer.
·1· That is the only legal cause in this case.
·2· · · · · · And let me pause for a second.· I'd like to give you
·3· an example so you can understand the difference between
·4· medical cause and legal cause.
·5· · · · · · I've told you that cigarette smoking -- we don't
·6· dispute that smoking cigarettes for almost 40 years was the
·7· medical cause of Mercedia Wilbert's cancer.· But legal cause
·8· is a different concept, and let me see if I can explain it to
·9· you.
10· · · · · · Imagine somebody walks across the street and they
11· get hit by a bus.· The medical cause of their injury and
12· their death is they got hit by a bus.· But in order to know
13· what the legal cause is, you need to know more.· You need to
14· know more.· Did the person look at the light?· Was the light
15· green and they walked through a green light when the bus had
16· the right-of-way?· Were they talking on their cell phone when
17· they walked across the street?· Were they texting?· Did
18· they -- were they in a rush?· Were they in a hurry and they
19· didn't look in both directions?· You need to know all of
20· these things to know what is the real legal cause.
21· · · · · · And in this instance, ladies and gentlemen, think
22· about it like this way:· Imagine if somebody told
23· Mrs. Wilbert, back when she was a young girl, do not smoke,
24· do not smoke because some day -- maybe not 20 years, maybe
25· not 30 years, but in 35 years, if you keep crossing this
·1· street, if you keep walking across this street every single
·2· day for 35 years, the bus is going to get you.
·3· · · · · · And when that's the case, ladies and gentlemen, the
·4· legal cause -- the legal cause of her injury and death is not
·5· the bus.· It's the fact that she continued to walk across
·6· that street.· She continued to walk across that street
·7· knowing that bus was there every single time.
·8· · · · · · Now, the plaintiff tried to tell you that nicotine
·9· keeps smokers from quitting, that it somehow changes the
10· brain in a way that people simply can't overcome it.· You
11· heard that mostly through Dr. Cummings.· He was on the stand
12· the longest.
13· · · · · · Now, Dr. Cummings candidly acknowledged that he is
14· in a war against tobacco and he's been engaged in that war
15· for many years.· He told you he carries that war right into
16· this courtroom.· And you may have seen what he does in that
17· war.· He cuts corners.· He shows you snippets of documents
18· without telling you the whole story.· He shows you edited
19· videos that he acknowledges under oath have been taken out of
20· context.· He says things that other scientists don't agree
21· with.· In fact, he won't acknowledge here in this courtroom
22· things that he has written outside the courtroom.
23· · · · · · And when he's not in the courtroom, he publishes
24· things like the brochure that I showed him called "Smart
25· Move."
·1· · · · · · We can show that.
·2· · · · · · This is the brochure that I asked Dr. Cummings
·3· questions about.· It's called "Smart Move."· He wrote it in
·4· 1988 for the American Cancer Society.· This is what
·5· Dr. Cummings tells people about cigarette smoking when he's
·6· not in a courtroom.· He says:· Do you have what it takes to
·7· stop smoking?· There is no magic cure that can help you stop.
·8· Take this short quiz to find out if you have what it takes.
·9· · · · · · Three questions:· No. 1, do you want to stop
10· smoking?· No. 2, are you willing to make some changes in your
11· daily routine?· And, No. 3, are you willing to put up with
12· some uneasy moments after stopping?
13· · · · · · Dr. Cummings says if you can answer yes to all three
14· questions, you can stop, you can stop smoking.· That's what
15· Dr. Cummings tells people when he's not in a courtroom.
16· · · · · · And what else did he tell you?
17· · · · · · If we could show the next slide, please.
18· · · · · · What did he tell you about quitting?· He
19· acknowledged that when a smoker quits, all of the nicotine is
20· gone from their body in three days, three days.· He told you
21· that the worst of the withdrawal symptoms subsides after
22· about three weeks.· He told you that quitting smoking is like
23· learning to ride a bike.· It's going to take more than one
24· try, for sure you're going to fall down, but you have to get
25· right back on the bike and keep pedaling.· It takes
·1· motivation, determination, and persistence.
·2· · · · · · And if you have all of those things -- and those
·3· things come from within each and every one of us, ladies and
·4· gentlemen.· And if you have those things, what did
·5· Dr. Cummings say?
·6· · · · · · If we could show his testimony, please.
·7· · · · · · Dr. Cummings himself admitted on the stand -- I
·8· asked him the following question:· Doctor, you believe that
·9· although it can be difficult to quit, any smoker can quit
10· smoking, correct?
11· · · · · · His answer:· Yes, including Mercedia Wilbert.
12· · · · · · And by being persistent, you heard that 60 million
13· Americans have quit smoking, many of whom Dr. Cummings says
14· are heavily, heavily addicted.· Now, he tried to tell you
15· that those numbers didn't mean anything because many smokers
16· relapse.· But remember when Mr. Baringer got up and asked
17· him, Dr. Cummings, have you actually looked at the underlying
18· data?· The data shows that 90 percent of those 60 million
19· people had quit smoking years ago, years ago, not days, as he
20· suggested.· They didn't relapse.
21· · · · · · And it's for this reason that you heard both of the
22· experts for the plaintiff, both Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns,
23· tell you -- they told you even addicted smokers at the end of
24· the day, even if she is addicted, the smoker is ultimately
25· responsible for her own behavior.· They both admitted that on
·1· the witness stand.
·2· · · · · · And other members of the public health community you
·3· now know say exactly the same thing.· Remember that I asked
·4· Dr. Cummings about Surgeon General Koop.
·5· · · · · · If we could show his -- this is Joint Exhibit 238,
·6· Your Honor.
·7· · · · · · You'll remember that Dr. Koop was the Surgeon
·8· General in 1988 when the report was issued saying cigarette
·9· smoking is addictive.· This is what Surgeon General Koop said
10· in 2002, 14 years later:· When you're engaged in internal
11· warfare with yourself about whether or not to light up a
12· cigarette, you can fortify yourself by remembering this
13· important fact.· Ultimately, you are the one that has control
14· over your behavior.· The cigarette is not going to light
15· itself and jump into your mouth, nor are you going to go into
16· a brain-induced hypnotic trance and light the cigarette.· No
17· matter how much you have smoked or how much you like to
18· smoke, the choice to light up is always yours.
19· · · · · · Dr. Cummings said -- I asked him:· You agree with
20· that, don't you, Dr. Cummings?
21· · · · · · And he said:· Yes, I agree with that.
22· · · · · · And what did we hear from Mrs. Wilbert on this
23· issue?· What did she tell her doctors and State Farm before
24· the lawsuit was filed?· She said that she quit smoking for
25· three months in 1993 -- that's from the insurance
·1· application -- and when she resumed smoking, she was only
·2· smoking a few cigarettes per day.· And she told her doctor
·3· she quit on May 3rd, 1994.
·4· · · · · · So what is the key?· Motivation.· That's what all
·5· the experts say.
·6· · · · · · You know, Mr. Heimann told you during his
·7· presentation -- he said that Ms. McCray accepts
·8· responsibility on behalf of Mrs. Wilbert for the role her
·9· decisions played in causing her own death.· You now know that
10· even after she developed lung cancer Mrs. Wilbert never said
11· she wanted to sue the cigarette companies.· She took full
12· responsibility for her decisions.
13· · · · · · You've now heard the facts.· Ms. McCray claims her
14· mother was addicted, but Mrs. Wilbert's addiction did not
15· force her to smoke.· She smoked because it's what she wanted
16· to do, she enjoyed it, and she didn't make an earnest effort
17· to quit until 1993.· And when she did, she did with some
18· degree of success, but unfortunately it was already too late.
19· · · · · · And that's what the second question --
20· · · · · · If we can put it back up there, please.
21· · · · · · -- is all about.· Mrs. Wilbert was always the one in
22· control of her own actions, not Philip Morris, not
23· R.J. Reynolds, not the nicotine in cigarettes.
24· · · · · · So if you get to this point, the answer to this
25· question is clearly no, Mrs. Wilbert's addiction was not the
·1· legal cause of her lung cancer.· And if you answer no to this
·2· question, your verdict is for the defendants and the case is
·3· over, the case is over.
·4· · · · · · Now, I don't think you're going to get this far, but
·5· let me talk to you about some of the other questions on the
·6· verdict form.
·7· · · · · · THE CLERK:· You have ten minutes.
·8· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· Until an hour and thirty?
·9· · · · · · THE CLERK:· You have one twenty.
10· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· I think I had two hours but asked for
11· the warning at an hour twenty.· Thank you.
12· · · · · · The next four questions, 3, 4, 5, and 6, all ask
13· whether something done by Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds was
14· a legal cause of Mrs. Wilbert's death.· And I'm going to deal
15· with these next four questions in sets, so let's look at
16· Question 3 and 4.
17· · · · · · 3, please state as to each defendant whether the
18· negligence on the part of the defendant was a legal cause of
19· Mrs. Wilbert's death.
20· · · · · · Question 4 then says:· Please state as to each
21· defendant whether each defendant's placement of cigarettes on
22· the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous was
23· a legal cause of Mrs. Wilbert's death.
24· · · · · · I've already discussed legal cause with you, so I'm
25· not going to repeat that.· But let me say first the evidence
·1· you've heard during this trial was that the primary brand
·2· Mrs. Wilbert smoked for many years was Kent cigarettes.· I've
·3· gone through that testimony with you already.· You know that
·4· Kent cigarettes are not made by Philip Morris or
·5· R.J. Reynolds.
·6· · · · · · Plaintiff has to prove that some negligent act by
·7· Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds or some defect in cigarettes
·8· made by these companies was a legal cause of her death.· But
·9· she's failed to prove that she smoked our cigarettes on a
10· regular basis for a significant period of time.· For that
11· reason alone, for that reason alone, the answer to these two
12· questions should be no.
13· · · · · · Now, plaintiff raised several issues during the
14· trial, and I'd like to respond to those.· Mr. Heimann
15· mentioned it and you heard Dr. Cummings talk about filter and
16· light cigarettes.· You also heard about something called
17· compensation.· The evidence you heard was that none of those
18· things had any impact whatsoever on Mrs. Wilbert.
19· · · · · · Let me start with compensation.· That's the notion
20· that when somebody who switches from a high-tar-and-nicotine
21· cigarette to a light or low-tar-and-nicotine cigarette, he or
22· she might smoke more cigarettes or inhale more deeply.· And
23· you heard no evidence that suggests Mrs. Wilbert ever smoked
24· more cigarettes after she switched brands.· You heard nothing
25· to that effect.
·1· · · · · · The only time you heard that she smoked more
·2· cigarettes, when she was dealing with a particularly
·3· stressful situation.· In fact, Ms. McCray admitted that later
·4· in her life her mom was smoking fewer cigarettes, less than
·5· half a pack a day.· Mrs. Wilbert was smoking a filtered
·6· cigarette from the very beginning.· Kent cigarettes, that's
·7· what you saw in the verified worksheet.· She never switched
·8· from a high-tar-and-nicotine cigarette to a
·9· low-tar-and-nicotine cigarette.· She simply did not engage in
10· this compensation that Mr. Heimann wants you to believe.
11· · · · · · Dr. Cummings also talked about filters and how many
12· smokers switched to filters for health reasons.· That's not
13· Mrs. Wilbert.· She often asked her children to buy her
14· cigarettes at the store.· If she had any consideration about
15· what brand was being bought, you heard what it was.· It was
16· price.· How much are they going to cost?· She never said,
17· "Make sure you get the filtered cigarettes because they're
18· safer."· She wanted a cigarette.
19· · · · · · And as for light cigarettes, you heard it from
20· Ms. McCray on Thursday her mother barely smoked light
21· cigarettes.· The only brand she apparently smoked on any kind
22· of a regular basis was Kent Golden Lights, made by a company
23· she's not suing in this case.
24· · · · · · You heard a little bit about Winston Light.
25· Ms. McCray told you she saw her mother smoke this brand a few
·1· times but only when her mother was out of her usual brand and
·2· bummed or borrowed a cigarette from a neighbor.
·3· · · · · · You heard all this testimony from Dr. Cummings about
·4· compensation, filter cigarettes, and light cigarettes, and it
·5· has absolutely nothing to do with Mrs. Wilbert.
·6· · · · · · Plaintiff has simply failed to prove that some
·7· negligent act by Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds was the legal
·8· cause of Mrs. Wilbert's death.· She's failed to prove that
·9· some defect in their cigarettes were a legal cause of her
10· death.· All you've heard is that cigarettes are addictive and
11· that cigarettes can cause cancer.· And we acknowledged that
12· at the very beginning of the case, ladies and gentlemen.
13· That was never in dispute.
14· · · · · · That is simply not sufficient to prove what the
15· plaintiff needs to prove for these two questions -- these two
16· questions.· The fact that they can be addictive, the fact
17· that they can cause cancer, those are inherent qualities of
18· tobacco itself.· So if you get to Question 3 and 4, your
19· answer should be no as to both defendants.
20· · · · · · If we could move to the next two questions, please.
21· · · · · · These are the two questions -- 5 and 6, they're the
22· reliance questions that I told you about.· And, frankly,
23· ladies and gentlemen, there is a lot of language in there,
24· and it's probably easier for you to go back in the jury room
25· and read it.· But I highlighted what I think is the key
·1· language:· relied to her detriment and whether such reliance
·2· was a legal cause of her death.
·3· · · · · · And I have a chart that I think kind of explains
·4· what this means.
·5· · · · · · If we could show that.
·6· · · · · · For legal cause to apply here, you'll see the words
·7· "direct and substantial" in the instruction.· So for some
·8· statement to have influenced Mrs. Wilbert, there must be a
·9· direct connection -- did she see it?· Did she hear it?· Did
10· she read it? -- and a substantial impact -- did it influence
11· her decision? -- before you can find that it is the legal
12· cause of her injury.
13· · · · · · And there's no evidence, ladies and gentlemen, no
14· evidence that she ever -- no reliable evidence that she ever
15· saw, heard, or read any statement about smoking and health
16· from any cigarette manufacturer.
17· · · · · · You heard about Mrs. Wilbert and the way she lived
18· her life.· Think about that.· From a very young age she did
19· not follow her parents' strict rules.· She told friends and
20· loved ones:· Mind your own business.· I'm going to do what I
21· want to do.
22· · · · · · She didn't listen to what anyone told her about how
23· she should live her life, not her parents, not her
24· ex-spouses, not her children, and certainly not a cigarette
25· company.
·1· · · · · · Dr. Cummings spent a lot of time talking about a
·2· so-called controversy.· But to Mrs. Wilbert there was no
·3· controversy.· She never said she was confused.· She told her
·4· family:· I'm going to do what I want to do.
·5· · · · · · So if you get to these two questions --
·6· · · · · · If we could go back just briefly, Question No. 5 and
·7· 6.
·8· · · · · · -- the answers to these questions for both Philip
·9· Morris and R.J. Reynolds should be no.· And if you answer no
10· to 3, 4, 5, and 6, your verdict again is for the defendants
11· and the case is over.
12· · · · · · If we could move to the next slide, please.
13· · · · · · If you disagree with anything I've said thus far
14· about the first series of questions, then you will proceed to
15· Question No. 7.· This is that statute of limitations question
16· I've already talked about.· It says:· Please state whether
17· Mrs. Wilbert knew or should have known in the exercise of
18· reasonable care before May 5, 1990, that she had been injured
19· and that there was a reasonable possibility that her injury
20· was caused by cigarette smoking.
21· · · · · · And I want to let you know we bear the burden of
22· proof.· The defendants bear the burden of proof on this
23· particular issue.· I've already discussed the evidence, but
24· let me emphasize a few points.
25· · · · · · Judge Covington will instruct you and I'd like to
·1· just briefly read the instruction to you.· She will instruct
·2· you that the defendants do not need to prove that
·3· Mrs. Wilbert was actually diagnosed with a smoking-related
·4· injury before May 5, 1990, to prevail on this defense.· For
·5· purposes of this defense, the critical event is not when a
·6· disease or medical condition was actually diagnosed by a
·7· physician, but when the disease or medical condition first
·8· manifested itself.
·9· · · · · · And that makes sense, ladies and gentlemen,
10· because -- as I told you, we have questions like this because
11· due to the passage of time, evidence and medical records are
12· lost.· So you don't have to prove -- we don't have to prove a
13· specific medical diagnosis in the case.
14· · · · · · So what does it mean when a disease manifests
15· itself?· What are we talking about here?· It simply means
16· does the person have symptoms that would lead a reasonably
17· intelligent person to believe that in this case cigarette
18· smoking had caused an injury.· Did Mrs. Wilbert have symptoms
19· that would lead her to suspect that her health had been
20· harmed and that smoking could be the cause?· If she knew or
21· should have known that she had suffered from an injury and
22· smoking was likely the cause, then the answer to this
23· question should be yes.
24· · · · · · And what I'd like to do, if you could put the -- do
25· you have the time line there?· This is just for demonstrative
·1· purposes.
·2· · · · · · The time line of events is key here, ladies and
·3· gentlemen.· The time line of events is key.· You heard
·4· about --
·5· · · · · · MR. HEIMANN:· Excuse me.· I object once again, Your
·6· Honor, the same basis I've been objecting all along.
·7· · · · · · THE COURT:· Overruled.
·8· · · · · · MR. GERAGHTY:· We've already walked through it.
·9· There was a warning on every pack of cigarettes Mrs. Wilbert
10· bought in 1985, saying smoking causes emphysema.
11· · · · · · In 1986 -- you heard Mr. Tunsil's testimony -- she
12· had a smoker's cough and shortness of breath.
13· · · · · · April of 1989, admitted to the ER at St. Vincent's.
14· · · · · · The key date is May 5, 1990.· And on May the 12th,
15· just one week later, she's admitted for lung problems.
16· · · · · · Two key facts you should keep in mind:· One is that
17· warning, that warning that tells her smoking causes
18· emphysema, a lung problem with shortness of breath and
19· coughing.· And then the other thing that's key is the
20· testimony of Mr. Donald Tunsil, which I'd like to remind you
21· of again.
22· · · · · · If we could put that up, please.
23· · · · · · This is Mr. Tunsil.· In 1986, when he met her, she
24· had a smoker's cough back then, didn't she?
25· · · · · · ANSWER:· Yes.· And she would sort of pound on her
·1· chest to get her breath back because she was short of breath
·2· at the time.· I remember her pounding her chest.
·3· · · · · · Then I think we have the next passage as well.
·4· · · · · · And what did she say?· What did Mrs. Wilbert say to
·5· Mr. Tunsil about the reasons why she needed to stop?· Was
·6· the, quote, I need to stop because of breathing problems, the
·7· shortness of breath that she was experiencing?
·8· · · · · · He says:· I believe her words were it's not good for
·9· you, and she didn't want me to go through what she was going
10· through.
11· · · · · · Ladies and gentlemen, that's her acknowledging to
12· Mr. Tunsil in 1986 that she knows her cigarette smoking has
13· harmed her health.· She knows it.· But all we need to prove
14· is that she knew or that she should have known in the
15· exercise of reasonable care.
16· · · · · · And you know that she went to see doctors in '89 and
17· '90, and you know based on your common sense what those
18· doctors would have told her when she told them what her
19· symptoms were and she was a cigarette smoker.
20· · · · · · The answer to Question No. 7 is clearly yes.
21· · · · · · If we could go back to that one more time.
22· · · · · · The answer to this question is clearly yes.· She
23· knew or should have known she had an injury caused by smoking
24· before May 5, 1990.· Again, if you answer this question, your
25· verdict is for the defendants.
·1· · · · · · Take that down.
·2· · · · · · If you all disagree with me about the answer to that
·3· question, the next question on the verdict form asks you to
·4· assign a percentage of fault to Mrs. Wilbert, Philip Morris,
·5· and R.J. Reynolds.
·6· · · · · · Now, again, I don't think you get this far, but if
·7· you get here, it's your job to decide at the end of the day
·8· what is personal responsibility all about.· You heard that
·9· the plaintiff has admitted that Mrs. Wilbert was responsible,
10· but they don't want to agree that she is 100 percent
11· responsible.
12· · · · · · What does it mean to say we're responsible for the
13· decisions and lifestyle choices we make?· Let me give you an
14· example.· You know, if any of you have ever drank alcohol,
15· I'm sure you've had maybe an occasion or two -- I'm sure not
16· many -- where you go out and you have a few drinks too many
17· and you wake up the next day and you have a hangover.· You
18· wake up, you go to the mirror, you rub your eyes, your
19· bleary, bloodshot eyes, you feel the pounding headache, and
20· you look in the mirror.· And how many of you say, you know
21· what?· I'm only 20 percent responsible for the hangover.· No
22· one says that, ladies and gentlemen, no one says that.
23· · · · · · Was there anybody else responsible for
24· Mrs. Wilbert's decisions?· The answer is absolutely not, and
25· that's the question you need to ask yourself.· The facts show
·1· that Mrs. Wilbert got up every day, she made her own
·2· decisions, and no one else made them for her.
·3· · · · · · The next issue I want to address very briefly is
·4· damages.· And, again, I don't think you will get to this
·5· question, but if you decide that Ms. McCray, Ms. Ellis, and
·6· Mr. Walker are entitled to recover money for the decisions
·7· that their mother and only their mother made, you have to
·8· decide the amount of money that should be given.· You just
·9· heard Mr. Heimann ask you for $10 million on behalf of each
10· one of these children.· Based on what you've heard, ladies
11· and gentlemen, this isn't a case involving millions or even
12· hundreds of thousands of dollars.· And that's all I'm going
13· to say about it.
14· · · · · · The final question on the verdict form asks whether
15· or not you believe the plaintiffs are entitled to receive
16· punitive damages.· Again, I don't believe you get there, but
17· let me make three brief points in the event you do.
18· · · · · · Punitive damages would be additional money over and
19· above whatever you may decide is fair compensation to
20· Ms. McCray and her brother and sister.· In this phase of the
21· case, you're only deciding whether they're entitled to
22· receive that additional money.· And if you say yes, there
23· will be a separate phase of the case, the parties may present
24· additional evidence, and you'll hear further argument.
25· · · · · · Second, it's important to understand that the
·1· plaintiff's burden of proof on this issue is much higher than
·2· that preponderance of the evidence standard.· The judge will
·3· tell you it's called clear and convincing evidence.· It's a
·4· much higher standard.· It's got to be so clear that as soon
·5· as you hear it you have a firm conviction without any
·6· hesitation that you know the answer to the question.· You
·7· haven't heard evidence like this during this case.
·8· · · · · · And, third, the conduct that you can consider is
·9· only conduct that relates specifically to Mrs. Wilbert.
10· You'll see that in the very first part of the instruction.
11· If it doesn't relate to Mrs. Wilbert, it's not important to
12· your deliberations.
13· · · · · · And the important thing I want to highlight here is
14· that this is not a case about all cigarette smokers or the
15· general public.· This case is about Mrs. Wilbert.· And based
16· on the evidence you have heard, Philip Morris and
17· R.J. Reynolds had nothing to do with the decisions she made
18· in her life, including her decision to smoke cigarettes.· If
19· you get to this question, the answer in this case should be
20· clearly no.
21· · · · · · Now, I'm going to wrap up in, I promise you, a
22· minute or two.· And I just want to tell you that you have
23· been extremely attentive and very patient during my
24· presentation.· I really appreciate that.
25· · · · · · And before I sit down, I'd like to say just one more
·1· thing to you.· After I'm finished, you're going to get to
·2· hear from Mr. Baringer on behalf of R.J. Reynolds, and then
·3· Mr. Heimann is going to have the opportunity one last time to
·4· stand up, because the plaintiff has the burden of proof, so
·5· he gets the last word.
·6· · · · · · And I don't know what Mr. Heimann will say to you,
·7· but he may show you more documents.· I'm certain that he
·8· will.· And as you listen to Mr. Heimann and he shows you
·9· these documents, ask yourself one question:· What does any of
10· this have to do with Mrs. Wilbert?· What does any of this
11· have to do with the way she chose to live her life and the
12· things that she did?
13· · · · · · The evidence that we've walked through now over the
14· better part of an hour or so summarizes several things.
15· Mrs. Wilbert was raised by a strict family and told at a very
16· young age do not smoke.· She received multiple, multiple
17· warnings about cigarette smoking:· on the packs, from her
18· friends and family, from her children.· She smoked because it
19· was something she enjoyed doing, and she was willing to take
20· the chance.· She told her daughter it's not going to happen
21· to me.
22· · · · · · For many, many years she smoked a cigarette made by
23· a company who she's not suing in this case.· And she quit
24· smoking and demonstrated to everyone that she could quit
25· smoking when she was truly motivated to do so.
·1· Unfortunately, at that point it was too late for her.
·2· · · · · · You know, ladies and gentlemen, we enjoy a
·3· tremendous amount of freedom in this country.· We believe in
·4· a concept called free will.· We believe in the right to make
·5· decisions for ourselves, including decisions about how we
·6· live our lives.· And you all know that with that freedom
·7· comes the obligation to accept personal responsibility for
·8· the consequences of those decisions, and in the end that's
·9· what this case is really about.
10· · · · · · Are we going to hold Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds
11· responsible for Mrs. Wilbert's decisions, decisions she made
12· over the course of 35 or 40 years, for the way she chose to
13· live her life?
14· · · · · · I submit to you that the evidence in this case shows
15· that Mrs. Wilbert was always in control of her own decisions;
16· her own decisions were the one and the only legal cause of
17· her cancer and death in this case; and for that reason the
18· evidence you've heard over the better part of the last week
19· supports one and only one verdict, and that is a verdict in
20· favor of Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
21· · · · · · I want to thank you very much for your time and
22· attention.· It has truly been a pleasure to be able to
23· present this case to you.
24· · · · · · Thank you.
