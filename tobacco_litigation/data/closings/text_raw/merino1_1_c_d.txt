6     MR. REILLY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
7     Let me introduce the jury to Dan Gardner.
8 Dan, this is the guy that prepared all my slides
9 and so he knows the order that they're in.  And
10 I get lost and so he's going to help me out.
11     And as you can see, I've jumped into the
12 19th century by using the ELMO instead of
13 boards, but it's really a function of how much
14 space I have to operate in.  So you're saved all
15 the mechanics of hauling boards around.
16     I'm going to start my closing argument the
17 way I started my opening statement, and that is
18 by thanking you guys for your service as jurors.
19 We all know that this has been a sacrifice by
20 all of you, but we all appreciate it, I'm
21 talking on behalf of myself and Miranda, but,
22 quite frankly, I'm sure that everyone is
23 included in that thanks.  So let me start there.
24     And let me then go into the next thing I
25 said, and that is, out of respect for your 3203
1 sacrifice I said that Miranda and I would use
2 your time, as far as we were concerned, our
3 evidence was concerned, as efficiently as we
4 knew how to do it.  And, frankly, I think we
5 did.  We put our evidence on in about a day and
6 a half.  And we got to the real facts, the real
7 issues and the real evidence in the case.  I
8 know I can talk a lot faster.  I could talk a
9 lot louder.  But that's just not how this is
10 going to happen, so...
11     What I really want to do -- and let me start
12 off by saying, you know what, this is not a case
13 about the general public.  This is not a case
14 about what causes most people to get sick,
15 whether it's smoking or something else.  This is
16 a case about one person and one person only,
17 right.  And you know who that person is.  And
18 that person is the plaintiff in this case.
19     So what I want to focus on are the actual
20 questions that Judge Cueto is going to give you
21 that relate to the plaintiff in this case,
22 Ms. Merino, and to then focus on the actual
23 evidence that relates to each one of those
24 issues that came in during the course of the
25 trial of the case. 3204
1     So let's start with the questions that --
2 can everybody see that?
3     Am I standing in the way of somebody?
4     Let me head over here.
5     So Mr. Rosenblum said that the first
6 question is related to class membership, whether
7 or not Ms. Merino is actually a member of the
8 Engle class.  And they do.  And although they
9 appear a little differently on the verdict form,
10 the three questions are kind of bunched
11 together.  So the three questions are about
12 whether her smoking cigarettes was a legal cause
13 of her oral cancer, that's number one.
14     Number two, whether she was addicted to
15 American cigarettes containing nicotine.  That's
16 number two.
17     And number three is whether or not such
18 addiction, if she was addicted, was a legal
19 cause of why she developed oral cancer.
20     Now, let's start with who has the burden of
21 proof on every one of those issues?  You know
22 the answer to that.  The burden of proof is on
23 the plaintiff.  So if any of those issues at the
24 end of all this argument, all this evidence, if
25 any of those issues are unresolved in your mind, 3205
1 who didn't carry their burden of proof?  Well,
2 you know the answer to it.
3     All right.  So let's look at the first
4 question.
5     Was smoking cigarettes a legal cause of
6 Ms. Merino's oral cancer?  Yes or no.
7     Well, the phrase that ought to just jump out
8 at you but probably doesn't is that one right
9 there, "legal cause."
10     You really haven't heard anything about
11 legal cause yet in a discussion by plaintiff
12 counsel in this case.
13     So what does -- what is the burden of the
14 plaintiffs, Ms. Merino and her lawyers, in terms
15 of establishing that smoking cigarettes was a
16 legal cause of her oral cavity cancer?
17     Well, Judge Cueto when he gives you the
18 instructions is going to read a very complicated
19 instruction about legal cause.  It's filled with
20 legal terms.  Law students study three years in
21 law school to try to figure out what this all
22 means and we ask you guys to come in off the
23 street from your normal jobs and understand it.
24     But I'm going to walk through it and I'm
25 going to point out the really important words so 3206
1 that you understand the concept of legal cause.
2     What Judge Cueto is going to instruct you is
3 that smoking cigarettes was a legal cause of
4 oral cancer, it's Ms. Merino's oral cancer, if
5 it directly and in natural and continuous
6 sequence produced or contributed substantially
7 to producing the oral cancer such that but for
8 smoking cigarettes the oral cancer would not
9 have occurred.
10     That's the key language, "but for smoking
11 cigarettes her oral cancer would not have
12 occurred."  What's another way of saying that?
13 If she'd never smoked she wouldn't have gotten
14 oral cancer.  That's it.  That's it.  That's
15 what they have to have proved to you.
16     Now, how does this issue come up in this
17 case?  Is this something that Philip Morris
18 created?  Heck no.  You know where it came from.
19 It came from the pathology report created by
20 Dr. Saldana, Dr. Mario Saldana way back in 1996.
21     Now, you remember who Dr. Saldana was.  He
22 was the treating pathologist.  Wasn't involved
23 in Ms. Merino's care because of a lawsuit, he
24 wasn't interested in 16 million dollars.  What
25 was his interest?  His interest was in 3207
1 determining whether or not Ms. Merino had oral
2 cavity cancer and if he could determine it, what
3 caused it.  That was his task.
4     And you know from the pages of the pathology
5 report how carefully he performed his task.  And
6 that's no surprise in light of the fact that you
7 now know, after listening to Dr. Blaustein, that
8 Dr. Saldana was a professor of pathology at the
9 University of Miami School of Medicine.  You
10 know how careful he was in performing this task.
11     And you've seen this, this part of the
12 pathology report, section 8, in which he raises
13 and answers the question as best we can know at
14 this time what was wrong with her and what
15 caused it.  And he had no 16 million dollar
16 stake in this case.
17     And what did he say?  He said,
18 "koilocytic -- koilocytotic atypia suggestive of
19 the human papilloma virus infection."  Now, did
20 Philip Morris put that in there?  Absolutely
21 not.  You know who did it.
22     It's interesting -- may I have that back for
23 just a second, pathology report.
24     It was really interesting.  Why did I bring
25 you Dr. Blaustein?  I told you I would be 3208
1 economic.  I told you I would be efficient.  I
2 brought him here for one reason only, really,
3 and that was to let you know what it is that
4 Dr. Saldana was communicating to the caregivers
5 that were taking care of Ms. Merino way back in
6 1996.  And why did I bring him?  Because he's
7 the guy that knew Dr. Saldana.  He's the guy
8 that actually was educated by Dr. Saldana.  He's
9 the guy that when he came here to southern
10 Florida when he was over at Mount Sinai,
11 Dr. Blaustein would send cases, his most
12 difficult head and neck cancer cases for a
13 second opinion over to Dr. Saldana.  He read
14 countless pathology reports from Dr. Saldana.
15 And you know that he came here and he said --
16 this is exactly what he said.
17     I asked him, based on your experience
18 dealing with Dr. Saldana and reading his
19 pathology reports, what was he saying?
20     He said, "But on top of that he's stating
21 here that there are changes which he has found
22 as a pathologist and where he has a particular
23 interest that shows changes that are suggestive,
24 in his words, but I -- of human papilloma virus.
25 In other words, what he's telling the 3209
1 clinician,, the oncologist, is that, look,
2 there's cancer here.  There's not a question
3 about that, but these findings, in fact, are
4 really -- really saying that in this case from a
5 pathologic interpretation the papilloma virus is
6 etiologic or causative of this woman's cancer."
7     Now, who disputed that?  The only person who
8 disputed that was their Dr. Westra.  And
9 remember I asked Dr. Westra, Dr. Westra, a month
10 ago, six weeks ago you had no idea what was in
11 the mind, that's what you told us a month -- six
12 weeks ago when you gave your deposition, you had
13 no idea what was in the mind of Dr. Saldana.
14 But today when you came into this courtroom you
15 had this wondrous idea that you had come up with
16 that Dr. Saldana was trying to communicate that
17 there's nothing wrong here, surgeon, be happy,
18 don't worry.  That's why I brought you
19 Dr. Blaustein.  Because Dr. Blaustein came here
20 and told you what?  He told you that Dr. Saldana
21 meant exactly what he said, that because of his
22 observation of koilocytotic atypia suggestive of
23 the human papilloma virus he was telling the
24 caregivers of Ms. Merino what he thought was the
25 explanation for why she got her oral cavity 3210
1 cancer.
2     Now, we brought you Dr. Juan Felix.  Miranda
3 put him on the stand.  Dr. Felix is one of the
4 leading authorities in the world on human
5 papilloma virus.  It has been his area of study
6 for the last 30 years.  Yes, it's true, he was
7 involved in the creation of the vaccine that
8 prevents women from getting cervical cancer
9 today.
10     Dr. Felix came here and explained to you
11 things like -- and we're going to go through
12 each one of the building blocks of why it is
13 that most probably in this case, highly likely
14 in this case, that Ms. Merino's oral cavity
15 cancer was caused by her exposure to human
16 papilloma virus, and we're going to show you who
17 agrees with every one of those building blocks.
18 Because you know who agrees with every one of
19 the building blocks?  The world's leading public
20 health organizations that specialize in cancer.
21 The National Cancer Institute and the
22 International Agency for the Research of Cancer,
23 among others.  But we'll walk through it.
24     You know, the first position -- the first
25 question that arises is, does the human 3211
1 papilloma virus cause cancer?  Well, there
2 wasn't any dispute as to whether or not the
3 human papilloma virus causes cancer in the human
4 body.  Everybody that came here, their
5 Dr. Califano, their Dr. Westra and of course
6 Dr. Felix all agreed that, yeah, it causes 99
7 percent of the cervical cancers, 85 percent of
8 the cancers that occur in the back of your
9 mouth, from the back one-third all the way back
10 to the back of your mouth.  And they all agreed,
11 85 percent of those, and they all agreed that
12 how did that human papilloma virus get in your
13 mouth?  It came in through the front of your
14 mouth.  It had to pass through the first
15 two-thirds of your mouth to get to the back of
16 your mouth.  And nobody disputed that.
17     When Dr. Felix came here, he explained to
18 you that, yes, the human papilloma virus causes
19 oral cavity cancer.  Now, that was a big bone of
20 contention between Dr. Westra, Dr. Califano,
21 Dr. Felix.  Dr. Westra said, you know what, it
22 has not been proven to my satisfaction that oral
23 cancer can even be caused by the human papilloma
24 virus.
25     Dr. Califano said, well, I think it can, but 3212
1 it would be quite rare, quite rare.
2     But let's see who agreed with Dr. Felix
3 about that issue of whether or not human
4 papilloma virus causes oral cancer.  Well, in
5 fact, the National Cancer Institute says yes.
6 And here's the actual document that says that.
7 This comes from the National Cancer Institute
8 website general information about oral cancer.
9 Risk factors for oral cancer include the
10 following, "being infected with a certain type
11 of human papilloma virus (HPV)."
12     So there's the National Cancer Institute,
13 the largest cancer organization in this country.
14     Now, how about the largest cancer
15 organization in the world?  The International
16 Agency for the Research of Cancer.  Here's their
17 publication from 2012, the IARC monographs on
18 "Biological Agents:  A Review of Human
19 Carcinogens."
20     "There is sufficient evidence in humans for
21 the carcinogenicity," that's the
22 cancer-causingness, "of the human papilloma
23 virus 16 causes cancer in the oral cavity."
24 Oral cavity.  The International Agency for the
25 Research of Cancer agrees with Dr. Felix, it 3213
1 agrees with Dr. Felix when -- by the way,
2 Dr. Blaustein also agreed that human papilloma
3 virus causes oral cancer.  That was on
4 cross-examination.
5     And you know, maybe, maybe the most
6 embarrassing supporter of this concept that oral
7 cancers are caused by the human papilloma virus
8 was the Johns Hopkins medical organization where
9 Drs. Westra and Califano both came from.
10 Because you remember, I showed them this from
11 the Johns Hopkins Medicine.  Oral and
12 oropharyngeal cancers.  Human papilloma virus,
13 HPV infection, "HPV usually causes warts and has
14 been linked to cervical, vaginal and penile
15 cancers.  HPV also increases the risk for
16 cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx."
17     That's their own medical organization.  What
18 did Dr. Westra have to say about that?  I
19 disagree with that.  I disagree with my own, my
20 own Johns Hopkins website.
21     And does it make sense?  Does it make sense
22 that if the human papilloma virus is going to
23 cause 85 percent of the cancers that occur right
24 there that it can cause cancers before it gets
25 there? 3214
1     Well, there you have Johns Hopkins, National
2 Cancer Institute and the International Agency
3 for the Research of Cancer which disagree flat
4 out with Dr. Westra, flat out.
5     Why is it so?  Why is it that HPV causes
6 cancer in those sites?  You heard Dr. Felix
7 explain this to you.  Dr. Felix said, you know
8 what, the tissue, the skin that makes up a
9 woman's cervix, your anus, your penis, the back
10 of your mouth and the front of your mouth is all
11 the same.  It's called squamous epithelium.
12     Who agrees with that?
13     The National Cancer Institute, and I'll show
14 you the document here in just a minute, says
15 those tissues are all the same.  The National
16 Cancer Institute agrees with Dr. Felix.
17     Who disagreed?
18     Dr. Westra.  I think that's misspelled.  And
19 Dr. Califano.  I told you he couldn't spell.
20     Handsome, yes; good speller, no.
21     All right.  This is from the National Cancer
22 Institute.  I don't know if that's big enough
23 for everybody, "In addition to the use of
24 tobacco products, viral infection is
25 increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of 3215
1 oral cancer.  Oral cancer bears significant
2 resemblance to other mucosal epithelial cancers
3 such as cancer of the cervix and anus --
4     VIDEO TECH:  I'm sorry.
5     MR. REILLY:  Sabotage.  Sabotage.  Judge, I
6 need 30 seconds.
7     "...such as cancers of the cervix and anus,
8 both of which have been associated with
9 infection with human papilloma virus."
10     All the same kind of tissues.
11     All right.  Now, Mr. Rosenblum spent a great
12 deal of time speaking very quickly about how
13 there was no evidence that the human papilloma
14 virus was in Ms. Merino.  But that's not right.
15 You remember in my opening statement I said
16 you're going to hear in this case that there's
17 such a thing as koilocytes, in this particular
18 instance, koilocytic atypia, and that you are
19 going to learn that that was pathognomonic,
20 that's the term, that's the medical term,
21 pathognomonic for the human papilloma virus.
22 What did pathognomonic mean?  It meant that when
23 you see it, it's just like a fingerprint, you
24 don't see my finger, but if you look at the
25 fingerprint you know my finger had to be there. 3216
1     Now, who agreed that koilocytes are
2 pathognomonic for HPV?  Well, of course
3 Dr. Felix and Dr. Saldana did.  Dr. Felix came
4 and testified to it.  Dr. Saldana did by writing
5 his pathology report the way he did.  He said,
6 look, I see koilocytic atypia, that suggests to
7 me human papilloma virus.
8     Dr. Westra -- you don't know how to spell
9 his name -- and Dr. Califano both said, no, no,
10 that doesn't tell me anything.
11     Here again is the National Cancer Institute
12 right off their website.  "The relationship
13 between HPV infection and oral cancer was first
14 described in 1983 when cytopathic changes of HPV
15 infection," and there this it is right there,
16 "(koilocytosis) similar to those seen in
17 cervical HPV infection were noted in oral
18 lesions."
19     That's the National Cancer Institute.  And
20 that's on their website today.
21     How about the International Agency for the
22 Research of Cancer?
23     "The koilocyte is" -- and they use exactly
24 the language I just told you.  "The koilocyte is
25 pathognomonic for HPV."  It's the fingerprint. 3217
1     Now, Dr. Felix said, Dr. Saldana said HPV.
2 It's true that in 1996 hospitals around here
3 didn't do -- didn't have a readily available
4 test to establish that there was HPV in the
5 tumor, but Dr. Saldana, Dr. Felix, the
6 International Agency for Cancer and the National
7 Cancer Institute all tell you right now today
8 HPV -- koilocytic changes are pathognomonic for
9 HPV.
10     Does HPV cause oral cancers?
11     Oh, my goodness.  No.
12     HPV-caused cancers are increasing.  Who says
13 that?  And I'm talking about in the oral cavity,
14 not in general.  I'm talking about in the oral
15 cavity.  Who says that?  Dr. Felix, Cancer Care
16 Ontario, the National Cancer Institute.
17     Dr. Westra is still stuck in his misspelled
18 state of it's not proven to me that it ever
19 causes it.  And Dr. Califano says no.
20     Again, from the National Cancer Institute
21 general information about oral cancer.
22     This is off their website today.  You can't
23 go there because you're jurors, but tomorrow you
24 could.  "The number of new cases and deaths from
25 oral cancer has slowly decreased over the past 3218
1 30 years.  However, the number of new cases of
2 oral cancer caused by certain types of human
3 papilloma virus infection has increased.  One
4 kind of HPV, called HPV 16, is often passed from
5 one person to another during sexual activity."
6     Remember Dr. Westra said, you know what, at
7 Hopkins we don't even test for it because
8 there's no reason to test for it.  It hasn't
9 even been proven to occur.  You heard
10 Dr. Blaustein come here and say, you know what,
11 we here at Mount Sinai, we test every oral
12 cavity cancer for the human papilloma virus
13 today.  Of course they do because it can have an
14 affect on the treatment that is given to the
15 patient.
16     Remember, Dr. Westra said, oh, there are
17 groups, there are three or four groups around
18 the country, just North America, that are
19 looking at this very issue and they're finding
20 that there's no reason to worry about human
21 papilloma virus in the mouth.
22     Here is the first group he said that looked
23 at it, Ontario Cancer Care Ontario.  This is
24 their report.  Under the category of oral cancer
25 they said, "Insufficient data currently exists 3219
1 to assess the prognostic benefit of HPV
2 positivity in squamous cell carcinoma of the
3 larynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, sinonasal
4 tract and oral cavity."  They did not say it
5 doesn't cause it there.  What they wanted to say
6 is that there is evidence in the literature to
7 suggest that the prevalence of HPV in these
8 subsites, that includes the oral cavity, may be
9 higher than originally believed.  Their
10 meta-analyses, in other words, when they pooled
11 together a bunch of studies "in the oral cavity
12 and the larynx as high as 40 percent, 40 percent
13 of the oral cavity cancers had the human
14 papilloma virus in them."
15     Does that sound to you like there's nothing
16 to worry about, that the Ontario group found
17 there was nothing to worry about due to the
18 human papilloma virus?
19     And now the final question was, well --
20 Mr. Rosenblum addressed it, he said, well,
21 Dr. Califano said even if there was HPV, smoking
22 was the major cause of why she developed her
23 oral cavity cancer.  When you have an HPV-caused
24 cancer, tobacco doesn't further increase the
25 risk.  Smoking doesn't further increase the 3220
1 risk.
2     Who says so?  Here's the National Cancer
3 Institute.
4     "Tobacco and alcohol do not appear to
5 further increase the risk in people with oral
6 HPV infection."
7     Do not appear to increase the risk.  This is
8 not Philip Morris.  This is not Philip Morris or
9 anybody connected with Philip Morris.  This is
10 the National Cancer Institute.
11     Sorry.  You can tell I'm not used to it.  If
12 I had a board, I'd have it just right.
13     Thank you very much.
14     All right.  Where does this come from?  The
15 National Cancer Institute.  All right.
16     For Ms. Merino and her lawyers to be right
17 that smoking in her case was the legal cause of
18 why she developed her oral cavity cancer who has
19 to be wrong?
20     Dr. Saldana had to have been wrong.
21 Dr. Blaustein has to be wrong.  Dr. Felix has to
22 be wrong.  The National Cancer Institute has to
23 be wrong.  The International Agency for the
24 Research of Cancer has to be wrong.  And Johns
25 Hopkins has to be wrong.  They all have to be 3221
1 wrong.
2     Dr. Califano said flat out, Dr. Saldana was
3 wrong.  But he never saw the pathology.
4     All right.  What else was there other than
5 the fact that the fingerprint for HPV was
6 present in her tumor, in the tissue immediately
7 adjacent to her tumor?  What else was there?
8 There was Ms. Merino's age.  You remember there
9 was no dispute that if you're going to get an
10 oral cavity cancer from smoking you're going to
11 get it on average at about 65 years of age.  How
12 old was Ms. Merino?  If you go back in time you
13 know she said she had that spot in the floor of
14 her mouth for about a year, two years.  She
15 would have been 45, exactly the average age at
16 which people develop oral cavity cancer from the
17 human papilloma virus.
18     How long does it take?  Dr. Felix says, you
19 know, a minimum of 10 years on average, here you
20 are, 45 years of age.
21     In addition to that you heard that if you
22 have a smoking-related oral cavity cancer and
23 this was a stage III, stage IV, a very advanced
24 cancer because it had metastasized to a
25 lymph node, you heard that the outcomes for 3222
1 folks like that are dismal if it was caused by
2 smoking, dismal.  But if it was caused by the
3 human papilloma virus your chances of a
4 successful outcome were much, much higher.  And
5 you know that Ms. Merino survived her cancer and
6 is cancer free 19 years later, cancer free 19
7 years later.
8     So there it is, ladies and gentlemen.  There
9 is the evidence that relates, not statistically
10 to the public at large, but this is what related
11 to Ms. Merino.
12     So now let's go back to the first question
13 on the verdict form:  Was smoking cigarettes a
14 legal cause of Ms. Merino's oral cancer?
15     Miranda and I had no burden of proof here.
16 We didn't have to prove to you that her cancer
17 most probably was caused by the human papilloma
18 virus, as Dr. Saldana thought in 1996.  The
19 burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove the
20 opposite, to prove that without smoking she
21 would never have gotten her cancer.
22     And so now I ask you, in light of all of
23 this, in light of everything I just showed
24 you -- you know, I didn't make any of this up,
25 Philip Morris didn't generate any of this -- did 3223
1 they actually prove to your satisfaction, and I
2 mean each and every one of you, that
3 Ms. Merino's cancer would not have occurred had
4 it not been for -- had she never smoked?  Did
5 they really prove that to you?
6     Well, if the answer to that question is no,
7 then that's your first stop sign in this case,
8 first stop sign.  And you don't go any further,
9 as Mr. Rosenblum said.  You don't go any
10 further.
11     Now, the judge has got lots more questions
12 so I'm going to go through the rest of the
13 questions in the verdict form.
14     The second question, also a question about
15 class membership, is whether or not Ms. Merino
16 was addicted to the American cigarettes
17 containing nicotine and, frankly, although on
18 the verdict form you're going to see it as one
19 sentence it's actually two questions, was she
20 addicted and whether or not the addiction was a
21 legal cause of her oral cancer.  And, yes, it's
22 true that we each brought an expert here and it
23 is true that lots of family members and a friend
24 of Ms. Merino, including Ms. Merino, came and
25 said she was addicted.  But this isn't -- I 3224
1 think Mr. Rosenblum said, you know, you could go
2 to a cafe or a bar or something like that, you
3 can ask your friends, what do you think?  Are
4 you addicted?  And it is true that Judge Cueto
5 is not going to give you an instruction as to
6 what's the definition or what's the test.  That
7 is up to you.  But this is a court of law.  And
8 does it seem -- it must seem appropriate to the
9 lawyers here anyway that we bring in experts to
10 address the subject and that they apply a
11 serious standard in making that determination,
12 because they did it, we did it.
13     They brought in Dr. Drobes.  Dr. Drobes is a
14 guy who has done -- I'm not going to take
15 anything away from any of these people.
16 Dr. Drobes is a guy who has done a lot of
17 research on nicotine, no debate about that.  But
18 what he isn't is a licensed physician and he's
19 not somebody who's even licensed to do clinical
20 work here in the state of Florida as a
21 psychologist.
22     Miranda and I brought you Dr. Eric Kaplan.
23 Dr. Kaplan is a board-certified psychiatrist.
24 He's from up in Tampa.  Yeah, I met him on an
25 airplane.  Is there something wrong with that? 3225
1 I don't think so.
2     But he came here and he explained to you
3 exactly what is the gold standard for
4 determining whether someone really is medically
5 addicted.  And he explained to you that he went
6 through that same process.  And in going through
7 it his determination was that Ms. Merino did not
8 qualify as having been medically addicted.  And
9 he walked you through that process.
10     Now, he was asked a great question, whether
11 or not there is an objective test in determining
12 whether or not someone is or is not addicted to
13 nicotine.  And of course there's not -- there's
14 not a urine test, there's not a blood test,
15 there's not a brain chemistry test, there's not
16 a CT scan, there's not an x-ray that can be done
17 that will determine whether or not you as a
18 smoker, whether you smoke two cigarettes a day,
19 20 cigarettes a day, 40 cigarettes a day,
20 whether you're addicted or not.  There is none.
21     So if by objective that's the question, then
22 the answer is, of course, no.
23     What Dr. Kaplan was attempting to
24 communicate was simply that there's some
25 objectivity in the sense that there's a standard 3226
1 that we apply, and it comes from the American
2 Psychiatric Association.  And he applies it in
3 this case based on the facts that are given to
4 him by Ms. Merino at the time he interviewed her
5 plus what he read through the depositions,
6 et cetera.
7     You guys will have to decide for yourselves
8 what's the standard to apply and whether or not
9 she meets that standard, she met that standard.
10     But that's not the only question that's
11 being asked here.
12     The other question that's being asked is
13 whether or not if she was addicted her addiction
14 was a legal cause of her oral cancer.
15     What does that require?  Because again you
16 see this phrase "legal cause."  And what that
17 requires in this case is that her -- and, again,
18 it's this operative language right down here,
19 but for the addiction to cigarettes containing
20 nicotine, the oral cancer would not have
21 occurred.  That's what they have to prove.  They
22 have the burden of proving that but for
23 addiction to cigarettes that Ms. Merino would
24 not have developed oral cancer, period.
25     You know, you saw a long list of reasons why 3227
1 Ms. Merino smoked.  These are the things that
2 she told Dr. Kaplan and which were readily
3 apparent from the depositions that were taken.
4 And even from a question or two that I asked
5 Ms. Merino when she was on the stand.  These are
6 all the reasons, circumstances in which she
7 enjoyed smoking.
8     So what they have to prove to you is that
9 she was an involuntary smoker.  Ms. Merino is
10 somebody who, by her own admission, until the
11 night of her surgery, night before her surgery
12 never tried to quit smoking except on one
13 occasion, right?  There were times when she
14 reduced her smoking by a cigarette for an hour
15 or two, but somebody who never tried to quit
16 smoking except on one occasion when she -- her
17 mother was having surgery, she was going to --
18 she made a promise to God that she wouldn't
19 smoke for good?  No, not for good.  You heard
20 that her promise was, I'll quit smoking for 30
21 days.  It's like Lent.  It's like a New Year's
22 resolution.  I won't do it for 30 days.  What
23 are you giving up?  It's a sacrifice.  You're
24 giving up something you don't ever want to do
25 again.  Or if your plan is to go back to it at 3228
1 the end of 30 days, if you're giving up
2 something, it's a sacrifice that you plan on
3 going back to at the end of 30 days.  And the
4 answer was she was going back to it at the end
5 of 30 days.
6     To tell if somebody is really serious about
7 quitting smoking, did Mrs. Merino ever look into
8 a smoking-cessation program?  Did she ever quit
9 for a whole day aside from that one occasion?
10 Did she seek any assistance from anybody else in
11 attempting to quit smoking?  Doctor, anybody?
12 No.
13     They pointed out the fact that she continued
14 to smoke after she was diagnosed with her
15 cancer.  Well, I talked to her about that, and
16 here's the exact testimony, question and answer.
17 When it says trial transcript right down here,
18 that means this is exactly what Tracey put down
19 during the course of the trial of the case.
20 Every word that I say she types down, she takes
21 down, including when I go da, da, like that.  I
22 don't know how she types that up, but she gets
23 it down.  And then they type it into a booklet
24 form and we have it.  So we know exactly what
25 she said. 3229
1     What I said to her was, in that time frame,
2 that month and a half between when you were
3 diagnosed and when you had your surgery, "there
4 were a lot of things going on in your life
5 between the date of your diagnosis and the date
6 of the surgery, weren't there?
7     "Correct.
8     "Including an illness of your father.
9     "Correct.
10     "It was a very stressful time for you.
11     "Correct.
12     "And you used cigarettes to help you deal
13 with stress.
14     "Correct."
15     That is very common, ladies and gentlemen.
16     Her dad was sick.  She had been diagnosed
17 with oral cavity cancer.  Of course it was a
18 very stressful time.  Was she smoking
19 involuntarily, or was she smoking because she
20 was using cigarettes to help her deal with
21 stress?  That's what that boils down to.
22     Did she stop?  Yes.  They say that there was
23 a tearful, tearful time, but did she stop
24 smoking at midnight?  She stopped smoking at
25 midnight. 3230
1     They say that an addiction is -- nicotine
2 addiction is a relapsing disease, relapsing.
3 Now, I grant, there's no quibble on my part that
4 for the weeks, I don't know how many weeks after
5 her surgery Ms. Merino was physically incapable
6 of smoking and because of her discomfort, pain
7 from the surgery, I'm sure that that masked
8 whatever withdrawal symptoms, if she had any,
9 she had.  I'm not going to debate that.
10     But there came a time, and we're now 19
11 years later, has Ms. Merino ever relapsed?  Has
12 she ever even had a desire for another
13 cigarette?
14     "You've not smoked since?
15     "No.
16     "In fact, you haven't had a desire to smoke
17 since your surgery, have you?
18     "No."
19     No.  So all right.  Here we're back to this
20 question.  You have to decide whether she was
21 addicted and you also have to decide that if she
22 was addicted was her addiction so strong that it
23 made her an involuntary smoker and that it
24 caused her to get her oral cavity cancer.  And
25 that burden of proof is on Ms. Merino and her 3231
1 lawyers.
2     Involuntary smoking.  Dr. Drobes indicated
3 that even addicted smokers can quit.  Dr. Kaplan
4 indicated even addicted smokers can quit.  Why
5 is that important?  Because it just goes to show
6 that involuntary smoking but for addiction would
7 Mrs. Merino actually developed her oral cavity
8 cancer, or if she had been sufficiently
9 motivated at some point in time could she have
10 stopped if, in fact, her cancer was caused by
11 smoking?
12     I don't think you get to this question
13 because I think the first question is obvious.
14 Proof of the first question is obvious.  But if
15 you get here you have to ask yourself, have we
16 unanimously determined that the answer to this
17 question is yes?  And if you haven't been
18 satisfied then this is a second stop sign for
19 you and the answer is no and you don't go on.
20     The third question is:  Was smoking
21 cigarettes manufactured by defendant
22 Philip Morris USA a legal cause of Ms. Merino's
23 oral cancer?
24     Now, did anyone come here and say smoking
25 Philip Morris manufactured cigarettes was -- 3232
1 again, here's that legal cause requirement.
2     You know what, I don't have that slide, but
3 let me tell you it's going to have that very
4 same requirement, that but for smoking
5 Philip Morris manufactured cigarettes she
6 wouldn't have gotten her oral cancer.  So to
7 even get here you have to have decided that
8 smoking actually caused her oral cancer, which I
9 don't think the evidence supports.
10     But now, did anybody come here and say that
11 smoking Philip Morris manufactured cigarettes
12 caused her oral cavity cancer?  You know, this
13 smoking history is an interesting thing.  Yes,
14 Ms. Merino maintains that while she was living
15 in Colombia she smoked nothing but Marlboro
16 starting at age 16.  She contends that she
17 continued to smoke Marlboros throughout her
18 remaining years living in Colombia until 1974.
19 Now, we've put in evidence documents indicating
20 that that would have been very unusual, that, in
21 fact, American cigarettes comprise something
22 less than 3 percent of the total market in
23 Colombia.  There's no debate about that.  But
24 assuming that she did smoke Philip Morris
25 cigarettes, Marlboros, for what period of time 3233
1 did she smoke them?  Was it from '64 to 1982?
2 Why did she struggle -- we know that by her own
3 testimony from 1982 to 1992, 10 years, she
4 smoked Vantage cigarettes manufactured by
5 RJ Reynolds, they're not here.  We know that the
6 first cigarettes that she smoked were
7 Lucky Strikes, Camels and that sort of thing,
8 not made by Philip Morris.  They're not here.
9     We know that when it came time for her to
10 talk about what brands of cigarettes she smoked
11 after Vantage, way back in 19 -- I'm sorry, way
12 back in 2008, what she wrote down in answering
13 this interrogatory that said, what brands did
14 you smoke, she said she smoked two packs a day
15 of Dorals from 1993 to 1996.
16     "I believe I smoked one and a half to two
17 packs of Montclairs from '92 to '93.  I smoked
18 one and a half packs of Marlboros from '64 to
19 '82.  I smoked about two packs of Vantages from
20 '82 to '92."
21     She's 14 years old, she's smoking four to
22 five cigarettes of these brands not made by
23 Philip Morris.  And then she smoked Meridian, 8
24 to 15 per day approximately '94 to '95,
25 Montegos -- Meridans and Montegos are not made 3234
1 by Philip Morris -- 10 to 15 per day.
2     Finally we get to Marlboro Lights, 10 to 15
3 per day, and Virginia Slims, 5 to 10 per day
4 during the early '90s.  That was it.  That's
5 what she said in 2008, seven years ago.
6     But today when Liggett isn't here, Reynolds
7 isn't here, now it's, I smoked mostly Marlboro
8 Lights after Vantage, right?  Now.  Seven years
9 ago that wasn't the story.
10     Dr. Califano, when he was asked about
11 calculating what cigarettes caused her cancer,
12 the next question that was asked right after the
13 one that Mr. Alvarez showed you says, "Now, does
14 that mean that whatever smoking she had after
15 that time is irrelevant?
16     "No.  So we know that, you know, the risk of
17 getting oral cavity cancer is related to
18 smoking, the smoking is cumulative so it's
19 like -- trying to think of a good analogy.  It's
20 like eating a whole cheese pizza and getting
21 sick from eating the whole cheese pizza.  It
22 wasn't the last slice that made you sick.  It
23 was eating the whole cheese pizza.  So it's not
24 the first slice, the last slice, middle slice;
25 it's the totality of the exposure..." 3235
1     So what you haven't been told yet is they
2 have to have proved to you that had -- this is
3 again legal cause.  Was smoking Philip Morris
4 manufactured cigarettes a legal cause of why she
5 developed oral cavity cancer?  And you're going
6 to get that same instruction that says they have
7 to have proved to your satisfaction that but for
8 smoking Philip Morris manufactured cigarettes
9 she wouldn't have gotten her oral cavity cancer.
10 If she had never smoked Philip Morris
11 manufactured cigarettes, did they prove to you
12 that she wouldn't have gotten oral cavity
13 cancer?  And that goes way back to assuming that
14 they proved to your satisfaction that it wasn't
15 human papilloma virus that most probably caused
16 her to get her oral cavity cancer.
17     And I asked Dr. Califano this:  "You didn't
18 pay any attention to the brands that she was
19 smoking or when she smoked any particular brand
20 and that sort of thing?
21     "That's correct."
22     That's right.
23     So here's the next opportunity for a stop
24 sign.  If you don't universally, unanimously
25 conclude that they've established that it was 3236
1 smoking Philip Morris manufactured cigarettes
2 that was a but for reason why she developed oral
3 cavity cancer you have a stop sign.
4     The next questions are really complicated
5 legal language.
6     Mr. Alvarez read it to you.  I hate to read
7 this to you because it's so complicated, but it
8 says, "Did Carmenza Merino reasonably rely to
9 her detriment..."
10     So here's the first language that you have
11 to focus on.  Did she rely to her detriment?
12 Well, what's rely?  You got to hear it, you got
13 to see it and then you've got to believe it and
14 you have to act on it.  That's everything.  See
15 it, hear it, rely on it.
16     And then to her detriment means it has to
17 have had an impact on you getting cancer.
18     "...on Philip Morris USA's concealment or
19 omission of material facts concerning the health
20 effects or addictive nature of smoking
21 cigarettes that would have been necessary to
22 make statements by Philip Morris Incorporated
23 not misleading, and, if so, was such reliance a
24 legal cause of her oral cancer?"
25     Again, you have that same requirement that 3237
1 they establish that first she has to see it or
2 hear it.  Then she has to act on it.  She has to
3 rely on it.  And then it has to have been so
4 important that but for having seen it or heard
5 it and relied on it she wouldn't have gotten
6 oral cavity cancer.
7     And the same holds true for the second
8 question.  "Did Ms. Merino reasonably rely to
9 her detriment on the concealment or omission of
10 material facts concerning the health effects or
11 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes that
12 would have been necessary to make statements
13 made in furtherance of defendant Philip Morris'
14 agreement to conceal, not misleading, and, if
15 so, was such reliance a legal cause of her oral
16 cancer?"
17     Same thing.  These are -- these aren't did
18 Philip Morris fail to say a number of things.
19 That's not what this question asks.  This
20 question asks:  Did Mrs. Merino -- did
21 Ms. Merino hear something, see something, then
22 rely on it?  How can she rely on it?  Well, it
23 has to cause her to begin smoking, to continue
24 smoking, to continue smoke -- I'm sorry, to
25 become a regular smoker, to continue smoking and 3238
1 not stop, not stop.  Did they show you any
2 testimony by Ms. Merino that said any of that?
3 No.  None.
4     In fact, this is a little diagram, a little
5 diagram that I've created to help you understand
6 the concept of legal cause.  For something to be
7 a legal cause it has to have a direct connection
8 to Ms. Merino.  She has to have seen it.  She
9 has to have heard it.  She has to have read it.
10     MR. ALVAREZ:  Objection, Judge, that's
11 improper.
12     THE COURT:  Overruled.
13     MR. REILLY:  It has to have had a
14 substantial impact on her.  How substantial?
15 That but for whatever it is she would have done
16 the opposite.
17     That is what's necessary in order to be a
18 legal cause.
19     Now, both during this trial -- well, here's
20 an instruction that Judge Cueto is going to give
21 you.  "Manufacturing, selling and advertising
22 cigarettes are lawful activities.  Therefore, I
23 instruct you that the defendant," Philip Morris,
24 "cannot be held liable simply for manufacturing,
25 selling or advertising cigarettes." 3239
          Ms. Merino was in Colombia for -- until
      1974.  Was there any evidence on the part of
      Ms. Merino that she saw, heard, read any of the
      things that they complain about?  No.  As a
      matter of fact.  Here's another instruction that
      Judge Cueto read to you several times during the
      course of the trial, but he's going to read it
      to you again later today.  It says, "You heard
      evidence about the defendant's historical
      conduct that occurred in the United States prior
      to Ms. Merino moving to the United States in
      1974.  There is no allegation that Ms. Merino
      ever saw, heard, read or relied on any of these
      statements or advertisements or evidence when
      making decisions whether to smoke or refrain
      from smoking."
          My goodness, it can't be more direct than
      that, can it?  And that's an instruction from
      Judge Cueto.
          MR. ALVAREZ:  You know what, Judge, can we
      approach?
          THE COURT:  Sure.
          (The following discussion was held at
sidebar:)
          THE COURT:  What's the objection? 3240
          MR. ALVAREZ:  He didn't read the
      instruction.  That's not what the instruction
      says.  He only read half the instruction.
          THE COURT:  You'll get up and have a
      rebuttal.
          MR. ALVAREZ:  No, I understand, but he's
      saying that this is what you're going to tell
      them.  And if he's going to do an instruction
      he's got to do the instruction appropriately.
      You can't leave things out.  It has to do with
      the Engle findings, okay.  That's the big
      difference.  It has to do with the Engle
      findings related to conduct.
          He didn't read that part.
          THE COURT:  Okay.  You can get up and read
      it in rebuttal.
          MR. ALVAREZ:  I'm objecting to it because
      it's inappropriate.
          THE COURT:  Thank you.  Go ahead.
          (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
following proceedings were held in open court:)
          THE COURT:  Yes?  Okay.  We need a bathroom
      break.  Let's do a bathroom break.  I'm out of a
      bailiff and I'm out of -- I'll tell you what,
      you want me to walk you over.  You can walk over 3241
      there.  Just leave your notes over there.  When
      you're done, just walk knock on the door.
          (Jury exited the courtroom at 2:34 p.m.)
          THE COURT:  You've used about 55 minutes.
          MR. ALVAREZ:  What did you say?
          THE COURT:  Mr. Reilly has used 55 minutes.
          MR. ALVAREZ:  I've got 57 minutes and 16
      seconds, but who's counting.
          THE COURT:  Give me a break.
          MR. ALVAREZ:  I'm just messing with you.  55
      minutes is fine.
          (A recess was taken from 2:36 p.m. to
2:41 p.m.)
          (Jury entered the courtroom at 2:42 p.m.)
          THE COURT:  You know, in Europe instead of
      gavels, how they use gavels here, they use
      bells.  So if you're out of order, they're going
      bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
          Let's take a seat.  Everybody better?
          Mr. Reilly.
          MR. REILLY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
          You know what, it's been suggested that I
      show you the whole -- may I have my screen back?
          VIDEO TECH:  You may.
          MR. REILLY:  This is exactly what this 3242
      instruction is going to say in its entirety.  It
      says, "Engle findings related only to conduct in
      USA beginning in 1974.  The Engle findings in
      this particular case pertain only to
      Philip Morris and other tobacco companies' and
      industry organizations' conduct in the United
      States when Ms. Merino arrived from 1974 to
      1996."
          And then it goes on to say exactly what I
      just showed you.
          So you can see the whole thing.  There you
      go.  Doesn't alter the fact that there's no
      allegation that Ms. Merino ever saw, heard, read
      or relied on any of these statements or
      advertisements or evidence when making decisions
      whether to smoke or refrain from smoking.
          But we go on because Ms. Merino finally
      arrives here in the United States in 1974,
      right?  So in the trial transcript she was
      asked:  "Well, how did that affect you -- this
      is a question that Mr. Alvarez asked Ms. Merino.
      He said, "Well -- after he asked her whether or
      not she saw or heard anything sometime in the
      '80s, "Well, how did that affect you when you
      heard these tobacco companies say that smoking 3243
1       hasn't been proven?  How did that affect you?"
2           Because you see he only went so far in what
3       he showed you up on the screen in her trial
4       testimony.
5           She said, "No, I just continued smoking."
6           And then he said, and this is -- ladies and
7       gentlemen, this is key, this is absolutely key
8       to this legal cause question.  "Did those
9       statements have an impact on you?
10           "No."
11           That wasn't a question posed by me.  That
12       was a question posed by Mr. Alvarez of his own
13       client.  And that takes me back to she has to
14       have relied to her detriment and that has to be
15       a legal cause of her getting oral cancer.
16           And yet here was her specific answer to the
17       question posed by Mr. Alvarez.  "Did those
18       statements have an impact on you?
19           "No."
20           Period.  That's it.
21           And there's the trial transcript page right
22       there (indicating).
23           Matter of fact, I asked her, "You don't
24       recall any message that you heard or read from
25       any cigarette company on the issue of health, 3244
      correct?
          "Correct."
          I asked her, "You've never heard of the
      Tobacco Industry Research Committee.
          "No.
          "Or the Council for Tobacco Research.
          "I don't recall.
          "Or the Tobacco Institute.
          "If it was after my surgery, no, I don't
      recall.
          "No, I'm talking about at any time.
          "I don't recall."
          In light of the requirement that there be
      reliance and it be a legal cause of her oral
      cancer, in light of those answers, especially
      the one she gave to her own lawyer, the answer
      has to be no.  And those are two more stop signs
      on those specific questions.
          When she comes to the United States, you
      know, they showed you, and continued to show you
      here in their closing argument, lots of
      advertisements and statements by other cigarette
      companies before Ms. -- and other folks,
      documents before Ms. Merino even gets here.  And
      yet there's already that instruction from Judge 3245
      Cueto.  There's no reliance.
          So why do they continue to show you that?
      During the course of this trial Judge Cueto gave
      you that instruction I think three times.  Why
      do they continue to show you that when you know
      it didn't impact Ms. Merino?
          MR. ALVAREZ:  Objection, Judge, attacking
      the way we're presenting the case.
          THE COURT:  Sustained.
          MR. REILLY:  Well, it's only to make you
      unhappy.
          MR. ALVAREZ:  Objection, Judge.
          THE COURT:  Overruled.
          MR. REILLY:  Let me walk you quickly through
      this timeline.  I'm not going to take near the
      time that I did my opening statement because
      you've now seen the evidence in this case.  You
      know that Ms. Merino was born into a very
      well-educated family.  You know that her father
      was -- I think -- what did she call herself?
      Upper class.  And you know that her father was
      college educated, accountant for a university.
      You know from the presentation that was just
      made -- I needed your cue.
          You know from the presentation that was just 3246
      made by Miranda that she put in -- we put in
      evidence, I don't know -- how many exhibits did
      we put in evidence?
          MS. SOTO:  In the box?
          MR. REILLY:  Yeah.
          MS. SOTO:  Over a hundred.
          MR. REILLY:  We gave you over a hundred
      examples of Spanish language -- by the way, you
      notice that everything they showed you was all
      in English.  Everything they showed you was all
      in English.  Does Ms. Merino speak English?  No.
      Did Ms. Merino see the movies or the deposition
      transcripts?  Did she see any of that during her
      lifetime?  No, none of it.
          If even those ads had played, and they
      didn't even show you the dates of the ads, they
      didn't even show you ads with the warnings on
      them that were present when she got here.  They
      didn't show you a single ad from Colombia, not
      one, except for what they call a tombstone that
      somebody gave to a grade school for how to pay
      for your yearbook.  And was there any evidence
      that Ms. Merino saw that?  Zero.  Zero.
          So what we put in evidence was information
      to show you the -- they didn't talk about 3247
      Dr. Proctor, the very first witness, you know, a
      long time ago, Dr. Proctor who didn't know
      anything about Ms. Merino, he didn't know
      anything about Colombia, nothing at all.  And
      yet he spent a whole day and a half talking
      about events that the Court has just instructed
      you have no play in this case.
          What we put in evidence just a little while
      ago is examples --
          MR. ALVAREZ:  Excuse me, that's not what the
      instruction said, Judge.  Objection.
          THE COURT:  What the instruction said -- I'm
      sorry, come sidebar because I'm not quite sure
      what you're referring.
          (The following discussion was held at
sidebar:)
          THE COURT:  So your statement was they spent
      a lot of time showing you stuff that --
          MR. REILLY:  Was covered by your
      instruction.
          THE COURT:  And your objection is?
          MR. ROSENBLUM:  The instruction says that
      there's a purpose for which this evidence is
      being introduced, and Mr. Reilly was suggesting
      with his comments that the evidence that's being 3248
1       introduced has no purpose.  And when he said
2       before when you sustained the objection, the
3       only reason we introduced it was to somehow to
4       anger them or inflame them, when you have told
5       them that there's a proper admissible purpose
6       for which it's being offered.  So it's improper
7       for Mr. Reilly to say that it has nothing to do
8       with this case.
9           THE COURT:  I don't know if you want to
10       complete that or I'm going to sustain the
11       objection.  Although it's really moot right now
12       because he already finished.  Or you can bring
13       it up on your rebuttal.  Because I don't know
14       that there's anything I can do at this point.
15           MR. ROSENBLUM:  So we move to strike it as
16       being improper.
17           THE COURT:  What is it that you want me
18       to --
19           MR. ROSENBLUM:  The last comment that
20       Mr. Reilly made that -- I can paraphrase.
21           MR. REILLY:  I'll take care of it.
22           THE COURT:  You'll take care it of?
23           MR. REILLY:  I'd like some more time,
24       though, Judge.
25           THE COURT:  Yeah. 3249
          (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
following proceedings were held in open court:)
          THE COURT:  Couple of minutes.
          MR. REILLY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
          Here's the instruction -- an instruction
      that the Judge is going to give you in
      connection with why that evidence came in.  Such
      evidence, everything that happened in Colombia
      before 1974 when she arrives here, is only being
      introduced to show the culture of American
      cigarette smoking as it existed and developed
      before Ms. Merino even came to the United
      States.  That's the sole reason why it came in
      evidence in this case, the sole reason.
          Thanks for asking me to do that.
          MR. ALVAREZ:  You're welcome.
          MR. REILLY:  Why did we put all these
      documents in?  We put them in just to show you
      Colombia wasn't some backwater that didn't
      receive the information about the health risks
      of smoking, the science that was advancing in
      connection with the health risks of smoking.  It
      wasn't like the people in Colombia were not
      being presented with an opportunity to see it,
      read it and make decisions about it, make 3250
      decisions about whether they would or they
      wouldn't smoke.
          We showed you examples of articles that
      appeared in Colombian media, and not just any
      Colombian media.  Because this was not about --
      we didn't present this in a way that this was
      about the Colombian public.  We chose
      publications that Ms. Merino told you under oath
      in this courtroom were taken in her house,
      either here in the United States or in Colombia.
      Those are the only ones we took these articles
      out of.
          She began smoking cigarettes made by
      somebody else in 1962.
          In 1964 she began working for Avianca
      Airlines.  Was Ms. Merino a smart person?  Yes.
      Did she leave school because she couldn't manage
      it?  No, absolutely not.  Absolutely not.
      Within a short period of time she becomes the
      manager of the national department of Avianca
      Airlines.  She's not even 19 years old yet.  Is
      Ms. Merino a smart person?  Absolutely.
      Absolutely.
          You saw just today, you saw the first
      scientific roundtable about cigarettes on 3251
      Colombian television.  All of this was in
      Spanish.  You have the articles.  If you want to
      read them, if you want to take the time to go
      through them and see them, they're there for
      your review.
          Did they put in evidence one single article,
      once Mrs. Merino finally gets here in 1974,
      after she's now 25, 26 years old, did they put
      in evidence a single article in Spanish that had
      any misinformation in it from any cigarette
      company, just one?  None.  Everything they
      showed you was in English, wasn't it?  Every
      television program, every everything was in
      English.
          Ms. Merino made it quite plain she didn't
      watch American television, English television.
      When she watched TV here in this country it was
      in Spanish Univision, because she speaks
      Spanish, she doesn't speak English.
          Early '70s while she's still living in
      Colombia she works for two different travel
      agencies.  Again, she has a major role.  She's
      managing the national department for both of
      those companies.  You know that in 1971
      cigarette ads in Colombia were moved to 9:30 at 3252
      night.  That's the same year that cigarette
      advertising on television in the United States
      ends.  That's what, three years before
      Ms. Merino even gets here.
          1974, remember I asked Ms. Merino if she saw
      the warnings go on the packs of cigarettes in
      Colombia before she ever came to the United
      States, ever came here.  And her answer was,
      yeah, I saw them.
          "Did you observe that there was a warning on
      every pack of cigarettes that was sold in
      Colombia?
          "Yes.
          "And you knew that warning said that smoking
      was bad or dangerous for your health, right?"
          And her answer was "Yes."
          "Why did you not think about quitting
      smoking -- this is a question that was asked by
      her counsel, as I recall -- "when you first
      encountered the health warning labels on
      cigarettes in Colombia?
          "Because I was already addicted and I really
      did not pay very much attention to it."
          I did not pay very much attention to it.
          When she lands here, what's the situation? 3253
      They said they wanted to set the stage.  Well,
      let's set the stage for what life is like here
      in the United States regarding smoking when the
      plane lands in 1974.  There's a warning on every
      pack.  What's it say?  Warning:  Surgeon General
      has determined that cigarette smoking is
      dangerous for your health.
          Did Ms. Merino see it?  Yes.  When I asked
      her about it, because remember the ads, if an ad
      was in Spanish, the warning was in Spanish.
      There's no more advertising on television when
      the plane lands.  Hasn't been for two years here
      in the United States.
          She said, I remember the warning but I just
      don't remember the part about the Surgeon
      General.  Okay.  Fine.
          Did you pay any attention to it?
          No.  No.
          That's all right.  You know, you get to
      decide whether you're going to pay attention to
      it or not.
          We showed you articles from here in the
      United States from the Miami Herald in Spanish,
      El Miami Herald, so that you would understand
      that the same kind of articles that were 3254
      appearing in the English language newspaper, the
      Miami Herald, were appearing in the El Miami
      Herald.
          She switched to Vantage in either the late
      '70s or maybe 1982.
          You remember that Ms. Merino's husband was
      telling her, you need to cut back, you need to
      cut down because you're going to hurt your
      lungs.  You're going to make yourself sick.  And
      what did Ms. Merino say about that?
          "Your husband told you you were smoking too
      much?
          "Yes.
          "And he told you frequently to reduce your
      smoking.
          "Yes.
          "You ignored your husband when he spoke to
      you.
          "Yes."
          Yes.  But today she'd like 16 million
      dollars.
          1985 the warnings change.  Now they
      explicitly say smoking causes lung cancer and
      other illnesses.  If you quit smoking it greatly
      reduces your health risk.  In Spanish when the 3255
      ad is in Spanish.
          Did they show you one Spanish ad?
      Ms. Merino said, I switched to Marlboro Lights.
      I showed her ads for lights.  She said, I never
      saw those ads.
          Those ads were in Spanish.
          Remember 1985 was about the same time that
      Dr. Felix said the human papilloma virus -- and
      you saw, 1983, human papilloma virus, koilocytes
      recognized as pathognomonic for the human
      papilloma virus.
          "In the mid 1980s you saw the new warnings
      that went on the packs of cigarettes.
          "I don't recall very well, but, yes, I could
      have seen them, but I don't recall them.
          "You ignored those warnings as well.
          "Correct.  Yes."
          '90s her husband continues to tell her to
      reduce her smoking.  That's when she discovered
      the cold sore.
          1994 was the congressional testimony that
      Mr. Alvarez just showed you.  Is that in
      Spanish?  Was that on Univision?  That was on
      C-Span.  Remember I asked Dr. Proctor, was that
      ever shown in Spanish? 3256
          He said, not that I know of.  Not that I
      know of.
          If Ms. Merino somehow was watching C-Span,
      an all English-language news broadcast, and if
      she had seen them say anything she wouldn't have
      understood a word they said.
          So the next question asks you to assign the
      percentage of any fault that was a legal cause,
      a legal cause of Ms. Merino's oral cancer that
      you charge to Philip Morris and Ms. Merino.  In
      light of all that story, where there's really no
      connection between Ms. Merino except she bought,
      she liked for a period of time, from 1964,
      according to her, until 1982, or thereabouts,
      she smoked Philip Morris manufactured
      cigarettes, which the judge has just informed
      you to advertise them, to make them and to sell
      them is legal and not actionable, what
      percentage of fault do you assign to
      Philip Morris in this case, in light of
      Ms. Merino and all the decisions that she made?
          Mr. Alvarez said, hey, Philip Morris
      continued to make cigarettes with nicotine.
      Yeah, of course.  That's like saying Bacardi
      continues to make alcohol -- rum with alcohol. 3257
      That's what cigarettes are.  That's what they've
      always been.  And that's what smokers go to the
      store to buy.
          And you heard the story of Philip Morris
      making cigarettes with no nicotine in them, none
      at all.  And you heard what happened.  Not only
      did nobody buy them, but the Federal Trade
      Commission came down and said, take them off the
      market.  Those public health organizations said,
      those are the most dangerous cigarettes ever
      made.  You need to take them off the market.
      And yet here they are criticizing Philip Morris
      for having made the cigarettes that people do
      want to buy.  And as far as was it some secret
      that there was nicotine in the cigarettes?
      None.  It's right on the pack what the
      percentage of nicotine is.  Did Ms. Merino say,
      I didn't know that there was nicotine in tobacco
      or in cigarettes that I smoked?  No way.
          Ms. Merino said that before she ever came to
      the United States she was calling her smoking an
      addiction, before she ever came to the United
      States.
          When you consider this question, you've got
      to consider this admission in this case, the 3258
      plaintiff, Ms. Merino, has acknowledged that her
      acts or omissions relating to the frequency and
      duration of her efforts to quit smoking were,
      she says, a partial proximate cause of her oral
      cancer.  She goes on to contend that that's in
      combination with the acts of Philip Morris.  And
      the judge is instructing you that you have to
      assign a percentage of fault to Ms. Merino.
          Well, I leave this -- first of all, I don't
      think you ever get here, especially in light of
      the very first question on this verdict form.
      But if you do you have to assign a percentage of
      fault under these circumstances, where
      Ms. Merino is a -- by her recollection, she's an
      11-year smoker, almost a 12-year smoker before
      she ever even gets to the United States.
          What percentage of fault do you assign to
      somebody who does all the things that I've just
      gone through?  Mr. Alvarez says, oh, you would
      only give that person 10 percent.  I can't help
      but think that if you even get this far those
      numbers have got to be flipped, would have to be
      under these circumstances.  And we're not here
      about the public in general.  We're only here
      about one person. 3259
          And here was the testimony of her brother.
      I asked him -- or I'm sorry, Miranda asked him,
      "Is there some reason why you chose not to ever
      discuss the topic of smoking with your sister?"
          And he said, "Well, when the ads," these are
      the anti-smoking ads, "started to come out, my
      mom, my dad and Carmenza smoked, you know.  The
      ads that were coming out about the dangers, and
      they were running the risk themselves, they were
      assuming it.  Because when you attack a theme or
      problem somebody has, it could be
      counterproductive."
          That's what her own brother had to say.
          Here's another instruction you're going to
      get from Judge Cueto.  This is about
      advertising.  You've seen ads.  You just saw
      some of them a little bit ago.  You've heard
      evidence regarding advertisements for cigarettes
      in the United States by tobacco companies other
      than Philip Morris USA.  "Plaintiff claims that
      such advertising was part of a conspiracy to
      conceal information about the health effects and
      addictive nature of cigarettes only to the
      extent that the advertisements did not reveal
      the danger of smoking." 3260
          But ladies and gentlemen, every ad, every ad
      when Ms. Merino got here had the Surgeon
      General's warning on it, every one of them.
          So that brings us to this question of
      damages.  And let me start by saying, the Court
      is going to tell you there is no exact standard
      for measuring such damage.  The amount should be
      fair and just.  Again, I don't think you get
      there, but if you do, that's the judge's only
      instruction to you about that subject.
          16 million dollars?  Talk about excessive
      amounts of money, that's an excessive amount of
      money.  That is if her life expectancy is 22
      years that's almost a million dollars a year.
          There is no question -- let me go through
      the things that aren't being claimed here.
      There's no claim for medical expenses.  There's
      no claim for lost wages.  There's no claim
      for -- there's only a claim for her personal
      injury.  And, in fact, there's no claim for
      medical conditions that first arose after her
      '96 treatment for oral cancer.  No claim for
      whatever carotid artery problems she's had or
      any problems with swallowing she has or the loss
      of teeth in addition to those removed during her 3261
      surgery.  There's no claim for any of that.
          But there is no question that Ms. Merino has
      had a change in her life, a change in her
      appearance as a result of her cancer treatment.
      Fortunately she was cured.  Fortunately it was
      cured.  I mean, that's huge, right?  Fortunately
      she was cured.
          Her surgery has left scars.  There's no
      question about that.  She has difficulty
      speaking.  We all experienced that.
          It's life-altering to some degree.  She
      still goes shopping.  She still goes to
      restaurants.  She might not eat in the
      restaurant.  But she still goes on cruises and
      she still goes on vacation trips.  And she still
      goes to church.  And she still goes to social
      events.  She does all those things.  But I'm not
      debating that she's had some change in her life.
          But let's talk about life-altering sums of
      money.  You know, $100,000 changes people's
      lives.  $250,000 changes people's lives a ton.
      Half a million dollars changes people's lives
      dramatically.  16 million dollars is an
      excessive sum, if you got this far.
          When you just think about that, you know 3262
      that what I just said about those sums of money
      is true, how life changing it would be if
      somebody received a half a million dollars.  How
      life changing would that be really and truly?
          Now we come to the last question on this
      verdict form.  And it is, "Under the
      circumstances of this case, state whether you
      find by clear and convincing evidence that
      punitive damages are warranted."
          Well, there are several things you need to
      know about this.  The first one is, Mr. Alvarez
      said, oh, my goodness, this is where you're
      supposed to go.  Ladies and gentlemen, you've
      had so many stop signs before you ever even get
      to this question.  You don't even get to this
      question if you didn't answer questions 4 or 5
      yes.  Don't even get here.  Unless they've
      proved to you that she relied to her detriment,
      you don't even get here.  But Mr. Alvarez blew
      right past all that.
          Clear and convincing evidence, what's that?
      Remember during voir dire I talked to some of
      you guys about in your jobs, in your lives do
      you have to be precise and exact?  If there was
      no evidence -- and whatever it is, whatever it 3263
      is -- this is a key instruction:  "In deciding
      whether punitive damages are warranted, you may
      not seek to punish Philip Morris for any harms
      suffered by any individual other than
      Ms. Merino, nor may you punish Philip Morris for
      conduct that didn't produce harms -- that did
      not produce harms within Florida."
          THE CLERK:  Five minutes.
          MR. REILLY:  Thank you.
          "You have heard evidence regarding
      activities by Philip Morris that plaintiff
      claims encouraged youths to smoke.  You may not
      consider similar activities of other tobacco
      companies in determining whether punitive
      damages may be warranted against Philip Morris."
          There's another one, I believe, that's going
      to say -- oh.  On this youth issue.  Why do they
      keep showing you youth stuff?  When Ms. Merino
      got here, she was 25 years old, 25 years old.
      Why are they showing you Philip Morris observing
      what percentage of people under the legal age
      begin smoking when it has to relate to
      Ms. Merino and she's 25 years old the day she
      lands here?  When those documents are created
      she's like in her 30s or 40s.  It has to relate 3264
      to Ms. Merino.  And the evidence has to be clear
      and convincing.
          In contrast to their other burden of proof,
      "clear and convincing evidence is evidence that
      is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion and
      of such weight that it produces a firm belief or
      conviction, without hesitation, about the matter
      at issue."
          That clearly doesn't exist in this case.
      And you can't consider in any way when
      considering punitive damages the Engle findings.
          All right.  So what's the answer to this
      question?  The answer is no.  That's clear.
          One more thing, I didn't hear Mr. Alvarez
      talk about Dr. Farone.  Dr. Farone was the guy
      you saw on videotape who got fired from
      Philip Morris because he didn't get the
      promotion that he wanted, and that was 30
      something years ago.
          Just remember what he said when I
      cross-examined him.  He said he was proud of the
      work he did at Philip Morris, that the people in
      the R&D department of Philip Morris were
      dedicated to making a safer cigarette.  Filters,
      vent holes, porous paper, reconstituted tobacco 3265
      and expanded tobacco were all good ideas.
      Philip Morris doesn't spike cigarettes with
      nicotine; the amount of nicotine decreases
      during manufacturing.
          He said all those good things about
      Philip Morris even though he's now testified,
      what did he say, a hundred times against the
      company that fired him because he threatened to
      sue them because he didn't get the promotion
      that he wanted.
          All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, you've
      been incredibly attentive.  I greatly appreciate
      it.  I'm going to sit down now.  Oh, I have to
      say one more thing, and that is, it's true that
      if you were to answer this question yes,
      Mr. Alvarez didn't tell you, but there will be a
      whole nother session.  There will be another
      argument by counsel, there will be more
      evidence, et cetera, because you'd have to
      determine what was the amount of punitive
      damages to be awarded.
          All right.  Now, I greatly appreciate your
      attention.  You've been -- nobody fell asleep
      during my closing argument.  I greatly
      appreciate that. 3266
          They get to get back up again.  I don't know
      whether it's going to be Mr. Alvarez or
      Mr. Rosenblum, but it's going to be one of them,
      or maybe both of them, and they have another 15,
      16, 17 minutes to go.  Why?  Because they have
      the burden of proof, the burden to prove that
      everything I showed you, and I showed you
      document for document for document that
      everything I just showed you is not right.  They
      have the burden of proof to show you that what I
      just showed you is wrong.
          Thank you very much.
