15             MR. MOLONY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
16             Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  I'd like
17       to, first of all, join Mr. Patacca in thanking each and
18       every one of you for the dedication and the attention
19       that you, obviously, have provided to all of us in the
20       last two-plus weeks since we've gotten together.
21       It's -- it's been obvious to all of us how hard you've
22       tried and exerted yourself to pay attention to the
23       evidence and listen intently every step of the way,
24       which sometimes isn't -- isn't easy, particularly when
25       you have extended video testimony, as we've had in this

 1       case.
 2             And on behalf of myself, my client, Lorillard
 3       Tobacco Company, my partner, Jay Woods, and my partner,
 4       Andy Carpenter, they all join me in thanking you, as
 5       Mr. Patacca already has, for your service and your
 6       dedication to the job that you, obviously, have
 7       displayed here during the course of the last couple of
 8       weeks.
 9             I'd also like to extend my thanks to Mr. Olson for
10       probably the greatest number of having to get up and
11       flip the light on and off and Mr. Langley and Ms. Cook
12       for their dedication and assistance as well.
13             One other thing, before I get on with the real
14       task that I have here today, which is to review the
15       evidence with you, and it's something that any trial
16       lawyer's a little uncomfortable with starting out at
17       closing argument with an apology.  I'm going to do that
18       right now.  The reason I'm going to do that is I
19       misspoke. 20             When I got up here, as Mr. Patacca has pointed out
21       to you several times in his opening statement, when I --
22       excuse me, in his closing statement, in referencing my
23       opening statement, I was referencing things that had
24       been said and done in years gone by in my opening
25       statement.  And I pointed how -- out how times have

 1       changed, things like that.  For example, Santa and
 2       puppies and ads from decades and decades ago are
 3       things that no longer would be done by any of us, by
 4       you, by me, by my client and I was referencing things
 5       like that.
 6             And at the conclusion of my remarks in -- in that
 7       regard, I made a mistake.  Rather than saying what I
 8       intended to say, which was I'm not here to defend those
 9       things from so long ago, I said, I'm not here to
10       apologize.  And so you've heard that and you've seen
11       that blown up into what has been characterized as
12       another Frank Statement, if you will.
13             What the lawyers say in this proceeding, as you
14       already know, is not evidence.  What matters here and
15       what you've pledged to base your decision on in this
16       case is evidence.  And so please disregard my mistake,
17       please don't penalize my client because I misspoke more
18       than two weeks ago in that limited regard, that's
19       exactly what it was and no more.
20             So with that explanation, I'd like to leave that
21       subject and move on to the subject that really should
22       matter.  And I -- I trust, given your serious way that
23       you've approached this trial, that you share my
24       perspective that what really matters and what will
25       really matter in deciding this case are clearly two

 1       things, the issues -- well, the issues that the court
 2       frames and the -- and the evidence that we have already
 3       seen from the witness stand in one form or fashion or
 4       another.
 5             So without any further ado, let me proceed.  I
 6       have a lot of ground to cover because I'm going to go
 7       through the evidence, as I did before, I'm going to do
 8       my best not to replow old ground, but there's new stuff
 9       that we hadn't talked about in the opening statement and
10       the best way that I thought I could present it to you is
11       visually.
12             And so I have a great number of -- of slides that
13       I'd like to show you and really with an eye toward
14       foc- -- focusing in on the actual evidence, not soaring
15       oratory, the facts, the proof, what's there, what the
16       law truly requires, so that when you do retire and you
17       do reach a decision in this case, it will be based upon
18       the things that you promised and swore, both from the
19       very outset of this case, that would be the only basis
20       upon which your decisions would be based, so.
21             Now, with -- with that, I'd like to first put up a 22       slide which depicts --
23             No, let's leave the lights up, if you don't mind.
24       Thank you, Mr. Olson.
25             Okay.  What's not on the verdict form.  Let's get

 1       this out of the way right at -- at the -- at the outset.
 2       First of all, whether cigarette smoking caused Jackie
 3       Miller's lung cancer.  As I told you at the outset, we
 4       don't -- we don't dispute that at all in this
 5       proceeding.
 6             Next.  Whether she was addicted to cigarettes.
 7       Again, that's not in dispute here either.
 8             Next.  Whether cigarettes should be legal.  Now,
 9       again, what's important here is, as you -- as you
10       know -- well know, that at one point in time they were
11       illegal in Florida.  We touched upon that yesterday with
12       Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, Dr. Roberts very briefly.  And while
13       I know that some of you may wish cigarettes weren't
14       legal, part of the oath that we have given in this case
15       is that this case is not to decide that issue.  That's
16       not before us in this proceeding.
17             And I trust and I know, given how seriously
18       you've taken your task here and -- and participating as
19       jurors in this case, that you will decide it on the
20       issues that the court does frame and not the ones that
21       it does not.
22             Next.  Okay.  Now, right here at the outset, I
23       thought it important to spend a minute and summarize the
24       evidence.  There's only one dispute here that I need to
25       surface right now, in all this information that's

 1       depicted here, and I'll get to it in a minute when I get
 2       to my timeline and I walk through the facts and the
 3       testimony.
 4             There's really no dispute whatsoever in any of
 5       what is depicted here based upon the evidence, other
 6       than whether Kents begins here in 1959, which is, as
 7       you'll hear more about in a minute, which is what Carol
 8       Gibson testified to in her first deposition, or whether
 9       it should be pushed five years back earlier, which is
10       what she testified to in her second deposition.
11             That's the only -- of all this information here,
12       of all these brands and all these time frames, I submit
13       to you there's no dispute whatsoever, other than -- than
14       in that one respect with regard to the Kent brand usage.
15       And the -- the significance, or what I would suggest is
16       the significance, that would become more plain as I get
17       to that point in my presentation.
18             Now, at the outset of this proceeding, we talked
19       about -- next -- next slide, please -- control,
20       causation and responsibility.  And I presented these to
21       you as sort of a shorthand method for thinking about the
22       issue of legal cause, which we're going to be spending a
23       good bit of time on in my remarks here today, because 24       really, as I suggested to you, if you can answer the
25       first two issues here, address these first two issues,

 1       then you will know who ultimately is responsible in this
 2       proceeding and -- and that should guide your verdict.
 3             So let's go to the next slide.  Control.  Of
 4       course, the issue there is who is -- who is the person
 5       who was in control of Jackie Miller's lifestyle
 6       decisions?  We've heard an awful lot about it.  And at
 7       the outset when I did -- when I presented my opening
 8       statement, what I told you that I wanted to do and what
 9       I've done my best to do in this proceeding is to develop
10       the evidence in a way so that each of you had -- gets to
11       know her, got to know her beyond in a superficial way.
12       Because really you need to know the person and how the
13       person lived her life and how from, you know, externally
14       looking at the evidence, how she went about deciding the
15       important things that she decided in her life.
16             And to that end, we spent a great deal of time
17       looking at her and the decisions that she made and the
18       experiences that she had and why she did what she did.
19       And also we -- we spent time in this regard looking at
20       the whole issue of addiction.
21             And Mr. Patacca's right, I did not put on an
22       addiction expert.  And I did that for a very good
23       reason.  I did it because the acknowledgments from the
24       two experts who testified in his case on the subject of
25       addiction presented the proof that I needed.  And you've

 1       sat here long enough, I wasn't about to put on another
 2       one just to duplicate what had -- had already been
 3       elicited from the witness stand.
 4             So in that regard, let's go to the next slide.
 5       What do the experts say about quitting smoking?
 6       Plaintiff's experts.  They say more than that 50
 7       Ameri- -- million Americans have quit.
 8             Next.  They say that the fact someone is addicted
 9       is a barrier -- barrier to the behavioral change, but it
10       doesn't free them from responsibility for their own
11       behavior.  That's Dr. Burns.  Being addicted doesn't
12       prevent a smoker from trying to quit.  Okay.  And,
13       finally, the individual smoker must decide whether or
14       not to continue smoking.
15             None of this is exactly a great revelation.  But
16       you look at the evidence here and as we'll see again
17       here in a little bit, there is very little evidence that
18       suggests that Jackie Miller ever even tried or was
19       interested in quitting smoking, but we'll -- we'll
20       detail that more in a little bit.
21             Next slide, please.  The same experts say, even if
22       you're addicted, you can still quit smoking.  1.5
23       million smokers quit every year.  And 90 percent -- this
24       may have been -- be a surprise to some of you that
25       haven't really spent much time looking at the subject of 3992
 1       quitting smoking, but 90 percent of the people who quit
 2       smoking, quit cold turkey.
 3             And I -- I'd submit to you that's just common
 4       sense, because as you've heard in this case, what really
 5       is the key to somebody quitting is whether they're
 6       motivated to quit, whether they really want to quit,
 7       whether they persist in that motivation, whether
 8       they have in their heart of hearts a commitment to
 9       quitting.
10             And as a consequence, what could be more plain
11       than if you're going to do it cold turkey?  Most likely
12       you've made that decision and you have more of a
13       commitment than otherwise.
14             As the evidence indicates here, most of the
15       nicotine is gone from your body within 24 hours of
16       smoking the last cigarette.
17             And, finally, any withdrawal effect from nicotine
18       is gone in 10 to 14 days.
19             So all of the -- all of that evidence is -- is
20       pertinent to your evaluation and ultimate decision as to
21       who is in control first and foremost of Jackie Miller's
22       smoking.  And -- and who -- therefore, ultimately,
23       that's part of the responsibility question.
24             Next slide.  The -- the evidence here, I think,
25       plainly rec- -- reflects that Jackie Miller enjoyed

 1       smoking cigarettes.
 2             Let me stop on that for a minute.  I have to tell
 3       you that I've never seen so many photographs introduced
 4       in a trial in my -- my life.  And what's interesting to
 5       me about them, particularly in this context, is how of
 6       all those photographs, as I look at them, there's only
 7       one, and you'll see them and be able to take them back
 8       with you into the jury room, there's only one -- all of
 9       them depict Ms. Miller smoking, almost every one and
10       every one is pretty much in a social setting, whether it
11       be with friends or family and everyone, she seems
12       immensely -- to be immensely enjoying herself, which is
13       wonderful.
14             But the point being, that is, that it seemed that
15       she enjoyed smoking along with all the things that are
16       depicted in the photographs that have been put in front
17       of you.  It did not in any -- there was only one picture
18       in there, you'll see it, there's one that was from the
19       Quonset hut in Hawaii, where she seemed, I don't know,
20       tired or whatever and the young children, who knows, but
21       of all those photographs and the videos that you saw
22       from, you know, down in Delray Beach, all of them, you
23       know, immensely social, enjoying herself and enjoying
24       her smoking at the same time.
25             Her sister testified that she liked the taste.

 1       And there are a number of questions in that regard  2       and -- and all of them pointed to the conclusion that
 3       taste, and you'll see more of this, was what she based
 4       her decision having to do with what cigarette she smoked
 5       on.
 6             With the exception of after she moved to Delray
 7       Beach and smoked the Carlton 120s to cut back, every
 8       cigarette prior to that, it seems, was selected based
 9       upon the taste.
10             She smoked to help her relax.  She'd rather go
11       without smoking than smoke a brand she didn't enjoy.
12       And you'll see this again.
13             There was one situation at the yacht club in
14       New Smyrna Beach where she's there with her sister and
15       she's offered a couple of different types of cigarettes,
16       she refuses them.  She'd rather go without smoking than
17       smoke one that she didn't like the taste of.
18             She controlled where she smoked.  You'll recall
19       Ralph Gibson, whether it was in his car, on his boat, in
20       their house, with Mr. Clemmons down in Delray -- Delray
21       Beach, she's out on the -- she's outside because he
22       wouldn't let her smoke in the apartment, all of which
23       are indications that she controlled where and when she
24       smoked.
25             And she never told anyone she wanted to quit, but

 1       was unable to do so.  That's, obviously, using your
 2       common sense.  Very telling.  All these years of
 3       smoking, all these interactions with friends, family,
 4       you didn't hear one person in this case testify that
 5       she -- she was interested in quitting smoking.
 6             Next.  Okay.  This is something that we're going
 7       to be spending a good bit of time on because it -- it
 8       fronts in a -- in a more specific way the concept of
 9       legal cause.  And it's in the context of Ms. Miller's --
10       excuse me, Ms. Mrozek's acknowledgment that her mother
11       was negligent in her efforts to quit smoking and that --
12       that this negligence was a partial legal cause of her
13       death.
14             Okay.  As you'll see, legal cause is a big thing.
15       It's a big thing because it's what you must establish
16       to -- to create liability.  And in order for
17       something -- as you'll hear, we're going to be going
18       over the definition of legal cause, but very simply, you
19       have to show a -- a direct and sub- -- and significant
20       impact on somebody by your actions, which is -- so -- so
21       it -- it also has to demonstrate that but for that
22       action, then the harm would not have occurred.  We're
23       going to be going over that and we're going to be going
24       over that in the context of several of the claims in
25       this case.

 1             But this is significant because what it says is
 2       that Ms. Mrozek acknowledges from a legal cause
 3       perspective that if her mother had done certain things,  4       and I'll -- I'll go over those in a minute, then as a
 5       legal cause she would not have gotten sick.
 6             Okay.  Next slide.  And here are those
 7       acknowledgments from Ms. Mrozek.  She acknowledges, as
 8       you can see, that her mother bears some responsibility
 9       for smoking the cigarettes that caused her death.
10             She acknowledges or believes that her mother bears
11       some responsibility because she didn't make a greater
12       effort to stop smoking sooner.  She could have -- she
13       indicates here, she -- she should have tried to quit,
14       tried harder to quit.
15             And, finally, you believe she bears some
16       responsibility because she didn't make a greater effort
17       to stop?
18             And, yes, I believe she could have kept trying and
19       she didn't.
20             Now, next.  Let's move to the next point here and
21       that, of course, is causation as the golden language
22       indicates.  Causation in this context means that the
23       plaintiff, and you heard Mr. Anderson in his opening
24       when he said, I don't have to prove anything, as the
25       defendant, they have to prove everything because the

 1       burden is on them.
 2             And they have to prove in the civil context by the
 3       greater weight of evidence, which is the stronger, more
 4       compelling, more credible evidence.  In this context,
 5       that Lorillard did or failed to do something that had a
 6       substantial impact on Ms. Miller's smoking, not just
 7       some impact, it must be a substantial impact.  And that
 8       has to be more than simply showing that we manufactured
 9       cigarettes that she smoked over a period of time, became
10       ill and, unfortunately, ultimately died.
11             Because, again, cigarettes are a legal product in
12       this country.  Merely making -- making them, selling
13       them, having someone use them, without proof of more, is
14       not enough in our system to impose liability on anyone.
15             The judge will make that plain in his
16       instructions.  And that's already been acknowledged by
17       plaintiff's counsel.
18             You have to -- they have to sustain their burden.
19       And if you conclude, as I suggested in my opening and
20       will continue to suggest, that -- that today, that is
21       reflected by this evidence, is the -- the evidence that
22       is before you that has been tied, connected by proof to
23       Jackie Miller does nothing more than demonstrate that we
24       made a legal product, she smoked it, unfortunately, she
25       was among those -- the small percentage that Dr. Burns

 1       testified to, that became ill and, unfortunately, died.
 2       So we'll be -- we'll be visiting more on that later.
 3             Had -- in -- I submit to you it just makes an
 4       abundance of sense, you can't -- if there's an ad that
 5       somebody -- we talked about the concept of legal cause.  6       If there's an ad that someone didn't see, then plainly
 7       that couldn't be evidence that has any bearing on a
 8       claim for liability as to them.
 9             I don't know whether you recognize it or not, but
10       in the first four-plus days when you sat here so
11       patiently and listened to those videotapes all those
12       hours, a good bit of the testimony that was advanced by
13       the plaintiff in support of -- of their case had to do
14       with the product Newport.
15             And I -- I bring that up to make the point because
16       Newport was not a cigarette that was ever smoked by
17       Ms. Miller.  In part, because it's a menthol cigarette
18       and you've heard again and again she wouldn't smoke a
19       menthol.  She didn't like a menthol cigarette.
20             So in terms of causation, things that she -- like
21       that, statements that had something to do with a product
22       that she never smoked or documents that you saw, one in
23       particular you saw twice from 1978, had --
24       referencing -- it was paraded in here twice on the issue
25       of youth marketing, that's a serious subject.

 1             But in a case where the decedent in 1978 was,
 2       what, 48 years old, a youth marketing document that --
 3       you know, anything after 1948, she wasn't a youth.
 4             So plainly, in terms of the issue of causation,
 5       while -- while whatever was in there, you know, may have
 6       been wrong, whatever, inflammatory, it's got nothing to
 7       do with this case and her claim because very plainly
 8       it -- it -- it was not connected in any way, shape or
 9       form to Ms. Miller for the reasons that I suggested.
10             Next slide.  Okay.  Legal cause.  Here it is
11       again.  And that we've put in brackets here the
12       reference in two places to wrongful conduct by my
13       client.  That's what they have to prove, that they're --
14       well, let's walk through this together.
15             This re- -- this requires that Lorillard's
16       wrongful conduct, they have to show that Lorillard
17       engaged in wrong -- wrongful conduct that is a legal
18       cause of injury.  And it is that if it directly and in
19       natural and continuous sequence produces or contributes
20       substantially to producing the injury, so that it can
21       reasonably be said, but for Lorillard's wrongful
22       conduct, the injury would not have occurred.
23             Okay.  I know that's a lot of lawyer jargon, but
24       it's still -- it's pretty straightforward.  That's why I
25       bring out the points that I've been bringing out.  It

 1       has to be -- they have to show that the wrongful conduct
 2       had a direct impact on Ms. Miller and that it -- it
 3       contributed substantially to producing the injury.
 4             And, finally, and this -- this will prove, I
 5       think, to be the most compelling of all aspects of this,
 6       at least from our perspective, is the final emphasized
 7       language here is that but for Lorillard's wrongful  8       conduct.
 9             You're going to be hearing this from me again and
10       again.  But I might as well bring it out right now.  The
11       but for language means you have to have concluded -- in
12       order for Lorillard to be, in our view, under this
13       standard, you -- the plaintiff must prove that if it
14       were not for Lorillard's cigarettes, then Ms. Miller
15       would not have smoked, she would have not -- not have
16       become ill, she would not have died.
17             And you think about why that is.  If there is
18       something that was -- had a direct and substantial
19       impact on her, then you would think that if you took
20       that away, she wouldn't be injured.  Okay.  That's what
21       the but for language there is about.
22             And we all know, remember the slide I just showed
23       you a couple minutes ago, that she smoked, what, ten
24       brands in the course of her lifetime?  Some of it was
25       kind of hard to pin down, but as you'll see here in a

 1       few minutes, she doesn't smoke a Lorillard brand past
 2       1988.
 3             All right.  And there are a number of other brands
 4       that are interspersed here and there along the way.  But
 5       the point is I think the evidence is very clear that
 6       Ms. Miller would have been a cigarette smoker and would
 7       have been a cigarette smoker all her life, even if there
 8       had not been a Lorillard Tobacco Company.
 9             Okay.  So it isn't anything that was unique to any
10       of Lorillard advertisement, Lorillard product, anything
11       about Lorillard.  And I think that as a result of that,
12       as -- as we walk through the verdict form in a few
13       minutes, this is something that will have, I would
14       submit, great significance.
15             Back -- the next -- next slide.  And here it is
16       again in a different way.  You have to have a direct
17       connection, a substantial impact on every issue in order
18       to have legal cause.
19             Now, where do we find it?  Where do we look for
20       it?  Just where we looked for it the last time, in the
21       evidence, from the witness stand, from the people who
22       came in here and raised their right hand and -- and
23       testified.
24             Next slide, please.  Before I do that, this slide,
25       as I suggested earlier, if you determine who was in

 1       control and you determine causation, who was in --
 2       who -- you know, whether or not they satisfied that
 3       element, that will tell you who is responsible for it
 4       ultimately, the issues in this case.
 5             Next slide, please.  Now, you're famil- --
 6       familiar with this and I'm not going to go over all the
 7       things by any means that I did last time, but I do want
 8       to make a number of points for each of the decades that
 9       we have spelled out here.  And the first one has to do 10       with initiation.
11             Next slide, please.  As this slide indicates, no
12       one knows why Jackie Miller started smoking.  We don't
13       know anything about her first cigarette, when she
14       started smoking, how old she was.  And -- and her sister
15       testified that she never told her that she smoked
16       because of a particular movie star or athlete.
17             And, likewise, the plaintiff, Michelle Mrozek,
18       testified that she never discussed with her mother why
19       she smoked cigarettes.
20             Next slide, please.  Now, Lou Fink, she's a -- a
21       big part of getting -- of this case because she, more
22       than anyone else, knew Jackie Miller throughout her
23       entire life, which you'll doubtless recall, this is the
24       -- this is the lady who in the 1947 time frame would
25       smoke with her on the stoop across from their school.

 1             And I asked Ms. Fink about a lot of different
 2       things because she had a lot to share with us.  One
 3       thing she told us is, as depicted here, that she had no
 4       knowledge of her friend, Ms. Miller, ever seeing or
 5       reading an ad.  And she had no knowledge that her
 6       friend, Ms. Miller, was ever influenced, even in the
 7       slightest, by any advertisement to purchase
 8       cigarettes.
 9             Yes, she remembered the -- the dancing pack from
10       Old Gold.  She testified to that.  She also remembered
11       the Lucky Strike, some advertisement from Lucky Strike.
12       But she smoked Chesterfield.
13             And she said, yeah, I remember that and it didn't
14       have an influence on me at all.  And, no, I don't know
15       from the time that I was there right with her and
16       smoking with her, two or three times a week, one or two
17       cigarettes a day, there was no mention of any
18       advertising and I don't know anything about that.
19             And really that's the sum and substance of all the
20       testimony in the 1940s about Ms. Miller smoking and is
21       the only brand testimony that is specific in the 1940s.
22       So that's -- that's all there is to offer on that.
23             Now, next slide, please.  Now, I put a new
24       reference down here on the bottom, 1946, the Parmele
25       memo.  You'll recall that the Parmele memo was the very

 1       first document that the plaintiff put before you after
 2       we finished listening to all those videos.  And it was a
 3       letter that talked about cigarette smoke and benzpyrene.
 4       And what -- it was directed to my client and that's as
 5       far as it went.
 6             But as you saw yesterday, there was a response
 7       and there was action taken.  There was, what I would
 8       submit, may have been surprising to you, an ongoing
 9       effort after the Parmele memo by my client to take
10       action to get to the bottom of things that had been
11       raised in that memo. 12             Next slide, please.  Here's the memo itself.
13             Next slide.  And here are the things that were
14       referenced yesterday when my partner, Mr. Woods, was
15       intro- -- introducing evidence that should be still
16       pretty fresh in your recollection.
17             There was work done on the evaluation of cigarette
18       smoke, that it was commissioned by Lorillard at the Ohio
19       State University in the 1940s.  And perhaps even more
20       compelling than that is the -- is -- are the documents
21       in the '50s and '60s reflecting joint efforts by
22       Lorillard, along with Dr. Ernst Wynd- -- Wynder and
23       Dr. Dietrich Hoffmann, who you saw a lot about.
24             These were the gentlemen who were at the forefront
25       of the effort on -- from the public health community

 1       side to get to the bottom of what the true -- the truth
 2       is having to do with cigarette smoking.  And here they
 3       are arm-and-arm with Lorillard working with them, as the
 4       evidence depicted yesterday, in the '50s and 1960s.
 5             You also saw references to submissions to the
 6       Surgeon General's Advisory Committee, which included
 7       that big green book they called the green monster, which
 8       was commissioned by the -- the cigarette manufacturers
 9       and paid for.
10             And what -- what they did was, if you'll recall,
11       is gather up 6,000 or so of all the studies that had
12       been conducted up to that time and gave them to the
13       committee in an effort to assist them in their
14       undertaking as the Surgeon General's Advisory
15       Committee.
16             And as you saw, there was an expression of
17       appreciation and gratitude, both, individually to
18       Lorillard and to the industry as a whole by the Surgeon
19       General himself in 1964.
20             Have reference here to the Tobacco Working Group,
21       which is -- was referenced at some length during the
22       testimony of Dr. Robinson at the outset of the case.
23       And that was an example -- that's the National Cancer
24       Institute and Tobacco Working Group that worked together
25       in the late '60s and early '70s in an effort to get to

 1       the bottom of how can you make a safer cigarette?  It
 2       was a joint effort.  And Lorillard participated in that
 3       -- in that effort as well.
 4             Finally, work that was done with the National
 5       Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine that involves
 6       the sharing of ingredient information more recently, in
 7       the year 2000.
 8             Next slide.  Now, I put this in here because it
 9       depicts some of the -- the principal folks that are
10       involved in this case and the experiences that they had
11       that influenced the decisions that were made.  And the
12       most notable, obviously, is Ms. Miller there in the
13       center and Harold Read and Lou Read. 14             Lou Read, of course, now is Louise Fink.  And
15       Harold Read is her husband at the time, who, as you
16       recall, had the misfortune of a smoking-related illness.
17       We'll be talking more about him in a little while.  One
18       of the --
19             Okay.  The -- let's move along here.  Next slide.
20       1950s.  I already told you about the smoking brand
21       testimony in the '40s.  The -- the first mention of
22       cigarette smoking in -- in a brand specific way is this
23       first entry here in 1950, '51, is Helen Schumacher who
24       you'll recall testified.  She's the lady that worked at
25       the New Smyrna Beach City Hall with Ms. Miller.  And

 1       she -- she referenced that she gave, as a Christmas
 2       gift, at the request of Ms. Miller, two cartons of
 3       Chesterfield cigarettes, which are brands that are not
 4       made by my client.  That is the only testimony of a
 5       brand between 1951 and 1959 except for the testimony of
 6       Carol Gibson.
 7             And I want to spend a minute here because I want
 8       to go through that because when I sit down, I won't have
 9       an opportunity to address you again.  And I don't know
10       what Mr. Patacca will say once I sit down, so I have to
11       address what I'm going to address while I'm here and
12       while I have the floor.
13             Let me just make something very plain here.
14       Lorillard does not in any way, shape or form challenge
15       the fact that Ms. Miller smoked our brand from 1959
16       until the late '70s.  There's no dispute about that at
17       all.  The Kent brand specifically is what I'm referring
18       to.
19             And we also don't dispute that she smoked Max
20       sometime in the '80s.  We don't know for how long
21       really, but we know that by the time she moved to Delray
22       Beach in, say, '88, '89, she was no longer smoking our
23       brand.
24             Okay.  So we're not in any way, shape or form --
25       and that's a lot of years.  We're not running from that

 1       at all.  I admit that straight up.
 2             The only thing that I take a little bit of issue
 3       with, and he hasn't conceded it yet, so I want to bring
 4       it up to you so that you can understand where I'm coming
 5       from and why and it's based on the evidence.
 6             As you'll recall, Ms. Miller's sister, Carol
 7       Gibson, testified here at some length.  She testified
 8       about, first of all, the fact she had an initial
 9       deposition, I think it was December 16th, 2009.  And we
10       asked her all the usual stuff, you know, everything you
11       know about -- particularly with a family member, a -- a
12       sister of the decedent, you try and be very careful to
13       get all the facts.  And we did.
14             And she testified in that deposition that her
15       sister -- she had first recollection of her sister 16       smoking the Kent brand was in 19- -- when -- was when
17       she went to see her in Hawaii in 1959 or 1960, which
18       made sense, because in those days Ms. -- Ms. Gibson
19       would have been 15 or 16 years of age, still pretty darn
20       young.
21             And she said that, when pressed on it, she --
22       she -- in her first deposition, she said, well, maybe it
23       might have been earlier.  But then she caught her -- but
24       then she said, no, all I can really say -- all I really
25       remember is 1959, 1960, that time frame.

 1             And the only reason I bring it up is because
 2       the -- the second deposition that she gave some nine
 3       months later, after her words, obsessing about her first
 4       testimony, her first deposition, after spending numerous
 5       hours going over it, she then filled out the Errata
 6       Sheet and didn't change that testimony, didn't change
 7       her testimony as it relates to when she remembers her
 8       sister smoking the Kent brand.
 9             And then nine months later, she's on a telephone
10       call with Mr. Anderson and says, well, I -- I've -- I've
11       remembered some other things or words to that effect.
12       And the following week he's on a plane to Atlanta to go
13       visit her.  And she testified that part of her
14       motivation for visiting with him was in an effort to
15       help her niece, Michelle Mrozek, prevail in this case.
16             And as a result of that meeting, another
17       deposition was taken and she expanded her testimony from
18       1959 back into this time frame when she was ten years of
19       age.
20             Okay.  And what she did to support that was she
21       brought in a picture.  Can we pull that picture up,
22       please?
23             She brought in three pictures to be more specific.
24       And on direct she testified that the two pictures below,
25       because they were in a mobile home, those were in

 1       St. Petersburg when the mobile home was down there in
 2       1959, absolutely consistent with the time frame I'm
 3       talking about.
 4             But then she said with this photograph here, this
 5       was 1954.  And that puzzled me, I -- I must tell you.
 6       It puzzled me, I'm sitting there looking at these
 7       photos, all the furniture, the drapes and everything,
 8       granted there's a baby in the two below and, obviously,
 9       that's the plaintiff and she wasn't born until 1959.
10             But what about this -- ultimately, I had to ask
11       her, you said this photograph here is from 1954.  And
12       the reason is there's a pack of Kent sitting right here.
13       Okay.  And I asked her, you brought two stacks of
14       photographs to your deposition, that photograph wasn't
15       in there.  She acknowledged it wasn't.  She said it
16       wasn't hers.  She didn't know where it came from.
17             Then I asked her, well, then, what distinguishing 18       characteristics -- on what basis did you testify that
19       that photo was from 1954?
20             You'll recall what she said.  She said, It was an
21       assumption.  That's all it was.
22             And I'll submit to you that is an assumption --
23       that's an illustration of someone, I would submit, who
24       is, in fact, by that time, trying to extend her
25       assistance in this cause in a way that shouldn't be

 1       credible.  Okay.  This -- this -- this is a search for
 2       the truth.  It isn't a search for assumptions.
 3             Now, why does that matter?  Why does that matter
 4       that if we acknowledge the smoking in -- from 1959 on?
 5       Well, very simply because the plaintiff is trying to say
 6       that the advertisements of the greatest health
 7       protection for the Kent brand influenced Jackie Miller
 8       and it's -- it's very convenient for them, if she
 9       happened to start smoking that brand at the very limited
10       time those advertisements ran.  In 1954, in 1955 are the
11       only times those -- those ads ran.
12             And as you'll see, rather than being the success
13       during '54 and '55, that -- that plaintiff suggests that
14       it was as a result of the advertisement, the --
15             Take it down, please.  Next slide.  That rather
16       than being the big success, the sales of the Kent
17       cigarette did not go up during the time frame that those
18       ads ran.  They went down.  There was a reduction in
19       sales, in the volume for the Kent brand in 1955 during
20       the time frame that those ads ran.
21             It wasn't until much later when, in 1957, you've
22       heard about it, the Reader's Digest article ran.  And
23       Reader's Digest, not Lorillard Tobacco Company,
24       published an article which -- which concluded that the
25       Kent filter was more effective than the filters on other

 1       brands.
 2             And that's what prompted a spike, not the
 3       suggestion that an ineffective ad, which apparently few
 4       people paid attention to, was a success or had an impact
 5       on people in the marketplace.
 6             But what's significant here, even if you indulge
 7       that testimony, and, obviously, I would suggest that for
 8       all those reasons and there's -- there's more, that the
 9       second deposition of Carol Gibson should not be taken as
10       credible.
11             In fact, she -- on the witness stand, when trying
12       to still support that testimony, you'll recall at the
13       end of her examination, she was asked whether she
14       understood that she was supposed to make substantive
15       changes.  And she said, no, I -- I didn't realize that.
16       And then I came back up to -- to the -- the lector and
17       reminded her and showed her where, in fact, she was
18       asked that specific question and she had to admit she
19       did, in fact, know that at the time. 20             That said, moving on.  No.  Back up, please.  The
21       evidence here from Ms. Mrozek is that she recognizes, as
22       depicted here, that her mother never switched.  She
23       doesn't have any knowledge of her mother ever switching
24       brands because of an ad, ever.
25             And, likewise, Ms. Gibson, to your knowledge, she

 1       never purchased cigarettes because of an ad?
 2             To my knowledge, I never heard her say she was
 3       purchasing a cigarette because of the advertisement.
 4             And to your understanding, and this is the point I
 5       made earlier, your sister bought the cigarettes that she
 6       liked?
 7             Answer:  My understanding is that she bought the
 8       cigarettes that she liked.
 9             Now, let's go to the slide that makes the point on
10       the -- the sales.  One more.  Next.  This is a slide
11       that makes my point for me and makes it graphically.  As
12       I've -- as the testimony was brought -- was provided by
13       Ms. Leung, that greatest health protection that
14       you're -- you've been hearing about, those ads ran here
15       in '54 and '55.  They stopped.  That's when the --
16       the -- the constraints -- the restrictions were imposed
17       on cigarette advertising.  You'll hear more about that
18       as we go forward.
19             But the point is, here in 1955 when that ad's
20       running, when Mr. Patacca suggests that that was such a
21       big thing, that that ad had such an influence, what
22       does it -- what happens?  It goes from a 1.0 market
23       share to a .7 and it stays here at .8.  Then it doesn't
24       begin to go up, until, guess what, 1957.  1957.  Years
25       after that ad ran for the last time.

 1             This is evidence.  This isn't surmise.  Okay.
 2       This is what is common sense, I would submit, will tell
 3       you what happened here.  And that is that when that ad
 4       ran and for no other reason, the endorsement that was
 5       provided by publication, which was the most widely read
 6       publication in the United States in those days and a
 7       publication, which you'll recall from all of those
 8       things you saw yesterday, had repeatedly written
 9       articles warning folks about the risks of smoking.  They
10       come out and say that, in fact, this particular filter,
11       if you're going to smoke a filter, should be the one
12       that you smoke.  And it had that effect.  And I must
13       tell you, is that ever since -- you see that 8.3 going
14       down to 8.2 and 8.0, it has continued downward to a
15       point.
16             Whereas, you recall from Kristy Leung's testimony,
17       they don't even support Kent as a -- as a brand where
18       they would be running ads anymore.  It is a very small
19       fraction of Lorillard's business.  Notwithstanding what
20       it did back when and for the obvious reason that it
21       was -- it was tallied by someone unconnected with 22       Lorillard Tobacco Company.
23             Next slide, please.  The suggestion about health
24       and concern about health in the cigarettes go, we asked
25       Ms. Gibson whether she -- her sister had ever said

 1       anything about choosing a filtered cigarette because she
 2       felt they were healthier.
 3             She never said they were healthier.
 4             Likewise, your sister never told you she chose one
 5       because they're healthier, right?
 6             She never told me that.
 7             Okay.  Wouldn't you think if that were a fact that
 8       why she was choosing that brand, that she might have
 9       told her sister that at some point in time?  And the
10       evidence clearly is that she never did.
11             Okay.  Moving on.  Next slide.  Now, the -- we're
12       about through here with the decade of the '50s and I'll
13       try and pick up the pace here a little bit.  But I
14       wanted to -- to deal with the issue of Carol Gibson's
15       testimony before I got through this.
16             One other thing before I leave Ms. Gibson, and I
17       don't mean to pick on her, but I think it illustrates a
18       point.  One other thing -- and -- and she was only, as I
19       said, ten years old at the time.  Remember her testimony
20       that her sister moved out in -- -- when she was in --
21       when Ms. Gibson was in the second grade?  That's roughly
22       1949.  She didn't move back into the home until August
23       of 1954.  Ms. Miller was up in Memphis, Tennessee, or
24       elsewhere.  She wasn't in the home until the summer,
25       late summer 1954.  She got married, as you'll recall.

 1       She eloped in December of 1954.
 2             So the sum and substance of the entire time -- the
 3       entire time that Ms. Miller lived with Carol Gibson was
 4       between August '54 and December 1954 in the entire
 5       decade of the 1950s.  That's what the testimony says.
 6             Also one other point on that and to illustrate
 7       what I would submit is a failure of memory.  Billie
 8       Carter Dawson came in here on videotape and testified, I
 9       was at the -- in Folkston, Georgia, for the wedding.  I
10       was there.  She was an adult at the time, young adult,
11       but she was an adult nonetheless.
12             Carol Gibson is asked about that very subject and
13       is emphatic, no, she wasn't there.  Well, she was a
14       ten-year-old.  And contradicting someone who came in
15       here, you had the opportunity to -- to observe, and I
16       dare say, would have an all likelihood far better
17       recollection of the facts.
18             All of which points to -- to the -- to the fact
19       that in terms of these childhood recollections from
20       Ms. Gibson with a stated purpose that she's acknowledged
21       behind her testimony, all I'm saying is 1959 or
22       thereabouts is when the evidence depicts that Ms. Miller
23       started smoking the Kent brand. 24             One more thing, The Frank Statement.  Again,
25       there's no testimony here -- you can call it up.

 1       There's no testimony here that Ms. Miller -- this was
 2       published one day in 1954.  There's no testimony here
 3       linking, connecting this -- this statement to Jackie
 4       Miller.  There's no one that came in here, we asked
 5       everyone, obviously, no one ever said she saw and heard
 6       about it or had any familiarity with it at all.
 7             Next slide, please.  Finally, regulation of
 8       cigarettes in the '50s.  The cigarette advertising
 9       guides come out, Lorillard meets with the FTC.  And
10       beginning in 1958, and this is important, Lorillard,
11       beginning in 1958, pre-clears its advertisements with
12       the Federal Trade Commission.
13             So you're not seeing -- there aren't any Santas
14       and puppy dogs or greatest health protection.  There's
15       none of that because everything beginning in 1958 and
16       thereafter is proved by the Federal Trade Commission
17       before it's utilized.
18             Next slide, please.  We're in the '60s.  The first
19       entry here that I'd like to discuss is 1962.  That's
20       where Mr. Ralph Gibson, who testified here the other day
21       and who testified about his smoking history and how he
22       knew the risks of smoking back in the 1950s, quit
23       because of that awareness and then chose to resume in
24       1959, smoking a filter.
25             Let's pull up his -- his acknowledgment.  Now,

 1       what does he say?
 2             You knew about the health risks of smoking since
 3       1950?
 4             Yes.
 5             And this was an electrical engineer.  This wasn't
 6       a doctor.  This wasn't anyone with any specialized
 7       training.
 8             He said:  You also saw things in ads and on the
 9       news in '62 that further illustrated to you that
10       cigarettes were hazardous or potentially hazardous to
11       your health, correct?
12             Yes.
13             So in '62 you decided to quit smoking because you
14       believed it was the only way to protect yourself from
15       the health risks that accompany smoking?
16             You concluded it wasn't safe to continue smoking
17       at that time even if you were smoking filtered
18       cigarettes?
19             And this fellow had resumed smoking for a number
20       of years, he smoked filtered cigarettes.  And this is
21       before the Surgeon General's report, this is before
22       labels on any packs and this is just an ordinary, you
23       know, walking around, nice guy who came in here and
24       testified and shared his experience during that same
25       time frame.  And he's roughly -- he's in the same -- 4019
 1       about the same age as -- as Ms. Miller was.
 2             Now, next slide.  Now, next thing of great
 3       significance in the '60s, obviously, is the Surgeon
 4       General's general report on smoking and health is
 5       released.
 6             Next slide.  Publication.  Notoriety.  You've seen
 7       it.  It's here.  Here's -- but some examples, all of
 8       which I think you've already seen.  The one that is --
 9       was prominent there at the top is the Honolulu Star
10       Bulletin.
11             Next slide.  And we've got some callouts here and
12       this is from the front page of the newspaper in Honolulu
13       where Ms. Miller and her husband, Robert or Bob, was
14       then living, as you can see and as you've heard.  This
15       article points out that cigarette smoking far outweighs
16       all other causes of lung cancer in men and the data for
17       women point in the same direction.
18             Point being there was a great amount of notoriety
19       given to this, not only in -- here in the states, but
20       even as far as Hawaii where Ms. -- Ms. Miller was then
21       living.
22             Next slide.  Okay.  Now, just to point out the
23       friends, her friends, Ms. Miller's friends.  Now, I
24       excerpted a couple of them.  Helen Schumacher, a
25       nonsmoker, you know, what does she acknowledge?  She

 1       acknowledges here that while she didn't always read the
 2       paper thoroughly, she knew in 1964 when the Surgeon
 3       General announced that cigarette smoking was dangerous,
 4       she remembers that.
 5             Next slide.  Louise Fink and Carol Gibson on the
 6       same issue.  Ms. Fink acknowledged, as you can see, that
 7       that message about the Surgeon General's report was
 8       something she heard in New Smyrna.  Obviously, she's the
 9       same age and living there at the -- at -- where
10       Ms. Miller lived most of her life.  She acknowledges and
11       that was communicated generally in New Smyrna, like
12       everywhere else.
13             Finally at the bottom here, Carol Gibson.  Of
14       course, Ms. Gibson, as you -- as you'll recall, not only
15       acknowledges that, but then she uses that knowledge and
16       information as -- as further impetus to do something
17       else with her sister and her sister's smoking at that
18       point in time.
19             Next slide, please.  The other thing that happened
20       in the '60s, quite obviously, from a governmental
21       standpoint, is the warning label in 1966.  Let's call
22       that up quickly.  Which, obviously, we've heard a lot
23       about cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health.
24       And that, of course, was on every -- on every pack of
25       cigarettes beginning at that time.  And some variation

 1       of that has been on there ever since.  2             Now, the -- the other thing of great significance
 3       to this case in the 1960s, I would suggest, is that,
 4       first of all, unfortunately, Ms. Miller's father dies at
 5       the age of 52 in 1960.  And he's a cigarette smoker.
 6             Next slide, please.  And Ms. Gibson, when the --
 7       as -- has testified, as you heard, that after she
 8       started seeing the warnings on the packs and just a few
 9       years earlier having lost her father, who was a smoker,
10       to lung cancer, we asked her whether she has started
11       associating her father's passing with his smoking?
12             And she did.  She nonetheless continued smoking.
13       And we asked her and she acknowledged that she told her
14       sister that she believed that her father's lung cancer
15       was due to his smoking in the 1960s.
16             And as you've heard, she went on to testify
17       that -- words to the effect, it hasn't been proved.  But
18       there's something which, you know, if credited, that
19       testimony from Ms. Gibson reflects that -- that her
20       sister had the same right to make her decision as to
21       whether to continue smoking, just as she did at the
22       time.
23             Ms. Gibson acknowledged the connection, believed
24       the connection, chose to continue smoking.  That was her
25       choice to make and anything that flowed from that would

 1       be, obviously, her responsibility as well.
 2             Likewise, you know, this is a free country.
 3       Ms. Miller could do as she pleased in that regard.  And
 4       she made that decision at that time and she was entitled
 5       to do so, but there are other things going on as well
 6       that I would submit have a bearing on whether or not,
 7       you know, you would credit that testimony or that
 8       decision and -- and very simply it's this.
 9             As you'll recall, the plaintiff, Michelle Mrozek,
10       in the same time frame this is happening in the late
11       1960s, is telling her aunt, Carol Gibson, when Ms. --
12       Ms. Mrozek is roughly ten years old, she tells her, my
13       lungs are pink and yours are black.
14             Okay.  Next slide.  And here it is.
15             Do you recall an exchange with the plaintiff back
16       at the time where she said, in essence, your lungs are
17       pink and yours are black?
18             She says:  Exactly.  It's sort of an
19       out-of-mouth-of-babes moment that had an impact on you
20       that you remember more than 40 years later, right?
21             And she says:  Exactly.
22             And you -- when you heard it, your reaction was
23       you thought she's right.
24             Okay.  What do you think the likelihood is that if
25       she's telling her aunt, who would come down periodically

 1       to visit, these things, what do you think the likelihood
 2       is that as a ten year old, the plaintiff in this case
 3       didn't say the very same thing to her mother within  4       years of her father passing?
 5             Okay.  And close proximity in time to accompany
 6       the warning labels going on the pack.  I dare say it's
 7       very unlikely that she didn't tell, but that would be an
 8       assumption and I'm not crediting -- I'm not suggesting
 9       you assume anything.  But by the same token, you don't
10       check your common sense at the door, you know.  Here's a
11       ten year old saying these things to her aunt at the same
12       time her mother's smoking in the same household with
13       her.
14             One other thing.  Next slide.  And this is just an
15       aside here.  And -- and -- because Mr. Reasoner sums it
16       up, I think, pretty -- pretty aptly at -- at the very
17       point in time that we're talking about here with the
18       Surgeon General's report.
19             He says, and I quote, In this kind of country, it
20       comes down to you, whether you like it or not.  No one
21       is going to forbid an adult to smoke.  It's now quite
22       clear that no one is going to tell him it's good for him
23       either.
24             Just like Michelle Mrozek was telling her aunt
25       that her smoking at that time wasn't good for her.

 1             Okay.  Next slide.  One other -- a couple of
 2       things here.  Late 1960s, same time frame these
 3       conversations are occurring, what's the proof?  The
 4       proof is that Bob Miller quit smoking himself at that
 5       point in time.  So not only do you have these
 6       conversations occurring both with mother and -- and --
 7       well, excuse me, with plaintiff and aunt, you -- and
 8       you have the first husband quitting smoking himself as
 9       well.
10             Also you have the final entry here that I wanted
11       to mention and I -- before I move on, Jackie Miller
12       refuses sale of Marlboro when she runs out of Kent.
13       This is another situation described from the stand by
14       Ms. Miller -- excuse me, by Ms. Gibson where she
15       testified, and we have a slide on that, that her sister
16       ran out of cigarettes occasionally.  Ms. Gibson at the
17       time was smoking Salem, which is a menthol cigarettes --
18       cigarette, she turned it down.  Another gentleman who
19       was there that evening offered her a Marlboro and she
20       turned that down.
21             Next.  And it went on.  She disliked Marlboros and
22       she -- when she was offered one, she turned it down.
23       And so rather than smoking something she didn't like,
24       she chose not to smoke on that particular occasion.
25             It's -- it's an example of control.  It's an

 1       example of why she smoked and -- and what prompted her
 2       to smoke.  This isn't somebody that was smoking to
 3       get -- certainly not in this exchange, it was for taste.
 4       It was what -- she wouldn't smoking if she didn't like
 5       it.  So that -- that's what that point, I would submit,  6       illustrates from that exchange then.
 7             One -- one further slide and I'm moving on.
 8       1960s, regulation of cigarettes, we have the Cigarette
 9       Advertising Code, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and
10       Advertising Act, again '66, warning label and the Public
11       Health Smoking Act.  All of which are, as you'll see in
12       each general -- each decade as we roll further, the
13       regulations imposed limiting smoking, limiting and
14       increasing requirements and constraints on cigarette
15       smoking become more pronounced each year.  And, of
16       course, Lorillard each step of the way is in compliance
17       with those, as the evidence has already depicted.
18             Next slide.  We're now in the '70s.  One -- thank
19       you.  We're now in the '70s and the -- let me see.  The
20       first entry here there's a significance because it comes
21       right on the heels of this time when she's suggesting
22       that her -- when Carol Gibson is suggesting her sister
23       told her that she didn't believe it.
24             Well, the -- what some might call an equivocal
25       sort of cautionary statement on the packs in 1966

 1       becomes much more strident in 1970, in November.  Let's
 2       pull that up, please.  When the warning label becomes --
 3       no longer says caution, then no longer says maybe, it
 4       says, as you can see, Warning:  The Surgeon General has
 5       determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your
 6       health.
 7             So there that is on every pack of cigarettes that
 8       Ms. Miller smoked and anyone else smoked, obviously,
 9       from that point on until they changed again in 1985.
10             Interestingly about this warning label -- let's go
11       back, the next slide.  The only offspring of Ms. Miller
12       who didn't become a regular smoker was her son, Robert,
13       who testified here.  And as this testimony reflects, and
14       I -- I want to share it with you because I think it's
15       significant.  If I understood Mr. Patacca's remarks
16       earlier, I think he was acknowledging that maybe she
17       knew the risks of smoking in the '80s somewhere,
18       something to that effect.
19             Her son, Robert, who was a nonsmoker testified
20       that he knew the risks of smoking in 1973 when he was
21       13, he knew it was bad for his health, he knew about the
22       Surgeon General -- he knew -- as you can see here, he
23       learned that smoking can lead to cancer from the Surgeon
24       General's warnings when he was 15 or 16.
25             And he -- he also acknowledges that he already was

 1       aware that smoking was hazardous to his health before he
 2       saw the warnings.  And he, too, for most of his young
 3       life, lived with his mother and he knew those things
 4       from a variety of sources.  In all likelihood, from the
 5       packs of cigarettes that she had of her own as well.
 6             Next slide.  Now, the -- the next entry here
 7       that's of significance that I'd like to share with you  8       for a minute here is in '74 when Jackie Miller's close
 9       friend, Louise Fink's husband, Harold Read, dies from
10       lung cancer due to smoking.  This is a significant
11       effect because any one of us who lost a friend or had a
12       dear friend whose spouse died, particularly at a young
13       age, particularly when you think back to the photos like
14       I showed you earlier of them on the beach doing things
15       together and he's in the picture and Louise is in the
16       picture and Ms. Miller's in the picture, you know.
17             Here in 1974, Ms. Miller is -- is -- Louise Fink
18       testified, she believes that she was at the funeral.
19       They were close friends, in the same town.  She doesn't
20       recall, given the number of people who were present,
21       specifically if she was there.
22             Next slide.  And there you have it.  We don't know
23       the -- the specific date.  Well, I think this may be
24       back from the '50s, but at any rate, close-knit group,
25       did a lot of things together.  You heard the testimony.

 1       And this should have been a significant event in terms
 2       of alerting Ms. Miller if she wanted to quit smoking.
 3             But I keep coming back to that because, you know,
 4       I would submit to you -- and whether she looked at the
 5       photographs, she looked at the action or the lack of
 6       action, I would submit to you, you know -- I didn't
 7       touch upon it this time, but you'll recall there was
 8       a -- a quit in 1956 when -- and -- when she was living
 9       in Gainesville.  And the next time there's any evidence
10       of a quit is 30 years thereafter.
11             I would submit to you that that -- and that --
12       with the fact that there's never any suggestion that
13       she -- in conversation with anyone that she wanted to
14       quit, I think that our record here is pretty clear that
15       Ms. Miller never really wanted very much to quit
16       smoking.  She may have wanted to cut back on her
17       smoking, but in terms of quitting, as you'll see as we
18       finish this timeline, there's very little, other than
19       what I've described in that regard.
20             Now, next slide.  1977, Billie Carter Dawson, the
21       lady who she lived with in Memphis, Tennessee, and lived
22       with her in 1954 and New Smyrna Beach, quit smoking.
23       She told us about it from the stand.  She quit smoking
24       because her mother-in-law had emphysema.  Again,
25       something that ordinarily would -- would put someone on

 1       notice if you wanted to do something about your
 2       situation and your own behavior, if you were concerned
 3       about it, if you wanted to do something about it.  And
 4       Billie Dawson quits there, as the others will soon
 5       follow suit.
 6             Late '70s, we see for the first time Jackie Miller
 7       starts smoking the Max cigarettes that there have been
 8       some reference to.  And there was testimony here that in
 9       between the Kent and the Max that perhaps she smoked 10       Mores and Mistys, both of which are not brands -- are
11       brands that are not made by the Lorillard Tobacco
12       Company.  But the important thing here is that she
13       didn't switch to Max out of a health concern.
14             Next slide.  Max was introduced in 1975, as you
15       know.  It's no longer even on the market.  The
16       suggestion that Lorillard was really good at marketing,
17       remember the -- the bar graph for Max?  It looked like a
18       flat line from the start.  It never went anywhere.  It
19       no longer is on the market and had a very short life.
20             The smoke fewer ads that were referred to before
21       by plaintiff's counsel in his opening are referenced
22       here in the time frame that they were utilized as
23       depicted here.  The testimony here is very clear that
24       Ms. Miller liked long, slender cigarettes generally.
25       She was -- she was buying cigarettes for the plaintiff,

 1       her daughter, Michelle, at this time.
 2             And as we've already seen, there is no testimony
 3       at all from anyone that she bought cigarettes because of
 4       an ad.  And every single Max cigarette that she
 5       purchased, of course, had the Surgeon General's warning
 6       on it.
 7             Next, please.  Next slide.  Okay.  Rounding out
 8       the '70s, the regulations, again, are depicted here,
 9       cigarettes ads are removed from the TV, cigarette
10       General -- Surgeon General's warnings are required in
11       all advertisements and the FTC requires tar and nicotine
12       disclosure on the facts.
13             Next slide.  So now we're in the '80s.  First part
14       of the '80s I'd like to spend time on is the reference
15       to -- well, the -- Dr. Darby and Louise Fink.  As you
16       recall, Dr. Darby is the personal physician who read the
17       so-called Riot Act to Ms. Fink in the early 1980s.
18             Let's go to that slide, please.  And she relates
19       here how the doctor came to the hospital and motivated
20       her to quit smoking by pointing out and telling her, You
21       damn well better quit now or you're not going to see
22       your grandchildren.
23             This is a lady who was smoking in the '40s and who
24       had been friends with Ms. Miller throughout all the
25       years.  And she, like Billie Dawson, uses this

 1       encouragement from her physician to make a decision,
 2       exert the effort, quit smoking.
 3             And I thought it particularly telling because this
 4       is the same physician at that time, it seems, from a
 5       variety of witnesses that Ms. Miller was seeing as her
 6       own personal physician.  Now, you know, you've got to
 7       ask yourself, what's the likelihood that Dr. Darby was
 8       telling Louise Fink these things and not telling Jackie
 9       Swann Miller?
10             Next slide.  This is something that we haven't
11       really talked about, but I thought it would be an 12       appropriate time to talk about it right here.  Because
13       Dr. Burns, who is plaintiff's expert, came in here and
14       testified about, among other things, risk reduction.
15       And if I heard him correctly, Mr. Patacca was saying
16       that she knew the risks of smoking in the 1980s.  Well,
17       obviously, I would submit the evidence shows it was
18       long -- much earlier than that, but if -- you know, if
19       you look at this, he testified that if someone quit
20       smoking for five years of nonsmoking, your risk -- just
21       five years, your risk would be reduced 60 percent.  60
22       percent.
23             If she had quit in 1980 when her dear friend,
24       Louise Fink, quit, then what's that, almost 15 years,
25       give or take, that's 80 percent, 80 percent.  And that's

 1       from plaintiff's own risk reduction expert.  That's his
 2       testimony.
 3             Now, who's responsible for that?  Who's
 4       responsible for that choice?  You know, and it's -- it's
 5       here for your own consideration.  And -- and not -- you
 6       know, when you see -- you know, you're -- you're just
 7       thankful when you see Louise Fink, she made that choice
 8       and she was here with us all these years later to
 9       testify, I would submit, because she did, in fact, make
10       that decision herself.
11             Now, Joan Hall.  Next slide.  Joan Hall, as you
12       can see here, we're talking about Louise Fink, this is
13       the lady that had the double elopement with.  She
14       quit -- quit smoking in 1981.  She's the third of her
15       friends to quit back in that time frame.  What does that
16       tell you?  What does that tell you?
17             I would submit what it -- what it begins to
18       suggest is that Ms. Miller wasn't motivated to quit
19       smoking, that like all those pictures where she is
20       enjoying herself, which she had every right to do, she
21       was enjoying herself and enjoying her smoking while
22       doing so.
23             And there's -- and there's one other aspect to
24       that.  There's one other aspect to that.  There is no
25       doubt in my mind -- and certainly there's no doubt in my

 1       mind that Ms. Mrozek and her siblings very much loved
 2       their mother throughout their lives, very much cared
 3       about her.
 4             Likewise, Ms. -- Ms. Gibson, although I've had
 5       take -- taken issue with some of her testimony, I have
 6       absolutely no question that she was close with her
 7       sister, loved her and misses her.
 8             Okay.  Likewise, Ralph Gibson, he only knew her
 9       the last ten years of her life.  They were married --
10       they were married in '87, they met in '84.  Okay.  So he
11       knew her from '84 to '94.
12             And you remember the testimony, he sat on the --
13       out in the -- the fog's rolling in on -- on Lake Lanier 14       up in Georgia, he's sitting out on the boat and Jackie
15       Miller's making the coffee and they're sitting there
16       together and she's smoking a cigarette.  This is an
17       ardent anti-smoker, ardent.
18             And, you know, I asked him about that.  And wait a
19       minute, you're -- you're there with her, nobody's
20       around, you feel this way about smoking and you don't
21       say anything to her?  And he said, I believe it was her
22       choice and -- and her right, as an adult, to choose
23       whether she wanted to smoke.  And I don't doubt that
24       that's absolutely the truth.
25             And, likewise, a similar explanation is all that I

 1       can come up with to explain why no one in the family at
 2       any time, including the plaintiff, and I asked her about
 3       it, none of them ever suggested to Ms. Miller that --
 4       that she quit smoking.  Okay.  Not once.
 5             And the only explanation given that we absolutely
 6       are sure that they cared about her is that they all came
 7       to the conclusion, they must have, that she wanted to
 8       smoke, she made the decision to smoke and that they were
 9       going to indulge that adult decision.
10             I can't think of any other way to credibly put
11       together the facts that have come in on the motivation
12       for the things that have happened -- that did happen to
13       Ms. Miller in her life as it relates to her smoking.
14       And that's the only way that I think it makes any sense.
15             And I think that like Mr. -- Mr. Gibson said, she
16       certainly was entitled to have made that decision and
17       this is a free country.  You have the right to make
18       decisions that puts yourself at risk.  And she did.  And
19       they apparently concluded that she did because they
20       never said anything.
21             Let's move on.  Rotating warnings on the pack, you
22       know those, 1985, smoking causes lung cancer.  And
23       following up on Dr. Burns' testimony, the second warning
24       here, quitting now greatly reduces serious risks to your
25       health.  You just saw that.  80 percentage of reduction

 1       of risk, even if it's for as short a period as five
 2       years.
 3             Next.  Again, in the '80s, with her friends, all
 4       these people who loved her, who she enjoyed spending
 5       time with, did -- you know, her -- her life was
 6       intertwined with these folks and should be.  But the
 7       only explanation -- and -- and -- and you look how happy
 8       she appears to be while smoking.
 9             And think back to the -- think back to the -- and
10       this is in the '80s, the Delray Beach clip when she's
11       doing a video chip for her -- for her daughter who was
12       still then -- Malia was still in Germany, and, you know,
13       very matter of fact, you know, this is where I smoke
14       cigarettes out here and look at the ocean in the
15       morning. 16             All right.  That's not someone -- that's not
17       something, if you're trying to distance yourself from
18       that with your children, I would submit to you, that's
19       not something you would make so prominent.  She was very
20       casual about it, which she had every right to be.
21             But I think if you look at that, it's -- it -- you
22       know, pictures, you know, says a thousand words.  That
23       film, in that respect, I would suggest, makes very plain
24       her attitude about that subject.
25             And there's nothing wrong with that.  It may not

 1       be, you know, prudent, you know, as a long-term health
 2       decision, but she had the right to make that decision.
 3       And -- and she seems to be very happy in each and every
 4       photograph.  I mean, this -- you know, this is not
 5       anything different than all the others that you've seen
 6       and I'm confident that you're well aware of that.
 7             Next slide.  Okay.  Another insight I would
 8       suggest to Ms. Miller's attitude about smoking comes
 9       from the fact that her daughter, Michelle, in 1986 and
10       we talked about this in the opening, quit smoking for
11       several months in 1986 after she had married her
12       husband, Ed.  And she related, as you may recall,
13       that she quit, using a book on negative reinforcement,
14       that's what she used to -- as a method for quitting for
15       several months.  She had been smoking in '86 roughly 11
16       years.
17             And at the conclusion of this time, you know, that
18       was the assistance she used, you can see right here,
19       for -- to quit for several months.
20             That's right, was her response.
21             And then she was asked:  You never gave that book
22       to your mother, right?
23             She said:  Correct.
24             Instead you gave it to your father-in-law?
25             Now, don't you think -- this is exactly what I was

 1       saying earlier.  If it weren't a recognition or a belief
 2       by people who loved her that she wanted to continue
 3       smoking, don't you think that book would have gone to
 4       her, rather than her father-in-law, or she would have
 5       gotten another copy of it or something?  But there is no
 6       indication here that anything of that sort occurred.
 7             Next slide, please.  And after that, what happens,
 8       after she's quit for several months, I know we talked
 9       about this in the opening, she asked her mother for a
10       cigarette.  And knowing that she's quit for several
11       months, and without resistance, without comment, without
12       anything, Ms. Miller gives her a cigarette.
13             And she acknowledges here, this is Michelle
14       Mrozek:  Was that the cigarette that returned you to
15       smoking, the one that your mother gave you without
16       resistance?
17             The answer is:  Yes. 18             So, again, if you are a person who wants to quit
19       smoking, who believes that this is something that you
20       want to put out of your life, I would submit to you,
21       number one, you would never give it without -- to -- to
22       begin with, to your eldest child, that -- that product,
23       as occurred here, in 1975.
24             More than that, in 1986 when that child has quit
25       for a period of time and comes to you and you know that

 1       person that -- that person that you love has quit and
 2       asks for a cigarette, you wouldn't just hand one over if
 3       this person's mindset were as has been depicted, I would
 4       submit, by the plaintiff in this case.
 5             Next slide.  Now, I'd like to talk briefly about
 6       the wedding in '87, that -- up in Georgia.  And,
 7       obviously, we've talked about that a good bit in the
 8       testimony.  This was the wedding up in Atlanta that
 9       you've seen pictures and heard about where Ms. Miller
10       quit for two weeks and her only indication was showers,
11       parties, you name it, she hadn't smoked.
12             And then at the end of the event, we see a picture
13       of her opposite her daughter, Michelle, both of them are
14       sharing cigarettes, apparently from the same pack at the
15       same table.
16             And we're asking Carol Gibson about this and she
17       acknowledges that during the time frame that she was up
18       there, they did a variety of things, you never observed
19       her smoking?
20             I did not.
21             And then she told you in that time frame that she
22       had quit?
23             She obviously had.
24             Next slide.  Goes on.  You didn't have con- -- but
25       you did have contact with her the night before?

 1             This is from Ralph Gibson.  And this is the
 2       rehearsal dinner.  And he points out and acknowledges
 3       that she went the whole evening in this house where they
 4       didn't allow smoking and his sister-in-law wasn't
 5       smoking.
 6             The point being, again, you know, she's at the
 7       wedding, she's having a good time.  And I asked
 8       Mr. Gibson about it because he -- this is a fellow, like
 9       we've said and like you know, is an ardent antismoker.
10       And what's he do at -- at his wedding reception?  He and
11       his wife, Carol, allow people to smoke there.
12             And when I asked him about it, he said, Well,
13       because I have friends who smoke, who make the adult
14       decision.  They're entitled to do it, it's part of their
15       enjoyment.  You know, basically, he may not like it, but
16       they do and he understands that.
17             And that, obviously, from the footage that you've
18       seen of that wedding, it seemed apparent that back in a
19       social setting, back with family, whom she loved, some 20       of whom smoked with her, that was only impetus that
21       Ms. Miller needed to resume smoking at that time.
22             And, again, I would submit that's not really
23       reflective of someone who has a -- a strong commitment
24       or motivation to want to -- to want to remain quit.
25       Because, I mean, there wasn't -- the testimony was there

 1       wasn't anything that indicates that she was in any
 2       distress or having withdrawal or anything of the sort
 3       during that two-week period.
 4             Next -- next document.  Now, finishing out the
 5       '80s.  '88, Ms. Miller moves to Delray Beach and it's
 6       significant there because at that time frame, '88, '89,
 7       somewhere in there, she stopped smoking Lorillard
 8       cigarettes forever.  That's it.  Thereafter, every
 9       cigarette that she smokes, for whatever reason, is a
10       brand that is made by a company other than Lorillard.
11             Next slide, please.  Okay.  And here there's a
12       confirmation of that very fact from Ms. Mrozek,
13       indicating that Carltons, Misty, Capri, Benson & Hedges,
14       all those are brands that her mother smoked from the
15       late '80s until her death and that none of those
16       cigarettes were made by the Lorillard Tobacco
17       Company.
18             Next slide, please.  Regulations again.  More and
19       greater regulation from the government in terms of what
20       we were required to do at that time, including providing
21       a list of ingredients to the government.  That's some 25
22       years ago.
23             Next slide.  Now, in the final four years of
24       Ms. Miller's life, in my timeline, which I'm close to
25       getting to the end of, Malia Torgensen quits smoking.

 1       She, like so many others that are close to Jackie
 2       Miller, became motivated in her case just like
 3       Ms. Gibson.  She was motivated by the impending marriage
 4       to Curt Torgensen.  And quit roughly a year before her
 5       marriage.  And she said it was hard, but she was
 6       motivated.  And she followed it through and hasn't
 7       smoked since.  As you can see here, she was married in
 8       1991.
 9             Ms. Miller moves back from Delray Beach in 1992,
10       buys the first home that she's owned, you know -- you
11       know, since -- since she had her first marriage.  And,
12       unfortunately, her health, which you've heard from a
13       variety of people from the witness stand, beginning with
14       her son, Robert, referencing a smoker's cough in the
15       '70s and then through testimony of -- of Tricia Miller
16       and -- and Carol Gibson and Ralph Gibson, her health in
17       the 1980s, obviously, she had experienced a number of
18       problems during that time.
19             From shortness of breath, smoker's cough,
20       bronchitis, emphysema, she's testified about all of
21       those things, you've heard the evidence, you've heard 22       from -- from her family in terms of the experiences
23       and -- and difficulties that she had in that regard in
24       the years that precede this time frame.  Including the
25       testimony from Carol Gibson and Ralph Gibson to the

 1       effect that she couldn't walk more than a city block in
 2       the latter part of the 18- -- 1980s and early '90s
 3       because of difficulties with her shortness of breath.
 4             Now, diagnosis is, you know, in November '94
 5       and a very short period of time that she lives,
 6       unfortunately.
 7             But before she passed, I wanted to take just a
 8       minute and touch upon the testimony that you heard
 9       yesterday from Mr. Cuchetti.  Mr. Cuchetti, as you heard
10       from Tricia Miller earlier, is a longtime friend of
11       hers, and as you saw in the videos, he was the fellow --
12       one of the fellows who was the singer selected by
13       Ms. Miller at Malia Torgensen's wedding on the boat.
14             And Ms. Miller ran into him at a store, the two of
15       them went over together the first time and saw Jackie
16       Miller after she was diagnosed.  And the testimony was
17       to the effect that he went over there, as a volunteer,
18       to sing to her.  He knew her, he went there without pay
19       to comfort her and entertain her and he did just that.
20             In the course of going there, he learned that --
21       of this song that was her favorite song and, ultimately,
22       she asked him to sing that for her at her wedding.
23             And the only reason that I brought that up is
24       because, you know, if you're looking for insight into
25       what makes a person tick, okay, what makes them go, what

 1       they're about, one of the things is music.  And in
 2       particular, music that you might select when you're --
 3       when it's your last opportunity to say anything about
 4       yourself.
 5             And, you know, this was her favorite song, the ly-
 6       -- the lyrics are poignant because, as you'll recall,
 7       they're about someone looking back on their life right
 8       at the end.  And this is the song that she selected and
 9       he performed for her in a -- at her funeral, after
10       having sung for her privately a couple of times.
11             And the only -- the reason I brought that up,
12       obviously, is it seemed to me absolutely 100 percent
13       consistent to the picture that the evidence presents
14       here about how Ms. Miller lived her life and why she
15       lived it the way she did.
16             She -- you know, she indicated, I believe, through
17       that selection, that as the words say, she had no
18       regrets.  She lived her life her way.  She made the
19       decisions about her life that she wanted to make about
20       her life and that's the reason I would submit, perhaps,
21       that she selected it.
22             So the -- what I'd like to do now that I'm
23       finished with my -- and I apologize for length of it, 24       but it's a lot of time that we went through, my
25       timeline, I'd like to turn very quickly to the verdict

 1       form in this case.
 2             THE CLERK:  30 minutes.
 3             MR. MOLONY:  How much?
 4             THE CLERK:  30 minutes.
 5             MR. MOLONY:  30 minutes.  Okay.  I'll move
 6       quickly.
 7             Here's the verdict form.  You'll get a chance to
 8       see it.  There's three questions here.  The first page
 9       of it that we're going to be talking about, each of them
10       requires a determination on the issue of legal cause.
11       Both with regard to negligence, defect and unreasonably
12       dangerous cigarettes question.
13             And the third question, obviously, requires proof
14       of legal cause as well.  We've touched upon that and I'm
15       going to spend -- kind of move through this quickly
16       because I'm running out of time.
17             As you know, the -- next slide -- this is what you
18       have to -- plaintiff has to establish in order for there
19       to be a legal cause.  Direct connection, a substantial
20       impact.
21             Next slide, first question on the verdict form is
22       as you see.  You'll get a chance to review it in the
23       jury room quite obviously.  It makes the -- it imposes
24       the requirement of the finding of legal cause there.
25             Keep going please.  And the instructions that

 1       you'll be provided by the court, again, requires direct
 2       and substantial -- direct connection, substantial
 3       impact.  You see the language there and you see the but
 4       for language as well.
 5             Next slide.  And here you have the acknowledgment
 6       from Ms. Mrozek that her mother was negligent in her
 7       efforts to quit smoking and that was a partial legal
 8       cause of her death.
 9             Next slide.  The -- in -- in this particular --
10       and let me address these two very quickly.  The
11       negligence issue, there has been no proof here that
12       connects any alleged wrongful conduct by Lorillard
13       Tobacco Company with Ms. Miller.  They have not
14       connected the dots on the issue of negligence.
15             You have the findings.  The findings say, and
16       you'll have them with you, and you've already heard it,
17       Notwithstanding the above findings, which are binding on
18       you in the court, the liability of Lorillard to the
19       estate of Jacqueline Miller must still be proved by the
20       plaintiff in accord with the instructions I will give
21       you hereafter on each specific claim.
22             So negligence and design -- let's go back one.
23       No.  Go back to the -- to the negligence question,
24       please.
25             MS. VOUGHT:  Which one? 4046
 1             MR. MOLONY:  All right.  Negligence question,
 2       please.  Okay.  They have to prove that something
 3       Lorillard did or failed to do constituted negligence and
 4       it was a legal cause of Ms. Miller's death.  I submit to
 5       you there has been no evidence of anything that
 6       Lorillard did or failed to do that provides a direct
 7       connection and a substantial impact on Ms. Miller.  I
 8       don't know of what the -- what the alleged negligence
 9       is.  I dare say, I don't think anyone knows what that --
10       that --
11             MR. PATACCA:  Object, Your Honor.  That's
12       improper.
13             THE COURT:  Just wait just one second.  Just wait.
14       The first part is in -- part of your comment is not
15       correct.
16             MR. MOLONY:  Okay.  The --
17             THE COURT:  The part -- you wish me to be
18       specific?  The part about them having to prove
19       negligence.
20             MR. MOLONY:  No, what I'm -- what they have to do
21       is connect -- they have to find negligence and the
22       plaintiff has to prove a connection between that
23       negligence and the decedent.  That's what they haven't
24       done.  They have not connected the dots.
25             Likewise, second half of the test on legal cause

 1       but for.  The evidence is clear that -- just look at
 2       what her smoking history was.  Is there anyone here who
 3       thinks she would not have smoked if there weren't
 4       Lorillard Tobacco products for her to purchase?
 5             There isn't any -- I -- I would submit to you, if
 6       you apply your common sense, it's plain, all you need to
 7       do is look at what she smoked from '88 thereafter, she
 8       smoked other brands.  There wasn't anything particularly
 9       magic about anything Lorillard did.
10             Next.  Were the defective and unreasonably
11       dangerous cigarettes placed on the market by Lorillard a
12       legal cause?  Again, here's the legal cause concept.
13       What they have to do is make a connection through proof
14       between something that is defective and unreasonably
15       dangerous about these cigarettes.
16             It can't be the fact that they caused illness
17       because all tobacco does that.  It can't be because they
18       have nicotine in it because it becomes naturally in the
19       cigarette.  It has to be something specific to the
20       Lorillard cigarettes and -- and that -- that had an
21       impact that they've proven and shown in order to satisfy
22       this requirement here.
23             And -- and on the -- on the requirement of legal
24       cause, plus not only that, we have the issue of but for.
25       And, again, in a -- it's plain, that Ms. Miller would

 1       have smoked other brands, as she did, even if the  2       Lorillard cigarettes were not in the picture.
 3             Next slide, please.  Here's the definition of what
 4       a defective product is.  And, again, the highlighted
 5       language goes back to what I've been talking about, you
 6       know, as we've gone through here today and in my
 7       opening.
 8             Next slide.  Verdict form.  Was Lorillard's
 9       Tobacco Company concealment or omission of material
10       information about the health effects or addictive nature
11       of smoking cigarettes, or both, a legal cause of
12       Jacqueline Swann Miller's death?
13             These two questions are the same.  These two
14       questions both require legal cause.  These two questions
15       both require connecting the dots with proof that
16       something that was withheld or concealed from her had an
17       impact on her.  That's the obligation there.
18             Otherwise, the findings would impose liability and
19       we wouldn't need to be here in the first instance.  They
20       have a proof obligation on both of these.  And I submit
21       to you, they plainly have not met it.
22             Likewise, again, the -- the issue of the but for.
23       That's consistent throughout all this and demonstrates
24       why it is that there wasn't anything significant or --
25       or particular to Lorillard or its behavior that had any

 1       impact on Ms. Miller.
 2             Next slide.  Defines material facts.  You have an
 3       opportunity to read this in the jury room.
 4             Next slide.  Importantly, on the -- on the issue
 5       of concealment, testimony of their evidence of reliance.
 6       Every single witness that came to the stand we posed
 7       these questions to about the Tobacco Industry Research
 8       Committee, about comments from the Council for Tobacco
 9       Research, anything.
10             Did anyone have a conversation with Ms. Miller
11       about the information she might have received, any
12       information she might have received from Lorillard
13       Tobacco Company?
14             We didn't have any conversations about that.
15             Consistent.  There's no evidence in that regard.
16             Next slide.  Same here.  Frank Statement, no
17       mess- -- no conversation about that.  Hill & Knowlton,
18       no conversation about that.
19             And, finally, I'm -- well, it says, I'm asking:
20       Did you ever have a conversation with her where she said
21       information was kept from me about smoking by a tobacco
22       company, whether it's Lorillard or any of the other
23       manufacturers?
24             I don't recall a conversation like that.
25             Next slide, please.  Allocation of responsibility

 1       of fault.  I've already told you -- we've gone through
 2       control, causation, and even more importantly than that,
 3       I -- I've described for you my -- my suggestion as to  4       why Ms. Miller did what she did in this regard with
 5       respect to her smoking.  And why that her loved ones not
 6       say anything to about it -- to her about it.
 7             And that plainly suggests that my view is that she
 8       didn't want to quit smoking.  She may have wanted to
 9       quit -- cut back for a time, but, plainly, she not only
10       didn't want to quit smoking, her children and loved ones
11       accepted that decision and respected that decision from
12       her.
13             And so, you know, from my perspective, the person
14       who is in control should receive all of the
15       responsibility there.  If you disagree with that in any
16       respect, obviously, it's ultimately your decision and
17       not mine.
18             But I would submit to you that this is a lady that
19       was smart, independent, wasn't led around, she made up
20       her own mind and -- and chartered her own path through
21       life, including on the issue of smoking.
22             Next slide, please.  The verdict form talks about
23       damages.  And you'll see three questions like this right
24       here.  One for each of her three children.  Ms. Michelle
25       Mrozek, who's the plaintiff, her son, Robert, and her

 1       daughter, Malia.  And I'll just read one of them.
 2             What is the total amount of any damages sustained
 3       by Michelle Mrozek for the loss of parental
 4       companionship, instruction and guidance and Michelle
 5       Mrozek's pain and suffering as a result of Jacqueline
 6       Swann Miller's injury and death?
 7             That's a tough subject.  How -- how do you
 8       value -- you can't -- how do value if you think that
 9       there is liability here?  How do you value the loss of a
10       parent regardless of age?  It's a tough thing.  It's a
11       tough thing to talk about.  It's a tough thing, in
12       particular, for a defense lawyer like myself, when, you
13       know, your contention is that nothing -- you know, that
14       there should not be compensation here because the family
15       apparently accepted her decision not to -- not to try to
16       quit smoking, to have acquiesced in her decision and not
17       ever said anything to her about it, which was their
18       right to do so, to respect that decision.  But that
19       said, I would not be doing my job if I didn't make a
20       suggestion to you in this regard.
21             You've heard about the mortality tables, they
22       reflect 19.9 years.  And that's presuming a healthy
23       person.  There's testimony that Ms. Miller, apart from
24       her breathing problems, she also -- her sister testified
25       that she had skin cancer and there was also bleeding

 1       ulcers that Ms. Miller testified about.  Both of which
 2       might, in your judgment, impact the mortality with
 3       respect to the life expectancy of Ms. Miller and
 4       whether that's -- whether 20 years is -- is appropriate
 5       under the circumstances.  Again, that's entirely up to  6       you.
 7             But as a suggestion, what I would like to suggest
 8       is that for each year, if you conclude that my client
 9       was liable, that you consider awarding damages to each
10       of the three of them for each year that you think that
11       Ms. Miller would, otherwise, have lived in the amount of
12       $10,000 per person.
13             So, roughly, in the event that you conclude that
14       we are responsible, notwithstanding the things that I've
15       suggested, then I would sug- -- would suggest that to
16       you as a consideration of another possible way of
17       dealing with the valuation of a very difficult subject.
18             Next slide.  You -- you'll be able to read this in
19       the jury room.
20             Next slide, please.  And, again, we have three of
21       these and this -- and this is understandable given the
22       description that I've given in terms of the apparent
23       acceptance by the family of her decision not to try and
24       quit smoking.  This is from Michelle Mrozek.
25             Next slide.  Here's Robert acknowledging that they

 1       never encouraged her -- his mother to quit smoking.
 2             Next slide.  Here's Malia Torgensen saying
 3       predictably the same thing.
 4             Next slide.
 5             THE CLERK:  Ten minutes.
 6             MR. MOLONY:  Thank you.
 7             Punitive damages.  Now, punitive damages is a
 8       different type of subject.  Compensatory damages, which
 9       is what we were just talking about, is for the purpose
10       of fully compensating someone if you determine that
11       there is liability for a loss.  That's what compensatory
12       damages are about.  That's what I was talking about in
13       terms of the loss of parental guidance, companionship
14       and so forth that we just reviewed.
15             Punitive damages are something different.  The
16       purpose of punitive damages is -- is, as the name
17       suggests, is to punish.  And it's additional money
18       that -- if you were to decide to award punitive damages,
19       it would be additional money that would go to the
20       plaintiffs.
21             Some people have the misconception that they --
22       punitive damages go somewhere else.  They don't.  They
23       go to the -- the persons who are bringing the claim, if
24       you collectively were to decide that they were owed.
25             And they're determined not in this proceeding.

 1       They would be determined in a second proceeding or later
 2       proceeding in this case.  The -- the only issue you'll
 3       see on your verdict form is whether or not there is an
 4       entitlement, not an amount having to do with the
 5       punitive damages issue in this case.
 6             And if the -- the issue of punitive damages is you
 7       can only consider with regard to punitive damages harm  8       that -- conduct that resulted in harm directly to the
 9       plaintiff or to her mother, Jackie Miller.  Can't be
10       harm to anyone else, which is logical, because,
11       basically, if there is -- if -- if the purpose of
12       punitive damages is to punish and to persuade, and it is
13       from future inapp- -- inappropriate conduct, then it can
14       only be as it relates to the person who was the injured
15       party in your case.
16             Now, the ads that have been featured prominently
17       here for the reasons I've already ex- -- explained,
18       number one, Ms. Miller didn't purchase any cigarettes
19       based upon ads.  Number two, those ad campaigns, with
20       the exception -- and it's not an ad, every ad campaign
21       for Kent failed.  Every ad campaign for Max failed.
22             So the only success that my client ever had with
23       regard to its Kent product was through the good fortune
24       of having come up with something that was embraced by
25       the Reader's Digest folks.

 1             The findings -- well, here the standard is
 2       different as well.  It's greater weight of the evidence
 3       as far as everything in the case up to the point of
 4       punitive -- punitive damages timing.  The standard here
 5       is clear and convincing evidence.
 6             And what that means, that's defined as evidence
 7       that is precise, explicit, lacking in confusion and of
 8       such weight that it produces a firm belief or conviction
 9       without hesitation about the matter at issue as it
10       relates in this case to Jackie Miller.
11             I suggest if you look closely at the evidence in
12       this case, there is no conduct that satisfies that
13       standard that relates to my client.  I dare say and I
14       thought about this, was thinking about this last night,
15       and the more I thought about it, the more I considered
16       the -- Jackie Miller's smoking history and the fact that
17       there was never any suggestion from any family members
18       or loved ones that she quit and the fact that she gave
19       very few indications of ever wanting to quit smoking,
20       that the most compelling evidence on any particular
21       subject in this case is that it does not appear that
22       Jackie Miller ever really wanted to quit smoking.
23             And I think that's the strongest evidence that is
24       in this record.  And I think that plainly that there is
25       no evidence here, for all the reasons that I've

 1       expressed already, that reaches the standard of clear
 2       and convincing evidence.
 3             And, therefore, I would encourage you that based
 4       upon the record that's in front of you, that there is no
 5       basis for determining that there is an entitlement to
 6       punitive damages being awarded against my client in this
 7       case.
 8             In conclusion, you-all know that Jackie Miller, by
 9       all accounts, lived life on her own terms.  She was an 10       independent, intelligent, capable woman who was
11       described by her children as a person who -- I think
12       Robert put it as along the lines of live and let live or
13       words to that effect.
14             Tricia Miller testified about how when they would
15       have a problem or an issue, she would take it to her
16       mother-in-law and she would tell them the good and the
17       bad and whatever problem was -- it was that was
18       confronting them and then she let them make their own
19       decision.  She would let them decide for themselves in
20       what direction they would ta- -- go in their life.  And
21       I think that is illustrative of the type of person she
22       was, both in dealing with them and in dealing with her
23       own life.
24             She saw, I would submit, and the -- the family saw
25       smoking as an adult choice and one that she had a right

 1       to make.  All the pictures show, I would submit, that
 2       she enjoyed smoking and never really gave any strong
 3       indication that she had a motivation to quit smoking.
 4             And as the experts for the plaintiff came in here
 5       and said, at all times, in every year she smoked, she
 6       had the ability to quit smoking if she were properly
 7       motivated to do so.  And the evidence is to the effect
 8       that she wasn't.  The fact that came from her dear
 9       friend, Louise Fink, she said I never really saw
10       anything that indicated that Jackie wanted to quit and
11       that's in her testimony.
12             THE CLERK:  Ten minutes.
13             MR. MOLONY:  Ladies and gentlemen, you've been
14       very attentive.  I appreciate that attention.  I
15       appreciate you spending this time with me and -- and
16       paying such close attention to the facts and the
17       evidence that is in this case.  I have every confidence
18       that when you collectively get together and decide it,
19       it'll be based on the laws as the court provides, it'll
20       be based on the evidence that has come in from the
21       witness stand and that you'll utilize your common sense
22       in sorting through that in deciding what is -- what is
23       the truth in this case and whether or not there is
24       entitlement to recovery by the plaintiff in this cause.
25             Again, on behalf of the Lorillard Tobacco Company

 1       and my partners, I thank you very much for your time
 2       away from your family and your work and for your -- your
 3       assistance in -- in -- in helping the parties bring this
 4       case to a conclusion.
 5             Thank you.
