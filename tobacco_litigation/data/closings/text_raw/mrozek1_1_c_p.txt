 2            MR. PATACCA:  -- counsel, and members of the
 3       jury.
 4            Let me start with thanking each and every one
 5       of you for giving us three weeks.  Without all of
 6       the time and the attention that you've given us out
 7       of your lives, none of us in this room could be at
 8       this point here today.
 9            We need the jury system.  We need jurors who
10       are judges of the facts to consider important
11       matters between the parties.  Let me just say on
12       behalf of everyone in this courtroom, this is a very
13       important case for both sides.  We know you have
14       paid extremely close attention.  We've noticed.
15       You've been very prompt every day.  You've stayed
16       without any complaints.  And we do thank you for
17       that.
18            And I'd like to ask you to give us a little
19       indulgence this morning as we finish with our
20       closing arguments so that we can give you an idea of
21       what we think came into evidence, how you should
22       view the evidence and render a verdict in this case,
23       and then the case will be yours this afternoon.
24            So, again, thank you on behalf of the plaintiff
25       and my partners, Evan Yegelwel and Bruce Anderson,

 1       but also our assistant, Ms. White, who you've seen
 2       in here this morning, Mr. Keller and Ms. Chaney,
 3       who's also helping me, because no one could get this
 4       case here without that help, so I thank them.
 5            And I know Lorillard equally thanks you for
 6       being here, and I'll let Mr. Molony address that.
 7       But on behalf of all of us here in the court system,
 8       we do really appreciate your service.
 9            So let me wrap up and get going this morning,
10       if you don't mind.
11            We kind of started this case unofficially in
12       voir dire when we were picking jurors in this case,
13       but Mr. Anderson kicked it off for us officially --
14       I think it was on Valentine's Day.  Perhaps you
15       might have been here on the 14th.
16            And we submitted to you we thought the evidence
17       was going to show that in this case between these
18       parties what was going to be important is for you to
19       ask three questions throughout the case:  What did
20       they know, when did they know it, and what did they
21       do with what they knew?
22            And Mr. Anderson didn't just say this would be
23       important for just what Lorillard knew and when and
24       what did they do, but with Jackie Miller, too.
25            Those three questions, I would submit, could

 1       guide you as you considered all the evidence in the
 2       past two weeks and will hopefully guide you in the 3       closing argument when you evaluate the parties here.
 4            As Mr. Anderson told you, also, what we would
 5       like to have you consider and what we thought would
 6       be appropriate throughout all the evidence in this
 7       case is to compare and measure.  Compare what Jackie
 8       Miller knew with what Lorillard knew.  Compare when
 9       Jackie Miller knew what she learned with what
10       Lorillard knew and when they knew it.  Compare what
11       Jackie Miller did with the information when she
12       learned it with what Lorillard did with the
13       information when they learned it.
14            From the very beginning of this case, and
15       unofficially even when we were talking in voir dire,
16       you remember a lot of the questions we even got to
17       every juror is not withstanding whatever you've done
18       in your personal life, your experiences, your
19       viewpoints, can you set aside all of that, listen to
20       only the evidence that came in through the stand or
21       videos and the instructions that Judge Soud will be
22       reading you at the end, the law that you must
23       follow?  Can you set that aside and compare
24       individual responsibility with corporate
25       responsibility?

 1            And if I recall, I believe we had that
 2       conversation with almost everybody who is on this
 3       jury here and certainly scores of others who were on
 4       the prospective jury.  That was one of the most
 5       important parts, because we needed jurors to come in
 6       with the scales balanced; nobody had a step ahead
 7       and nobody was behind.
 8            And every juror -- 150 people were summoned in
 9       Courtroom A -- all raised their hand -- now, we
10       didn't talk to maybe the last 30, but everybody
11       raised their hand under oath and said, I can do
12       that.  I can evaluate this case fairly.
13            And when we talked about who could really put
14       aside previous notions, we got to nine, nine people
15       who swore under oath to Judge Arnold, a circuit
16       court judge in the State of Florida here in Duval
17       County, and brought that with them to Judge Soud and
18       said, I will set aside any personal beliefs I have
19       about smokers, about smoking, about companies, about
20       the issues.  I promise I won't listen to the radio
21       on tobacco, I won't read newspaper accounts.  I'm
22       going to put that all aside, and I swear under oath,
23       just like every witness who came into this court
24       with a hand on the Bible, I swear or affirm that I
25       can do that.

 1            And that is why, from 150 people who were
 2       summoned over basically a month ago, we have nine.
 3       All of you indicated you could put that aside and
 4       measure and compare Jackie's fault and consider it 5       with Lorillard Tobacco's fault, compare
 6       responsibilities.
 7            You know, we came into court from the very
 8       beginning, and again back in voir dire when we were
 9       asking the questions, and said, Guess what?  You'll
10       never hear us say that Jackie Miller was not
11       partially at fault.  She was.  Right out of the
12       gate, right up front.  She was partially at fault.
13       Because at some point she probably knew that smoking
14       became dangerous.  At some point, even though she
15       was addicted and had a disease that undermined her
16       ability to quit, at some point she should have tried
17       harder.
18            And I'll talk to you a little bit more about
19       that this morning, and I would submit that that was
20       probably in the '80s, as you heard testimony about
21       friends who were quitting around that time, family
22       members.  The defense wanted you to believe -- to
23       hear everything that everybody else knew and impute
24       it to her.
25            Well, at some point the message probably got

 1       through, but it had to get through the disease.  But
 2       nonetheless, Mr. Anderson told you you will not hear
 3       us say that Jackie Miller was not partially at fault
 4       for her injuries.
 5            What didn't you hear?  You never heard
 6       Lorillard say, Well, we're partially at fault, too,
 7       and let's just compare and measure.  With Lorillard
 8       it has been either/or.  She was at fault, not us.
 9            I expect you're going to hear this morning
10       enjoyment.  It's either enjoyment or addiction.
11       Either she was at fault or nobody was at fault.
12            We told you up front we are partially at fault,
13       we accept that responsibility, and we would ask you
14       to use the oath that you gave us to say, I will
15       fairly judge this case on the evidence and compare
16       and measure the fault of both of them.
17            Ms. Chaney, can you put up P Number 2?
18            I expect His Honor is going to instruct you as
19       to the findings as he did initially early on.  There
20       are certain findings that in this courtroom are
21       binding on all of us; His Honor, the parties, and,
22       yes, the nine members of the jury who swore to
23       follow the law.  This is the law.
24            One of the findings that everyone is bound by
25       is that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, small

 1       cell carcinoma, the very cancer that Jackie Miller
 2       got and died from in 1994.  No dispute.  No one's
 3       allowed to dispute it.  That's the law.
 4            If someone were to dispute it, it would be no
 5       different than driving down Bay Street in front of
 6       the courthouse and running the red light.  JSO would 7       have pulled them over.  So if anybody would ever
 8       suggest, and they will not, that you could ignore
 9       that finding, that would be running the red light.
10       That would be ignoring the law.  It would be
11       ignoring the oath, your duty.
12            P Number 3, please.
13            That nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.  No
14       question.  The finding was made.  The judge is
15       bound, we are bound, Lorillard is bound, and you are
16       bound.  And, really, there was no question, as we'll
17       talk about the testimony you heard.
18            P Number 4.
19            Lorillard was found negligent.  I expect His
20       Honor is going to discuss with you what negligence
21       means, but negligence is the failure to use
22       reasonable care.  But Lorillard was negligent.  The
23       judge is bound by that, we are bound by that,
24       Lorillard is bound by that, and you, the nine
25       members of our jury, under your oath, will be bound

 1       by that, and we know you will.
 2            And that's why we say, as you go forward, you
 3       need to measure their fault with Jackie's fault.
 4       Compare and measure what did they know, when did
 5       they know it, what did they do with what they knew,
 6       and compare it to her with those very same three
 7       questions.
 8            P5, please.
 9            Lorillard placed cigarettes on the market that
10       were defective and unreasonably dangerous.  Their
11       cigarettes were defective and they were unreasonably
12       dangerous.  Everyone in this courtroom is bound by
13       that.  Jackie Miller smoked Lorillard Tobacco
14       cigarettes that were defective and unreasonably
15       dangerous.  And you cannot run the red light and
16       ignore that fact.
17            P Number 6.
18            Lorillard concealed or omitted material
19       information that otherwise -- not otherwise known or
20       available, knowing that the material was false or
21       misleading or failed to disclose a material fact
22       concerning the health effects or addictive nature of
23       smoking cigarettes or both.
24            There can't be any dispute.  Members of the
25       jury, expect when His Honor reads you the law in

 1       this case -- eventually you will have a copy of
 2       this, so you will see these very findings typed down
 3       for you.  And I know you -- because you've all been
 4       excellent about taking notes.  Keep doing so, but I
 5       want you to know you will have these when you go
 6       back to the jury room.
 7            They concealed and omitted material
 8       information.  And His Honor is going to instruct you 9       as to what material means, but I would submit
10       material information is information a person would
11       want to know so that they can take precautions, so
12       they can protect themselves; important information,
13       material information.
14            Jurors understand material because we all bring
15       into this courtroom common sense.  We all deal with
16       material information.  If you want to buy a house,
17       some things are material and some are not.  In that
18       context, you know what is important to you in making
19       a decision to buy a house.
20            When a person buys a product, they know in the
21       context or hope to know what might be important to
22       them.  And where we get into trouble is when you
23       have no idea what is in the product and they conceal
24       it and omit it, when they knew it.  Material.
25            Not otherwise known.  What did they know?  When

 1       did they know it?  What did they do with the
 2       information?  You heard a lot of testimony from
 3       Dr. Robinson, you may recall, the corporate
 4       representative, and I'll talk more about him.  But
 5       can it be seriously argued in this courtroom in
 6       2011, even knowing what people know in 2011, that
 7       Jackie Miller had the same information available to
 8       her that all the scientists in Greensboro, North
 9       Carolina, at Lorillard knew?
10            Can it honestly be debated that she was aware
11       of all the information that they had in that private
12       library, the library that they didn't even share
13       with one of their witnesses they brought to you
14       yesterday?
15            She didn't know.  She couldn't have known.
16       We'll talk a little bit more about that this
17       morning.
18            P Number 7, please.
19            Lorillard agreed to conceal or omit the
20       information regarding the health effects of
21       cigarettes or their addictive nature with the
22       intention that smokers and the public would rely on
23       the information to their detriment.
24            No running red lights.  The Court, the parties
25       and this jury is bound by that.  Lorillard was found

 1       to have agreed with others to conceal and omit the
 2       information about the dangers or the health effects
 3       of cigarettes and the addictive nature of the
 4       cigarettes with the intention -- intent that people
 5       rely.
 6            And I would submit as I talk to you this
 7       morning that's exactly what happened.  What happened
 8       was what they intended to happen.  Withhold, omit,
 9       people will buy.  People will rely.
10            Interesting we had at the beginning of this 11       case opening statements by Mr. Anderson and
12       Mr. Molony.  And -- I'm okay with the lights.  Thank
13       you.
14            Mr. Molony -- and you go by your memory.  This,
15       again, just the attorneys telling you what they
16       thought you would hear in the evidence.  But he made
17       the statement in front of this jury in this
18       courtroom, and he warned you.  He said, You are
19       going to hear things from documents and things we
20       said over the decades that we would never say today,
21       things that we would never say today.
22            He called them wrong-headed.  He called them
23       absurd.  He suggested they were out of context.  But
24       I would submit, as we talked earlier this morning,
25       that right there by Lorillard is an admission that,

 1       What we did over the past 50 years was wrong.
 2            You would never do that today.  It's
 3       reprehensible.  It's negligent.  It disregards the
 4       safety of others.  It's consciously indifferent.  It
 5       shows a lack of care.  Never do it.
 6            And then he mentioned, and I'm sure you heard
 7       it, but I'm not apologizing for it, that's why we're
 8       here today.  In 2011, 65 years after the 1954 Frank
 9       Statement, their Declaration of Independence, if you
10       will, where the tobacco companies signed on and
11       said, We stand together or we'll surely fall apart,
12       that started what we believe and ask you to consider
13       is a conspiracy in the industry to omit and conceal.
14            Back in December of 1953, you heard from
15       Dr. Robinson, it was Christmas, the holidays.  It
16       was a time when most people are putting business
17       aside, the holidays, the end of the year.  You
18       gather family, you give thanks for a great year, you
19       come together and you relax.
20            What you've heard was that Lorillard and the
21       other tobacco companies from which it agreed, they
22       gathered in New York at The Plaza Hotel during the
23       Christmas holidays.  They gathered because there was
24       a cancer scare.
25            And I'm not talking about the cancer scare

 1       where the mice studies were being given out to the
 2       public.  Surely that was going on.  The cancer scare
 3       was that the information was going to the public and
 4       they were concerned that the people were going to
 5       stop smoking; people were going to stop buying their
 6       cigarettes; people would stop handing over their
 7       money to get a cigarette and continue to smoke it.
 8            That was the scare that was going on in 1953.
 9       Instead of going home with their families and
10       thanking themselves for what a great year it's been
11       like every other American does during the holidays,
12       they gathered together their top executives and 13       their PR company, not one scientist, and said, What
14       are we going to do about it?  And they signed the
15       Frank Statement.
16            We're going to issue a statement to America in
17       over 400 newspapers that will be widely circulated
18       over tens and hundreds of thousands and tell the
19       American public, We are interested in your health.
20       We are not aware of anything in anything in our
21       cigarettes that is harmful.  And if we find it, we
22       will remove it.  And we will set forth research to
23       make sure we know what's in the cigarettes.
24            They took on that duty.  They declared that to
25       the American public.  They signed the document

 1       together.  That's what they did.
 2            And I'll talk to you in a minute about
 3       Dr. Burns, how he views what they did over the past
 4       50 years.  Things you would never do today.  Things
 5       you would never say today.  Things that are
 6       reprehensible when you're talking about, as
 7       Dr. Roberts, their historian, the greatest health
 8       issue of the twentieth century.
 9            When they signed that document and published it
10       in the paper and said, We don't know of anything in
11       our cigarettes that's harmful, you learned in these
12       past two weeks that wasn't true.  They've always
13       known.  There was scientific literature already
14       associating with lung cancer, with death and cancer.
15       They knew about the nicotine properties even back
16       then.  They knew that people compensated when they
17       switched types of cigarettes.  Some people would
18       smoke more to get more nicotine and tar.
19            They knew that and yet represented to the
20       American public, We're not aware, but if we are or
21       if we become aware, we're going to fix it.  That was
22       their Frank Statement.  And two weeks ago you heard
23       their next Frank Statement:  We would never say it,
24       but I'm not apologizing for it.  Can't get more
25       frank than that.

 1            So over the past 50 and 60 years, what have
 2       they done?  Lorillard has marketed cigarettes,
 3       marketed it to the public, marketed it to consumers.
 4       They've spent millions, and in fact you heard from
 5       Ms. Leung over a billion dollars in the history of
 6       Lorillard marketing these doses of nicotine.
 7            Now, you couldn't devise a better marketing
 8       plan than Lorillard had.  I mean, they really -- as
 9       you've seen it, they epitomize how you get a
10       consumer to take the product, how do you get them
11       hooked, and how do you keep them on the products.
12       It was masterful.
13            I think you heard in some of the testimony that
14       was going on with Dr. Robinson -- you may recall 15       Dr. Robinson's PowerPoint 8.
16            We don't need the lights off.
17            You will remember he was the first witness you
18       heard from.  He was their corporate representative.
19       We told you we were going to bring witnesses.  We
20       made him sit down under oath, their representative,
21       and tell us about research and development over the
22       years.  And a jury in North Florida heard that
23       testimony in this courtroom.
24            You heard from him and the other corporate
25       representative, Kristy Leung.

 1            Number 14, please.
 2            She was their marketing person who we made,
 3       under oath, sit down and speak to a jury about the
 4       marketing over the past 50 years.
 5            And what you heard was, How did Lorillard go
 6       from just being a small company back in the 1700s to
 7       enter into the modern era of mass-produced
 8       cigarettes?  And you may recall some of the ads that
 9       were played and discussed with Ms. Leung.
10            Thank you.
11            They were on billboards.  They were on the
12       radio.  They had women dress up like a cigarette
13       pack with long legs and dance across a stage.  They
14       had placards in stores.  They had stickers in
15       windows.  They even had planes flying over
16       neighborhoods with loudspeakers, you may recall,
17       talking about their product.
18            No detail was too small.  No method was
19       insignificant.  If you were a human being in the
20       United States in the '40s, '50s and beyond, you
21       heard tobacco messages.  That's what the evidence
22       has shown.  And Lorillard knew exactly how to do
23       that.
24            When the '50s came around and this new device
25       called the television showed up, they knew, We've

 1       got to get on that, too.  And they started
 2       sponsoring TV perhaps.  Dick Van Dyke, for instance,
 3       The Web that you've heard about.  Commercials.
 4            They were in your face 24/7, although back then
 5       TV wasn't even on 24/7.  There were about three main
 6       channels.  TV went off the air at the end of the
 7       day.  It was on for a brief part of the day, not
 8       like today where you can find any channel anytime or
 9       you can go to an Internet.  There was none of that.
10       People either sat next to a radio or they looked at
11       the TV for those limited hours and they were
12       captive, and if a commercial came on, they had your
13       attention.
14            On the radio they had Frank Sinatra.  You heard
15       about him, too.  They actually had Frank Sinatra
16       selling some of their -- some of their cigarettes. 17       They used W.C. Fields.  You saw his picture.  He was
18       very famous in his day.  Eddie Cantor.  They used
19       athletes.  They used caricatures of people that
20       we'll show you, youthful people.
21            They even decided and determined after the
22       cancer scare steered them to The Plaza Hotel in
23       1953, We need to take advantage and exploit this
24       health scare.  We must assure our smokers.  We're
25       going to assure them that it's all right to smoke.

 1       We're going to assure them, just like the Frank
 2       Statement, we're here to protect you.  We're going
 3       to give them reassurance to keep lighting up and
 4       keep buying them.
 5            Kent cigarette, the greatest health protection
 6       in cigarette history.  If you had heard those words
 7       from an attorney standing before you three weeks
 8       ago, you would say, That guy is making up something
 9       that we would never say today.  And, yet, they
10       boldly put it on TV.  They boldly put it in print.
11       They claimed the Micronite filter, which was from
12       atomic energy plants, hospital rooms, the purest
13       filter, outlasted its competition.  They had the
14       gall to say it was the greatest health protection in
15       cigarette history.  Because they knew people were
16       starting to become health-conscious about cigarette
17       smoking.
18            And Mr. Anderson kind of talked with you about
19       that in opening.  It's absurd in 2011 to talk about
20       a health-conscious smoker, but that's what was going
21       on in the '50s, and you-all saw that.  That's what
22       was going on in the '60s and into the '70s.
23            We went from a nation that smoked almost
24       entirely filterless cigarettes in the '40s to the
25       '50s they started making filters, including the

 1       Micronite filter, the greatest health protection in
 2       cigarette history.
 3            And later, as we're going to talk about, you
 4       heard Lorillard even devised a system, Well, if we
 5       make a cigarette longer, we can tell those
 6       health-conscious smokers, You'll smoke less because
 7       they take longer, the Max cigarette.
 8            They knew how to exploit.  And Kristy Leung,
 9       their corporate representative, had -- well, she did
10       what she could.  She really sat here and tried to
11       debate whether or not they advertised their
12       cigarette as being a health cigarette or safe
13       cigarette.  So we had to bring you evidence.
14            Ms. Chaney, Number 165, please.
15            The documents I'm putting up will be in
16       evidence.  And if you could -- this was in 1964,
17       much later than even the '50s scare, so we
18       continued -- Kent had been out since the early '50s. 19            September 15th, 1964, Mr. Yellen and
20       Mr. Cramer, the president and chief executive
21       officer of Lorillard.  And he's saying, You want to
22       know from me, how did we get here?  What are we
23       doing here?  Where are we going from here?  What did
24       we know?  When did we know it?  What are we going to
25       do about it?  Three questions.

 1            Lauren, would you highlight the lower
 2       paragraph?
 3            Let me start with Kent.
 4            As all of us are aware -- this is internally --
 5       we will market the Kent as a safer cigarette for the
 6       smoker who is concerned about smoking and health.
 7            And in 1956, when an innocent third party,
 8       Reader's Digest, published or created an awareness
 9       to the consumer that Kent was the, quote, safest,
10       unquote, of all popular filter cigarettes -- let me
11       stop there.  Reader's Digest you heard a little bit
12       about.  They come out with a study, their study,
13       saying this is the safest cigarette.
14            And what does Lorillard do with it?  They
15       exploited the advantage.  Lorillard exploited this
16       advantage so that within a short period of two years
17       the Kent volume grew from less than four billion
18       cigarettes to 38 billion annually, even though they
19       knew that Kent cigarettes provided absolutely no
20       better protection than any other filtered cigarette,
21       even though they knew that filtered cigarettes,
22       period, provided no better protection than
23       non-filtered.
24            Ms. Leung tried to explain to you how, We've
25       always been a responsible marketer.  But what she

 1       didn't want to admit was a document that came from
 2       the FTC.
 3            I believe it's Number 184, Ms. Chaney.
 4            I'm sorry.  Wrong one.  733.
 5            All right.  In 1955, the Federal Trade
 6       Commission wrote to Lorillard.
 7            Let's go to the second page, please.
 8            And can you blow that up?
 9            And they were concerned that Lorillard was
10       making health claims with their cigarettes.  This
11       was in '55.  Basically saying, The smoke of Kent
12       cigarettes does not contain significantly less
13       nicotine or tar than smoke from other filter-tip
14       cigarettes, and insofar as the claim, quote,
15       unquote, "cleans the smoke" is concerned, contains
16       substantial quantities of both nicotine and tars.
17            They're telling them, Despite your great
18       filter, despite your claims, it's not reducing it.
19            This named test results indicate that the smoke
20       from Kent cigarettes does not contain significantly 21       less nicotine than any other popular brand or
22       non-filter.  They conclude, We question the
23       propriety of the themes that were referenced.
24            Thank you, Lauren.
25            The reason I brought that up is that, again, in

 1       1964, the document we just saw where they are now
 2       going to exploit it, they are going to get back to
 3       the health claims, even though they were told in '55
 4       by the FTC, You don't have any basis to say it.
 5            Why were they doing it in 1964?  The Surgeon
 6       General came out.  The next scare was coming out.
 7       People were going to be hearing that cigarette may
 8       be hazardous to your health.
 9            So what did they do?  You heard the testimony.
10       They started giving Kent cigarettes out in those
11       four-pack samples that Kristy Leung told you about.
12       In December before the Surgeon General, December of
13       '93 [sic], put out the samples.  It's going
14       amazingly well.  The people want them.
15            They are anticipating the public health
16       officials who are going to say smoking is hazardous
17       or may be hazardous, and now they are going to
18       exploit.  Let's go back to our roots.
19       Kent cigarettes, the greatest health protection in
20       cigarettes.  Let's talk to people about filters.
21       And you saw in the '64 document sales skyrocketed in
22       two years, four billion to 38 billion.
23            So, as I was saying, the marketing by Lorillard
24       was fantastic and impressive.  And it can hardly be
25       argued that not any American was affected during the

 1       '50s and the '40s and even into the '60s and beyond
 2       by tobacco advertising and information.  The people
 3       they agreed with to get together, hang together or
 4       hang separately, get together and omit important
 5       information, create doubt and controversy.
 6            What did the FTC say about all the advertising
 7       that had been going on?
 8            Now 184, please.
 9            This is in 1967.  This is after the Surgeon
10       General's Report comes out in '64.  It is now after
11       '66.  The law changed.  We now have to put the
12       warning.  They have to put the "may cause" language
13       on the packets.
14            Let's go to the next, page, Lauren, that's
15       highlighted, and highlight it, please.
16            And you saw this in the courtroom.  You'll have
17       this in evidence.  But this was basically a
18       recitation of what had been going on over the past
19       20, 30 years.  And it spoke volumes.
20            Cigarette advertising reaches virtually all
21       Americans who can either read or understand the
22       spoken word.  Pretty big group. 23            Cigarettes are advertised on the network in
24       spot television, on the radio, in magazines and
25       newspapers, in outdoor media, and by means of many

 1       types of point of sale advertising aids.  So
 2       pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is
 3       virtually impossible for Americans of almost any age
 4       to avoid cigarette advertising.
 5            And they go on and talk about exactly where you
 6       see it.  And there cannot be any doubt or dispute in
 7       this courtroom that Lorillard knew it was out in the
 8       public.  Frankly, Kristy Leung didn't want to admit
 9       it, but at times like this when they won't tell you
10       what you need to hear, I think it's important --
11       let's take a look at what they're saying when
12       patting themselves on the back, when they're
13       bragging.
14            And so what we've done is given you the annual
15       reports for each of the years in the '50s and '60s,
16       when they're patting themselves on their backs to
17       their shareholders and saying, Here's what we are
18       doing for you, shareholder.  Here's how we're being
19       good stewards of your money, how we are growing
20       sales, and here's how we're doing it.
21            You'll have those annual reports in evidence,
22       but I'd like to at least give you a little sample.
23            P-8, please.
24            I'm sorry.  Number 8, I'm sorry.  Not P-8,
25       Number 8.

 1            Here we are in the 1952 report, before the
 2       scare really comes out, but they're starting to make
 3       the Kent cigarette.  Let's go to our advertising
 4       page.
 5            Amazing what someone will tell you when it's
 6       time to brag.  Isn't that really human nature?
 7       Isn't that common sense?  When you're not worried
 8       about what you're saying on a video screen in front
 9       of a jury and watching every single word and trying
10       to deny that the kids are seeing your ads or that
11       your ads are effective, when you're patting yourself
12       on the back, telling the people you work for, your
13       shareholders, you say amazing things, things that
14       you would never say today.  And Kristy Leung proved
15       it.  She wouldn't say it today.  They're not
16       apologizing.
17            So let's see.
18            Probably no consumer product is more sensitive
19       to advertising than cigarettes; none.  According to
20       them, no consumer product.  They are asked for by
21       specific brand names millions of times a day at the
22       counters of 1.3 million retailers who hand over the
23       smoker's choice.  Brand loyalty is principally
24       established by the force of advertising. 25            There was no one more brand-loyal for almost

 1       30 years than Jackie Miller.  You couldn't hear from
 2       Jackie Miller in this courtroom, but you heard
 3       people who knew her and you heard what actions she
 4       took.  And there can be really no question that
 5       Jackie Miller heard messages by the things she did
 6       and said.
 7            She maintained brand loyalty, and I'll talk a
 8       little more about that, but she switched from
 9       filterless to filter when the health scare came out
10       and they started using that to their advantage, when
11       they started exploiting things, and never went back
12       to filterless.
13            She makes a comment to her sister in the late
14       '60s that is essentially parroting some of the
15       themes that the greatest health cigarette is ever
16       promoting, that these are better for you.
17            How would she know that unless that's what she
18       saw?
19            She makes comments later about the Max
20       cigarette, that, These are longer, they're -- it
21       takes me longer to smoke them.
22            Isn't it interesting that Jackie Miller just
23       happened to switch from filterless, those
24       Chesterfields and Old Golds which were filterless,
25       and you'll see that stipulation, to filtered.  And

 1       the filter brand she goes to is Kent, the one that
 2       is the most touted in America.  How does that just
 3       happen?
 4            No consumer product is more susceptible to
 5       advertising than cigarettes.  That's how it happens.
 6            You talk about the greatest health protection
 7       in cigarette history, and is it any shock to you
 8       that some people will actually be a health-conscious
 9       smoker, as that term would be used in the '50s, and
10       go to your product?  That's what you intended;
11       that's what happened.
12            Is it just coincidence that Jackie Miller, when
13       she switched away from Kent, decided, I'm going to
14       go to a women's brand, Max cigarettes that they
15       created?  It was targeted to women.  It was longer
16       so you'd smoke less.
17            Is it any coincidence that when she smoked and
18       switched to Max that she went to a women's brand?
19       How do you know it's a women's brands unless you've
20       seen the ads that it is being promoted to women?
21            That's what they intended to happen.  That's
22       what did happen.  Again, you can't hear from Jackie
23       Miller to tell you why she did what she did, but you
24       can infer.  You can take reasonable inferences from
25       the evidence you've heard and the actions she did to
3958 1       say, Yes, Jackie Miller must have been impacted by
 2       their specific advertising and of their group, the
 3       whole agreement of all advertising.  She was a
 4       health-conscious smoker as that term was used back
 5       then.  She switched to filters.
 6            Later she switched to the longer cigarettes.
 7       She told her sister, This one is better for you.
 8       She's parroting the very language that they are
 9       selling to the public.
10            And most importantly, when her sister
11       confronted her -- you may recall in the end of the
12       '60s, Carol Gibson, who talked to you, said, I think
13       our dad died about seven years ago, six or seven
14       years ago, from lung cancer from smoking.  And what
15       did Jackie tell her?  You heard her.  I don't
16       believe that.
17            She said, But the warnings are on the pack.
18            She said, I don't believe that.  I don't think
19       that's been proven.
20            Where in the past two weeks have you heard
21       that?  Every document that tobacco has issued, all
22       the news pieces that we even showed, for instance,
23       yesterday with Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, who didn't want
24       to show you them, the tobacco industry who spoke for
25       them said, The case is still open.  It's still not

 1       proven.
 2            Is it really any coincidence that she is
 3       uttering the words that they have been the
 4       mouthpiece for?  That's what they intended and
 5       that's what happened.
 6            The advertising was so pervasive by this
 7       company and the industry, no one who could read or
 8       speak could have missed it.  No one.  So pervasive.
 9       It would be like the paint in this wall -- on the
10       wall.  It's like how do you miss the paint in the
11       walls?  I don't notice it, but it's everywhere.
12            We talked a little about it on voir dire, but
13       you go by the evidence here.  How do you know when
14       you're directly being impacted by an ad?  The best
15       ads are the ones that make you think it's your idea,
16       the ones that make you buy and you don't even
17       remember, Why was it that I wanted that product?
18            Let's talk about how Jackie started, because we
19       know from the evidence she started as a teenager.
20       And that's important.  How did we get to teen
21       smoking in the 1940s?  Well, we can only look at --
22       at what they did and start inferring, because
23       Jackie's not here to talk to us about it.
24            I'll give you a couple examples.
25            1356.

 1            If you were athletic, smoking was for you.  If
 2       you're a young girl, smoking's for you.  Not only 3       smoking, but Old Gold cigarettes, the very brand
 4       that Jackie smoked in the '40s.
 5            Now, did you hear any witness say she saw that
 6       ad?  No.  But when you look at how they're patting
 7       themselves on the back, How many homes are we
 8       reaching in all our advertising, you've got to ask
 9       yourselves, Isn't that what they intended?  Isn't
10       that what occurred?  What did they know, when did
11       they know it, and what were they doing with it?
12            Let's go to 363, please.
13            Santa Claus, puppies and cartons of cigarettes.
14       Who's that appealing to?  Jackie Miller, although
15       she didn't ask for Old Golds at Christmas, thought
16       why not get cartons of cigarettes for Christmas, and
17       asked her friend at the town hall.  That's what the
18       cigarette industry intended.  It's now a holiday
19       thing.
20            So if you're a woman, you're athletic or you're
21       a young girl, smoking's for you.  If you like
22       holidays, we've got you covered there too.  Which
23       population really worries about Santa Claus and
24       little puppies?  We've got you covered.
25            Jackie fit in.  She fit exactly the consumer

 1       they wanted.  And for them to say that, We didn't
 2       intend, or didn't know -- frankly, to have
 3       disregarded the fact that teens in the 1940s like
 4       Jackie Miller were buying their cigarettes is
 5       preposterous.
 6            How about 366?
 7            Sorry.  Too quick for me.
 8            You had it right.  I'm sorry.
 9            Old Golds, right on Father's Day.  So now if
10       you enjoy family holidays, family functions,
11       cigarettes are for you.  Not only that, it's
12       perfectly acceptable for kids to be handing up
13       cigarettes to their parents.  Perhaps that was one
14       of those we would never say that today, but we're
15       not apologizing for it, but that's what was going
16       on.
17            Can it honestly be said that we're not
18       expecting kids to say, How do I please Dad, back in
19       the '40s?  You know, times were different.  Dad
20       would come home.  Family would be waiting.  You
21       know, hard day at work.  Dad sits back.  What have
22       we got for you?  The dog is waiting for you.  The
23       kids are waiting for you.
24            I wonder where Jackie Miller got the idea that
25       it's all right to smoke with family or share

 1       cigarettes with her daughter or ask for cigarettes
 2       from her family members.  I just wonder where she
 3       got that idea from.
 4            That's what they intended.  That's what 5       happened.  And they can't sit here and be surprised.
 6            So you could be a young girl, you could be
 7       athletic, you could like holidays and puppies and
 8       Santa Claus, you could be a family person, you could
 9       be a child.  They've got something for you.  And
10       that's when she was smoking cigarettes as a
11       teenager.
12            How about 365, please?
13            Old Gold again.  You can be a student.  You can
14       be the guy they look up to or you can be the girl
15       that wants to be noticed.  You heard that from one
16       of her friends, didn't you?  We all wanted to be
17       noticed.
18            Interesting when Kristy Leung was trying to
19       explain away that document.  Remember what she said
20       about him?  That boy -- I mean, guy.  That's how she
21       said it.  Why?  Because he does look young.
22            School-age kid?  I've got a product for you.
23       Now, did they say specifically high school?  No.
24       But were they telling the message that you shouldn't
25       be?  No.  And for them to throw that out in the

 1       marketplace and Jackie Miller in her teens is a high
 2       school smoker and then try to claim, We didn't
 3       intend it, that is reckless disregard for the
 4       consequences to smokers and teenagers.
 5            You heard from Dr. Werner.  Teens do not have
 6       the ability to make an informed choice about a drug
 7       like nicotine, period.
 8            Why don't we show 31 after this one here.  We
 9       have -- we've got New Smyrna Beach High School.
10            P-31.
11            We heard a lot about New Smyrna Beach High
12       School, across the street where they smoke.  Any
13       surprise that after the last ad we saw that kids
14       from this high school, including Jackie Miller, used
15       Old Gold cigarettes across the street?
16            You've got the boys who want to be cool, you've
17       got the girls who want to be noticed, and you've got
18       Jackie who's right there with them, and you've got
19       them smoking Old Gold cigarettes.  That's what they
20       intended, that's what happened, and now they can't
21       be surprised that you will hold them accountable.
22            So how did they do it?
23            P-28.
24            Well, I'd ask you to consider that Lorillard
25       Tobacco Company made a deal with a 16-year-old girl,

 1       a 16-year-old girl, to smoke their cigarettes, to
 2       become a brand-loyal customer.
 3            P-29, please.
 4            They knew through their research you need
 5       marketing.  No consumer product is more sensitive to
 6       advertising.  And you saw the testimony from 7       Ms. Leung.  When we put money into ads, that product
 8       flourished.  It happened with Old Gold, it happened
 9       with Kent, and eventually it happened with Newport.
10       When they took money away from the ads and when they
11       walked away from the health assurance of Kent, the
12       sales started going down.
13            So they needed to market, and they knew
14       nicotine was addictive.  They knew more than anybody
15       on the street -- they knew more than Dr. Burns they
16       told you.  If we knew what they knew, we wouldn't
17       have said what we did.  There was a time when he
18       advised his patients that, You should probably
19       switch to a filter cigarette.
20            But they knew.  They're the expert.  They're
21       the ones with research and development and hundreds
22       of people working on staff.  They're the ones who
23       want to put the product out.
24            If we get you as a youth, we've got you for
25       life.

 1            So how do they do it?  They create doubt and
 2       controversy.  Even though you're going to hear and
 3       did hear all the health claims that were aware in
 4       the '50s, '60s on that Dr. Roberts told you about.
 5       Tobacco was the master of creating doubt and
 6       controversy.  No, no, it's not been proven.  There's
 7       only a causal link.
 8            They always had a different word for it, create
 9       doubt and controversy, reassure the smoker who is
10       smoking.  Reassure the nicotine addict who needs to
11       rationalize what they're doing.
12            What did they do?  They didn't admit that
13       cigarettes caused disease until 2000, the year 2000.
14       You heard a lot about cigarette warnings, and they
15       wanted to parade those in front of you.  Every time
16       you see a cigarette warning on the screen or hear it
17       talked about, remember, they didn't agree with any
18       of them until 2000, except one.  Remember
19       Mr. Spears, when we were reading his deposition, he
20       did admit that cigarettes have carbon monoxide
21       in them.
22            But up until 1997 when he testified, he didn't
23       believe there was a problem with cigarettes.  He
24       didn't believe it was proven.  He didn't believe any
25       of the warnings on the packs.  And nor did his

 1       predecessors, Mr. Tisch or Mr. Orlowsky.
 2            So every time they talk about their warning
 3       labels and how everybody else knew, ask yourself,
 4       What did you know, when did you know it, and what
 5       did you do about it?  Because the evidence is clear
 6       they have never done anything for the smoker's
 7       benefit and the public's benefit until they've been
 8       required to. 9            Before they were required to slap a label on
10       their cigarette pack, they had the option to warn
11       people before.  Didn't do it.
12            You saw it this morning with Mr. Woods.  The
13       list of ingredients they put on their website March
14       of 2010.  You heard their testimony before.  Until
15       the '80s when they were required to disclose those
16       ingredients, they didn't do it.  They did not do it
17       until they were forced to do it.
18            So for them to come into the courtroom and wrap
19       the warnings around them like the American flag and
20       point to the smoker and say, It's all your fault,
21       either/or, well, that defies your common sense.
22            It's time to compare and measure
23       responsibilities and faults and say, No, Lorillard,
24       you needed to stand up and agree that you were
25       partially at fault, and we are going to evaluate

 1       what you knew, when you knew it, and what you did
 2       about it, or looking at it the other way, what you
 3       didn't do about it, and hold you equally
 4       responsible.
 5            Pardon me a minute.
 6            Nicotine we learned about.  Nicotine is a drug
 7       which, incidentally, you heard from Dr. Robinson,
 8       even though they admitted in 2000 that cigarettes
 9       were addictive, they didn't admit until about a
10       month before his deposition that nicotine is a drug,
11       when the FDA wanted to regulate them.  They never
12       moved until they were forced to.  And instead, doubt
13       and controversy.  They always had an answer for the
14       public and they always had a criticism of the
15       Surgeon General.  Always.
16            What did they do?  What did they do with the
17       information?  Criticize.  Doubt and controversy.
18       And why?  To reassure smokers who had a disease of
19       addiction, an addiction that you heard from
20       Dr. Werner, the only expert in this case to talk to
21       you about addiction in this courtroom, to say that
22       addiction, that disease undermines your ability to
23       motivate to quit.  It starts to remove free choice.
24            Jackie Miller, she said, was addicted.  Jackie
25       Miller had her motivation undermined by this

 1       disease.  Her free choice was affected.  Not that it
 2       can't be quit, you can't quit, but it was affected.
 3            If they had someone to say that's not true,
 4       they would have brought them to you.  If they had an
 5       expert to say, No, I disagree, Jackie Miller's free
 6       choice was not affected; no, I disagree, Jackie
 7       Miller, her motivation was not undermined; don't you
 8       think you would have heard that?
 9            They had no problem parading an expert in here
10       at over half a million dollars to tell you a little 11       bit about the history of tobacco and the awareness,
12       and, yet, when we come to the main issue in the
13       case, whether someone's addicted and can quit, there
14       was silence.  The silence was deafening.
15            The only evidence you have is from Dr. Werner,
16       the evidence that you've sworn you're going to
17       follow.  She was addicted; it was a disease;
18       nicotine was a drug; it undermined her motivation to
19       be able to quit; it removed her free will; it caused
20       her to continue to smoke.
21            That's the evidence you heard from the only
22       board-certified psychiatrist that walked into court
23       to talk about addiction.
24            Now, you heard from Dr. Burns, who told you
25       that from the Frank Statement on, the tobacco

 1       industry, including Lorillard, acted irresponsibly,
 2       plain and simple.  He said, No, it was not true that
 3       there was -- that it wasn't proven.  They said the
 4       opposite.  No, it's not true that nicotine's
 5       addictive.  They keep saying the opposite.
 6            Every time we issued a Surgeon General report,
 7       he told you, every time, they always had an answer.
 8       And it was never applause.  It was always criticism.
 9       It was always filled with scandalous remarks about
10       how the Surgeon General is misleading the American
11       public, how it is a scare tactic.
12            So when they ask you to consider what Jackie
13       Miller knew and when she knew it and what she did
14       with it, please compare what they were doing with
15       the information.  How can they expect you to hold
16       Jackie Miller to a standard that they refuse to live
17       by?
18            When their executives walked in in 1997 for
19       their depo, and 1993, and said, I don't believe it's
20       addictive, I don't believe it causes harm, how can
21       they honestly say to you that she was acting
22       unreasonably, that she should know more than the
23       experts?
24            Dr. Spears had been there for over 30 years and
25       ascended to the throne at Lorillard.  Well, to give

 1       you a little break, we came in and said, Yeah, she's
 2       still, though, partially at fault.  We did that.
 3       And yet they're still going to sit there with
 4       Dr. Spears from the throne and say she knew more,
 5       she should have done more, she should be solely
 6       responsible.
 7            I would submit you should reject that
 8       all-or-nothing approach.  Just like Dr. Werner told
 9       you, it's not just all or nothing.  It's not just
10       enjoyment or addiction or choice and addiction.
11       They work together.  The disease of addiction is
12       not -- is not negligence.  It's not even fault.  But 13       she was trying to overcome it.
14            Enjoyment.  Dr. Werner told you there's no way
15       an untrained person can look at an addict and say,
16       when they're using it, Ah, that's enjoyment.
17            Presumably they would get on the stand or get
18       up here and tell you that in that last week of her
19       life Jackie Miller, lying in her bed, asking her
20       daughter-in-law to take that smoke and puff it in
21       her face, she was enjoying it.  The last thing she's
22       doing and thinking about is enjoying a cigarette.
23            You know differently.  She was feeding an
24       addiction.  The brain, the receptors, they were
25       hungry.  She wasn't worried about food on that

 1       deathbed at that point.  She was worried about
 2       nicotine.  And that's what she got.  They knew it,
 3       they intended it, and that is what happened.
 4            I'm coming to the end of where I need to be
 5       finishing up with you on my first part, so I'm going
 6       to move quickly.
 7            In this case we're going to ask you to hold
 8       Lorillard Tobacco Company also liable to Jackie
 9       Miller for her death, also responsible, and we're
10       going to ask you to compare and measure the fault
11       about who knew what, when, and what they did with
12       it.  And we're going to trust you to do that.
13            But we're going to ask you to, at the end of
14       this case on the verdict form, hold them responsible
15       and actually speak loudly in this courtroom through
16       a verdict and say that their negligence from the
17       Engle findings was a legal cause of her death, it
18       substantially contributed to her lung cancer, in
19       combination with hers.
20            And His Honor is going to tell you about what a
21       term called concurring cause did.  If their
22       negligence acted even with hers or another's, it is
23       still a legal cause.  They are responsible for her
24       lung cancer and death.
25            We're going to ask you to find that their

 1       product defect, those unreasonably dangerous
 2       cigarettes, were also a legal cause of her death.
 3            We're going to ask you to find and hold them
 4       responsible for concealing information and agreeing
 5       and conspiring to withhold information and say, yes,
 6       that too played a part in her lung cancer and death.
 7       It was a legal cause.
 8            And then we're going to ask you to evaluate the
 9       loss that you've heard about in this courtroom, the
10       loss to Michelle Mrozek, Malia Torgensen, Robert
11       Miller, for the loss of their mother who died at
12       least statistically -- if you believe the Centers
13       for Disease Control, died 19.9 years too young
14       because of the lung cancer. 15            And we're going to ask you to evaluate what
16       those damages are for the loss of the companionship
17       of a mother, the loss of guidance from a mother and
18       protection.  And I would submit that you could
19       consider that using your common sense because jurors
20       really are the experts on human experiences.
21            But consider this.  Dr. Tisch took the -- or
22       Mr. Tisch took the stand when we read his
23       deposition, at the time top executive at Lorillard.
24       And we asked him, Did you contribute to the Tobacco
25       Institute?

 1            Yes, we did.  They spoke for us.
 2            How much did you contribute to the Tobacco
 3       Institute?
 4            And he told you three to four million dollars
 5       every year.  Every year.
 6            And I would submit to you when you're
 7       considering what has been lost, what was valued,
 8       what is gone forever, that you at least consider
 9       what they value.  The tobacco industry and CTR was
10       kind of like a brainchild, if you will, of the
11       industry.  It was their child that they put out
12       there, and they nurtured it with information and
13       they certainly nurtured it with 3- to $4 million out
14       of their pocket, Lorillard alone, every year.  And
15       what did they get?  Protection.  Comfort.  A valued
16       relationship.
17            I'd ask you to consider the loss to Mrs. Mrozek
18       and Ms. Torgensen and their brother, Mr. Miller, to
19       be equal to what Lorillard thought that value of the
20       TI was to them.  But we're going to leave that to
21       your discretion.
22            At the end of this case, we're going to ask
23       you, also, what's the last question, to consider
24       whether what we call punitive damages are warranted.
25       Now, those aren't just to compensate what was lost.

 1       These are determined to be for punishment and to
 2       deter conduct in the future.
 3            And you're going to have to prove -- we're
 4       going to have to show that to you, and have, by
 5       clear and convincing evidence, very specific
 6       evidence that you heard, that what they did they
 7       intended to do, that they were reckless with Jackie
 8       Miller as a teen; that what they did, they had --
 9       they were indifferent to whether she would pick up
10       the cigarette or any other teen; that during her
11       life when they were promoting their Kent cigarettes
12       that they were so grossly negligent that they
13       disregarded her health in telling her this is the
14       greatest health protection in cigarette history.
15       We're going to ask you to find and hold them liable
16       for punitive damages to punish them. 17            I think when you're considering the questions
18       we've been asking, I think in the punitive damages
19       on that last question, I'd ask you to consider it in
20       these terms.
21            P-20.
22            Lorillard had the means.  They had choices.
23       They made decisions.
24            21, P-21.
25            They had the motive to disregard the health

 1       consequences of people like Ms. Miller.
 2            P-22.
 3            Jackie Miller provided the opportunity.  And
 4       that's why they're liable for punitive damages.
 5            In closing, I think you heard at the beginning
 6       of this case that those Engle findings by themselves
 7       mean nothing for the defense, that they mean nothing
 8       more, nothing less.  And that's true.  Six findings
 9       thrown up on a board, on maybe a screen by
10       themselves, mean absolutely nothing.
11            But when you bring them into a court of law,
12       when you give nine jurors in this community who have
13       taken an oath to evaluate all the evidence and
14       fairly judge the case and you bring them before a
15       judge who wears a robe, with flags, and says, You
16       will consider only the evidence and use only the law
17       I give you, and you hear from witnesses over two
18       weeks and the evidence that you have heard, when
19       those six findings are applied to a jury like
20       yourselves to understand them and to apply them,
21       then they're not just nothing.  They don't just mean
22       nothing.  They are more than what they are once you
23       apply them to this case.
24            When you look at those six findings, and like
25       all the evidence you've had in this case, and you

 1       consider Jackie Miller, what she knew, when she knew
 2       it, what she did with the information, you compare
 3       to Lorillard what they knew, when they knew it, and
 4       what they did and did not do with it, we trust you
 5       will hold them accountable in this courtroom and say
 6       so with your verdict.
 7            Thank you.
 8            Thank you, Your Honor.


25             MR. PATACCA:  Counsel.  And, again, members of

 1        the jury, this is now my final opportunity to
 2        address points that were made during this
 3        Mr. Molony's closing on behalf of Lorillard Tobacco
 4        Company.  My purpose is not to reiterate everything
 5        I said in my first closing, that would be improper.
 6        It's to address what he brought up, but I think
 7        there are many things I do need to address.  I
 8        tried to organize them quickly in the break but,
 9        nonetheless, some of them may come in bullet-point
10        format, I'll apologize in advance.
11             First of all, I thought it seemed rather
12        peculiar, and perhaps when you review the evidence,
13        that Lorillard Tobacco Company came in today and
14        put documents up talking about cooperation and
15        discussed their cooperation in closing and patted
16        themselves on the back for how they worked with the
17        Tobacco Working Group and the Surgeon General and
18        they flip open a book and read an acknowledgment
19        saying, See, we were thanked for attending the
20        party, when the very first person that they were
21        talking about who cooperated was the gentleman you
22        heard from on the stand, Mr. Alexander Spears, III,
23        Ph.D., who testified before you from this stand on
24        April 15, 1997, under oath.  The very same
25        gentleman who had been with them for decades who

 1        was a chemist, Ph.D., and adamantly refused to
 2        believe that in 1997 smoking caused any related
 3        illness.  Period.
 4             And they want to pat themselves on the back
 5        and parade you, the jury, and supposedly, I guess,
 6        show you that they're doing good work by sending
 7        Mr. Spears into the henhouse and cooperate and try
 8        to cure and make a less hazardous cigarette when he
 9        doesn't even believe it's hazardous.  That's
10        allowing the fox into the henhouse, or worse,
11        reading the acknowledgment, "Thanks for coming to
12        the party," and then after the party is over you go
13        out and you talk behind the hostess's back.
14             The Surgeon General, he's misleading the
15        public, the Surgeon General, scare tactics.
16             No. 55 please.
17             Cooperation.  Here we are in 1988, this isn't
18        even back on the '64, this isn't even '72 where we
19        showed you the news report where they were talking
20        behind the hostess's back, so to speak.  1988, the 21        ones who are cooperating, quote/unquote, with the
22        Surgeon General, with public health in the public
23        interest come out with a press release, the TI,
24        Tobacco Institute, which speaks for the industry,
25        paid behind by them, comes out and says, "Claims

 1        that cigarettes are addictive, irresponsible, and
 2        scare tactics."
 3             THE COURT:  You want me to turn the mic off
 4        and you'll talk louder?
 5             MR. PATACCA:  Yes, sir.  If you don't mind.
 6        Thank you, Your Honor.
 7             THE COURT:  Just keep your voice up.
 8             MR. PATACCA:  Yes, sir.
 9             THE COURT:  You don't have to stand by the
10        mic, just keep your voice up.
11             MR. PATACCA:  Yes, sir.  Highlight just the
12        bottom for me, Ms. Chaney.
13             This is in 1988 after the rotating warnings,
14        remember we talked about wrapping ourselves in the
15        warnings and holding everyone else accountable,
16        holding everyone else responsible for what the
17        rotating warnings say, when the gentleman who
18        supposedly knows the most about Lorillard and
19        health issues, the one who is the cooperator, '88
20        they're saying the claim that there's a physical
21        dependence to smoking is simply a desperate attempt
22        to find some way to differentiate smoking from
23        other habits.
24             I would submit to you and your common sense
25        that if you invited such a person to your party and

 1        you were kind enough to thank them in the letter
 2        and say, "Thanks for coming to the party," and you
 3        heard that after the party they were sitting out
 4        back telling everybody what a terrible party it was
 5        and how you dropped the ball on all the
 6        hors d'oeuvres and you didn't invite the right
 7        people, and you were sending the wrong message and
 8        it was a complete waste of everybody's time, A,
 9        with a friend like that, you would never have a
10        friend again; and, B, you wouldn't invite him to
11        the party again.
12             So before you come into this courtroom in
13        north Florida down from Greensboro, North Carolina
14        and pat yourself on the back and tell what a
15        wonderful you did with Surgeon General and the
16        Tobacco Working Group, first of all, send somebody
17        who knows what he's talking about.  Send somebody
18        who believes in the message.
19             Mr. Anderson started this case is that,
20        wouldn't it have been different.  What if?  What if
21        they didn't always talk against the message?  What
22        if they actually joined the message?  What if they 23        came out with the Surgeon General every time and
24        said, We applaud the efforts of the Surgeon
25        General?  We know the Surgeon General's heart is in

 1        the right place.  We're going to work and do more
 2        with the Surgeon General.  What if Lorillard
 3        actually said to people like Jackie Miller on their
 4        packs before the warnings and said, We encourage
 5        you to smoke less?  What if they said, It's
 6        dangerous, before even the warnings came out and
 7        they meant it?  Not the warning they put on because
 8        they had to, because of all the regulations.  You
 9        saw regulations up on this timeline by Mr. Molony,
10        the whole closing, regulation, regulation,
11        regulation.  And we know they did nothing without
12        being regulated.
13             And, that, that's like catching your child
14        with his hand in the jar and saying, What are you
15        doing?  I said, don't eat the cookie before dinner.
16        He says, Oh, no, you're right, I'm not going to eat
17        the cookie.  And you know darn well he's going to
18        eat the cookie.  And now he's kind of looking at
19        you in disbelief like, Why would you punish me?  I
20        said I wasn't going to eat the cookie.  You know
21        darn well if you hadn't caught him, he was going to
22        eat the cookie.
23             For them to come to the courtroom and parade
24        that they cooperated with the Surgeon General and
25        the public health officials like Dr. Burns, a man

 1        who devoted his entire life to smoking and health
 2        for the public benefit, before they say all those
 3        comments like scare tactics, irresponsible, Surgeon
 4        General is the public enemy on this issue because
 5        you're misleading, before they call that
 6        cooperation, they should think about jurors like
 7        yourself who evaluate that and use their common
 8        sense.
 9             You took your child to that first day at
10        school and you said to your child, This teacher
11        deserves all your respect.  Listen to her, she's
12        going to give you good information, respect her,
13        like Mom and Dad do.  And then while you step back
14        and the kids are milling around listening to the
15        teacher who's doing her best to teach a roomful of
16        kids with everything she's got, the parent's
17        sitting back there with all new parents and say,
18        You know, I think she's biased.  She doesn't know
19        what she's talking about.  My kid shouldn't even be
20        listening.  If that were the type of cooperation
21        you found in the everyday experience, you'd call it
22        what it was, disruptive, ridiculous, irresponsible.
23        That discussion doesn't happen between you and the
24        teacher across the room with the child.  If you 25        have a disagreement, you do it in private.  There's

 1        a time and a place.
 2             No different in the tobacco controversy that
 3        they created in this United States America.  The
 4        greatest health issue affecting this country in the
 5        20th century, and instead of joining with the
 6        message, truly cooperating, they spoke across the
 7        room to the teacher, the Surgeon General, said,
 8        You're biased, scare tactics.  And the smokers
 9        don't know who to believe.  And then they're
10        surprised when one of them actually hears the
11        message and says, I don't believe it's been proven.
12        Use your common sense.  That's what's going on in
13        this courtroom in 2011.
14             You were told that at the end of the day all
15        Lorillard did was sell a legal product, and you
16        can't hold them responsible for just selling a
17        legal product.  I think Mr. Molony started his
18        opening two weeks ago and said, I think, I'm going
19        to predict that you're going to find this was a
20        typical customer/manufacturer relationship.
21        Typical, just a legal product.  And as he suggested
22        in his opening when he was talking about many
23        things, he said, But you know, members of the jury,
24        there's more work to be done here, you wouldn't be
25        here otherwise.  Instead, you're probably asking

 1        yourself, Why are we here?
 2             Well, before you learned any of the evidence,
 3        before you came into court, you might not have
 4        known, but because you sat for two weeks of
 5        testimony and all the exhibits you do know, because
 6        if Lorillard is saying that the typical
 7        customer/manufacturer relationship is where the
 8        manufacturer acts negligently, if the typical
 9        manufacturer sells a defective and dangerous
10        product to the customer, and if the typical
11        manufacturer also hides, omits, and conceals data
12        that people would want to know to defend
13        themselves, to arm themselves, to protect
14        themselves, and if the typical manufacturer agreed
15        with others to conspire to say, We won't release
16        the information for the mighty buck.  If that were
17        the typical manufacturing relationship, you would
18        turn your head and shake it and say, No way.  You
19        learned through two weeks of testimony this was not
20        a typical manufacturer/customer relationship.
21             In fact, I would suggest to you, you know more
22        in two weeks about both sides of the story where we
23        measure and compare than a distinguished professor
24        of history who took the stand.  In two weeks you
25        saw more internal documents than he even knew
4074 1        existed.  They brought you that man to tell you the
 2        story of tobacco, and he had to concede to
 3        Mr. Anderson, If I were doing my normal work where
 4        I publish a book where I would hope to get a
 5        Pulitzer, I would look at secondary sources and
 6        primary sources.  I'd go to archives.  I'd look in
 7        libraries.
 8             What did he do in this case?  Did he go to the
 9        archives?  Did he go to their library?  He didn't
10        even know they had a library.  Did he even show you
11        the news accounts that actually showed tobacco
12        cooperating on national news, blaming the host and
13        the hostess?  No.  I submit to you if Dr. Roberts
14        wanted to write the book today or write the
15        peer-reviewed article, it would be rejected because
16        it was one sided.  He didn't look at all the
17        evidence and, frankly, he was biased.
18             He had 500,000 good reasons over the last
19        eight to nine years why he might only look at one
20        aspect of the story.  And, frankly, he didn't even
21        come to them as an expert in tobacco.  He wasn't an
22        expert, he conceded, on anything with regard to the
23        smoking controversy.  He became an expert on that
24        portion of history when he came to them.
25             Now, had they wanted him to tell you about the

 1        history of boxing or John Wayne, he could have come
 2        in and said, I know that already, I'm ready to
 3        testify, tell me what I need to know about the
 4        specifics of the case.  But he didn't.
 5             They manufactured an expert in Dr. Roberts,
 6        plain and simple.  Unlike Dr. Burns, you heard he's
 7        made a lot of money, but over 25 years.  But he
 8        didn't develop his expertise to come into a
 9        courtroom, he was doing it before the Surgeon
10        General was really even ready.  He was with every
11        Surgeon General's report.  He went out of medical
12        school and joined the Clearinghouse for Tobacco and
13        Health.  He was doing it for real, and then he
14        said, This is such a great issue, I'm getting
15        involved, and that's what -- that's what he is.
16        That's who we brought you.  A real expert,
17        nonmanufactured.
18             Who else did we bring you?  They want to talk
19        about what they believe Ms. Miller was thinking,
20        that she must not had motivation, she must have
21        enjoyed it, she must have not wanted to quit.  We
22        lawyers aren't the evidence.  That's assumption.
23        That's advocacy for your client.  If they really
24        wanted to hear that Ms. Miller wasn't motivated,
25        they should have brought that expert to you on

 1        addiction to come in and say they already got what
 2        they needed out of Dr. Burns and Dr. Werner, well, 3        you consider that, you evaluate that talk.
 4             They should have brought you an expert to say,
 5        I'd like you to assume Ms. Miller's addicted.  Tell
 6        us about how she might still enjoy it.  You've
 7        heard absolutely no evidence in this courtroom
 8        other than from the University of Florida College
 9        of Medicine, Dr. Tonia Werner, who treats people,
10        inpatient, who teaches other psychiatrists, who
11        does both forensic work for the State, on both the
12        criminal side for the prosecutors and the defense,
13        on the civil side for civil commitments and cases
14        like this, and this is one of the few she's done of
15        tobacco.
16             She walked in the courtroom and gave it to you
17        all.  Now, if she were manufactured, she could come
18        in and say, No, no, no, even if you're addicted,
19        you can never quit.  And she didn't do that.  She
20        was candid.  Yeah, you still can quit, but it's
21        harder.  Every day's a struggle.  There's a cycle.
22        She gave it to you all.
23             They could have brought you an expert if they
24        really wanted you to surmise and assume and guess
25        what Jackie Miller must have been thinking or

 1        whether or not she really wanted to quit.
 2             The elephant in the room that's not been
 3        talked about is the disease.  And just like they
 4        don't want you -- they want you to say, Look, it's
 5        a legal product, you can't find liability for
 6        selling a legal product.  You cannot find liability
 7        because she had a disease.  There has to be
 8        conduct, unreasonable conduct.  And just as they
 9        say you can't find them liable just because they
10        sold a legal product, you can't hold her liable
11        just because she purchased a cigarette.  It's not
12        that easy in this courtroom.
13             You have to prove unreasonable conduct.  What
14        did she know, when did she know it, what did she do
15        with it?  What did they know, when did they know
16        it?  What did they do with it?  That's why we
17        compare, that's why we measure, that's why they
18        both contributed substantially to Jackie Miller's
19        smoking and her lung cancer and her death.  It's
20        not either/or.
21             They'd like you to think it was that simple.
22        In fact, when they read the instructions that
23        you're going to hear from the court, they kept
24        forgetting to mention the concurring cause as we
25        say.  I expect His Honor will read for you and

 1        continue on past where Mr. Molony did, for
 2        instance, under negligence, "In order to be
 3        regarded as a legal cause of injury, negligence
 4        need not be the only cause.  Negligence may be a 5        legal cause of injury even though it operates in
 6        combination with the act of another if the
 7        negligence contributes substantially to producing
 8        the loss."
 9             Even if she has fault it can act in
10        combination with their fault.  Even though she was
11        addicted and that was working against her, that can
12        work in combination with their fault.  And,
13        frankly, members of the jury, if they had an expert
14        who wanted to come in and say it played absolutely
15        no role, they could have brought that person in
16        here to provide you testimony under oath, again, so
17        we all hear the same evidence at the same time, no
18        independent research, and so both sides get to ask
19        questions on the stand, that's the fair way to do
20        it.
21             So if they wanted an expert to tell you, We
22        absolutely had no contribution, not even an iota,
23        they could have brought that you and they didn't.
24        That was their choice.  That's the evidence you now
25        have before you.  Uncontroverted by the only

 1        board-certified psychiatrist who walked into this
 2        courtroom, who evaluated this case to say she was
 3        addicted.  It undermined her motivation.  It
 4        affected her free will.  It caused her to smoke
 5        more.  It substantially contributed to her disease
 6        and her death.  There's absolutely no evidence from
 7        a qualified medical person otherwise.
 8             Well, what did they want to talk about?  Lay
 9        witnesses, as we call them as lawyers, nonmedical
10        personnel.  We called her friends.  And let me
11        remind you, we called them.  We knew what they were
12        going to say.
13             Let's talk about some of the witnesses.  I
14        mean, no witness is perfect in their memory, no
15        person is perfect in their memory, but we brought
16        you everything they had to say over 50 years
17        because you were entitled to know as much as we
18        could find out from Louise Fink, Ms. Schumacher,
19        Ms. Hall, Ms. Dawson.
20             Don't you think if Michelle Mrozek and her
21        Aunt Carol really wanted to make this look good, we
22        wouldn't bring you people that kind of give it both
23        ways?  Does that make sense?  They want you to use
24        the testimony of the people who took the stand like
25        the friends or even Ralph, who say just because

 1        they knew what they knew must prove what Jackie
 2        knew.  And just because they saw Ms. Miller
 3        smoking, that she must have enjoyed it.
 4             Dr. Werner already talked about that.  In true
 5        addiction, which there's no dispute about, true
 6        addiction, nobody disputes that.  In true 7        addiction, a layperson can't tell the difference
 8        between enjoyment and the perception of enjoyment
 9        because the addiction works on dopamine.  And I'd
10        like to talk about what that enjoyment is.  I mean,
11        for them to say she's constantly smoking in
12        pictures, that proves she must have enjoyed it, or
13        that she failed to stop, that must prove it.  What
14        that proves is she was addicted, there was no
15        dispute about that.
16             If she smoked one pack a day that was 20
17        cigarettes a day, two packs would be 40.  At some
18        point you heard it was three packs a day, 60.  I
19        would submit to you to consider that at certain
20        times in her life over decades there is nothing in
21        the human experience -- I know that Dr. Werner gave
22        you examples of dopamine, there is absolutely
23        nothing in the human experience that anybody would
24        ever do 40 and 60 times a day for pleasure because
25        at that point the novelty wears off, and I mean

 1        nothing.
 2             If she smoked each cigarette approximately ten
 3        minutes each, and we were to take the average of 30
 4        cigarettes, that's 300 minutes a day she's spending
 5        with a cigarette in her hand, smelling her fingers
 6        up, smelling the house up, taking up in her mouth,
 7        300 minutes, five hours of her day.  That's a
 8        full-time job.  That's a substantial portion of her
 9        life, and there was nothing more telling than when
10        she was diagnosed with cancer, enjoyment?  She
11        wanted to smoke.  The disease was so tight and so
12        strong in her she didn't even want hospice to be
13        called in.  Do you remember why?  She was afraid
14        they'd take the cigarettes away.  This is a woman
15        who's facing the end, she's not looking at what's
16        enjoyable or not.  She's facing, What do I need?
17             If they wanted any evidence for you to
18        consider in that jury room later this afternoon,
19        that she truly enjoyed it, that she was not ever
20        motivated, and that it wasn't affected by her
21        addiction, they could have brought you that very
22        expert and they did not, and that was their choice.
23             Now, we also brought you Dr. Robicsek, the
24        board-certified cardiothoracic surgeon.  That
25        gentleman has been performing surgery since the

 1        '50s, the first heart transplant.  Literally had
 2        someone's life in his hands in the '70s.  35,000
 3        procedures later, came in here to talk about it.
 4             And their first question or their biggest
 5        comment to him was, Didn't you know we all agree
 6        that smoking causes cancer in Jackie Miller?  You
 7        must have been thinking, Why is he here?  And now
 8        you know.  You didn't hear Mr. Molony ever say it, 9        yeah, we agree the Lorillard cigarettes caused it.
10        Instead he wants to talk about there's some gaps in
11        the '50s that we don't really know what she's
12        smoking, and there's cigarettes at the end, the
13        Misty's and the Capris and the Virginia Slims,
14        they'll say in big general terms that smoking
15        cigarettes cause cancer, but they're hoping you're
16        going to say, Well, maybe they didn't prove
17        Lorillard cigarettes did.  They're very careful
18        with their words, they could have just conceded
19        that to Dr. Robicsek.
20             I had to ask him that question, Did you have
21        an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical
22        certainty whether the Lorillard products that she
23        was smoking in the '50s, '60s, '70s and into the
24        '80s substantially contributed to causing her lung
25        cancer and death.  And he said, Absolutely, yes.

 1        Not even touched on cross-examination.  That's the
 2        evidence you have in this case.
 3             Now, what was important -- also important was
 4        that in the last five, six years they want to talk
 5        about risk reduction if you quit earlier, what
 6        might have been.  Let's go back, let's read minds,
 7        let's look back.  Dr. Robicsek told you this is one
 8        of the worst cancers in the world to get in the
 9        body.  Small cell carcinoma takes its victims very
10        quickly, year, year and a half regardless.  There
11        was nothing that Jackie did or didn't do in the
12        last five years, for sure, no questions asked, that
13        made a difference.  She had smoked enough over the
14        course of her life that she was going to get the
15        lung cancer and die.  Was just waiting to go.
16             So I don't know, honestly, what the
17        significance of the Misty's and the Capris and such
18        at the end were.  It certainly didn't make a
19        difference in the outcome.  But it is interesting
20        to kind of see that once again Jackie is
21        gravitating to the long skinny cigarettes that you
22        heard about, the Capris and Misty's, Virginia
23        Slims.  She's still sticking around with the
24        women's marketed cigarettes.  Certainly a woman who
25        is aware of the marketing.

 1             But, again, they never actually said to you
 2        what's not in dispute that was on the screen in the
 3        opening, Lorillard cigarettes caused the cancer.
 4        Never looked you in the eye and told you that, did
 5        they?
 6             I talked about memories so we'll go to Carol
 7        Gibson.  And, again, no witness's memory is
 8        perfect.  No human's memory is perfect.  And Carol
 9        Gibson tried to do the best she could recall.  And
10        the best criticism, as well, the first time we 11        asked her questions for six hours she didn't
12        remember exactly when the Kent started.  And she
13        said probably around '59.  She actually said when
14        they put it on the board and when they asked her,
15        Didn't you say this?  She actually said, It was
16        probably earlier but I just don't know.  And then
17        they want to criticize her for after thinking about
18        it, like many people do after they've been grilled,
19        and they start looking back over the years to say,
20        You know what, I remember even earlier when I was
21        younger and criticize her for saying, I'm willing
22        to get deposed again for hours and ask away.
23             And she told you she -- she gave you her best.
24        And their best criticism is, Well, she doesn't
25        remember anything because apparently her memory and

 1        Billie Carter Dawson's memory of the wedding is not
 2        the same.  You may recall, and I picked up on it,
 3        too, because, frankly, we've heard all testimony in
 4        the videos before you heard it, we know what
 5        they're going to say, but they asked her, Billie
 6        Carter Dawson, do you think she went to your
 7        sister's wedding when she eloped to Georgia or not?
 8        And she said, No, she was not there.  And I imagine
 9        some of you caught it and thought, Wait a minute,
10        Billie Carter Dawson said in her video she was at
11        that get-away.  And you must have been thinking,
12        What's going on?  That's certainly frailties of
13        memories and inconsistencies.  But let's remember
14        who else testified in this case.
15             I don't know where Billie Carter came up with
16        it, I don't know.  I'm not sure she came up with
17        anything, but that's what she remembers.  But Joan
18        Hall, the bride who actually went to Georgia
19        testified and what did she tell you?  The four of
20        us went up to Georgia to get married.  Jackie
21        Miller was coming with me to be my witness.  And
22        when we were there we got married.  She didn't say
23        anything about a party going up.  In fact, she
24        said, We got married and we came to Jacksonville
25        for a dinner and one-night honeymoon and went home.

 1             Now, does it make a hill-of-beans difference
 2        who went to the wedding in Georgia?  I would hope
 3        not.  I don't know.  But I just suggest to you that
 4        before we get overly critical of witness's
 5        testimony over a span of decades on topics that
 6        they probably never thought they'd ever be asked
 7        again, have some understanding and common sense
 8        that not everything's going to be perfect.  And if
 9        we thought that everything had to be perfect, we
10        would have never brought you some of those
11        witnesses.
12             But since we're talking about forgiving and 13        misstatements and mistakes, Mr. Molony started off
14        telling you how he made a mistake two weeks ago
15        when he didn't mean to say, I'm not apologizing,
16        that was a mistake.  Now, Mr. Molony's a fine
17        attorney, fine, well-prepared presentation in
18        opening and closing.  I'll accept him at his word,
19        of course, that if he made a mistake, he made a
20        mistake because he meant to say he's not defending
21        them.  Well, I disagree there.  He is defending
22        them.  Now, when we talk about all the things in
23        the past that you would never say today, that
24        stuff, that was wrong, plain and simple.  But we
25        don't need Mr. Molony to speak for them.  We had

 1        Kristi Leung to speak for them.
 2             So when they had the person who could truly
 3        come in and speak to it, they had her, we had her.
 4        Now, you have to go by your memory.  I'll go by my
 5        notes, but it's Kristi Leung, their marketing
 6        director, was asked, "And it would be morally
 7        reprehensible as a company to take a product that
 8        is addictive and cause -- causes disease and target
 9        children with such a product, wouldn't it?"
10             And her answer, "My company believes that
11        smoking is a choice that only adults should be able
12        to -- only adults are mature enough to make.  And,
13        therefore, we don't target our advertising and
14        marketing efforts to children."
15             Now, on its face it sounds like a fine answer,
16        but if you were going to apologize for the past,
17        the person from Lorillard could have said it.  And
18        more importantly, when you hear Kristi Leung's
19        testimony, when you heard it, evaluate like you
20        would any other witness, because His Honor's going
21        to tell you, consider what their demeanor, their
22        frankness, but also what interest did they have?
23        They want to talk about Carol Gibson hoping, you
24        know, her niece does well.  Think about what
25        interest Lorillard's own employees have this in

 1        case.
 2             Why didn't she want to admit that, yeah, there
 3        were times when our advertising was over the top
 4        and we did target teens and Ms. Miller was a teen
 5        when she was smoking.  Wouldn't it have been more
 6        credible to say, Mistakes were made, things were
 7        done that we wouldn't have done now, we would never
 8        do that.  That was the time to say it.  Instead,
 9        she said, "No, we don't even -- we don't even study
10        teens."
11             And then it came out in the examination,
12        "Well, actually, you do study some teens because we
13        found out in New Jersey, you're saying the base of
14        all your students then or your smokers then, this 15        is later, is the high school students.  So whether
16        you're targeting or not, you're studying it, and
17        you know it's going on."
18             And she says, "Well, that's inconsistent with
19        everything I've seen."
20             So there was another opportunity, a choice to
21        be made to fess up and say, Mistakes were made,
22        documents show that perhaps my research wasn't as
23        thorough.  And then, amazingly, on redirect
24        examination she said, You know what, I found a few
25        other documents, when he asked her questions.

 1        Yeah, there were other documents of youth smoking,
 2        that she was never going to volunteer until he
 3        asked her again.  Another choice to not come clean
 4        and say things were done that shouldn't be done
 5        today, and we acknowledge them up front.
 6             It was always a teasing out, a pulling out,
 7        oh, if you've got a document that proves it, okay,
 8        I'll admit it.  But if you don't and you don't have
 9        me with my hand in the cookie jar, I'm not going to
10        admit it.  Consider that in Kristi Leung.  Kristi
11        Leung who's been there about ten years, when people
12        in her department have been there 30 years and
13        probably could speak to this.
14             So I guess they had their opportunity, if you
15        will, to speak to you and say mistakes were made
16        and things were done improperly from the corporate
17        representative, not the attorneys.  So there'd be
18        no misunderstanding that they didn't and they don't
19        and they won't and that's because they just don't
20        get it.  That's why we brought up the fact that
21        there are documents continuing on over the decades.
22        Yes, Mrs. Miller's not a teen as she gets older,
23        but it shows the intent is still there later.  So
24        when you tell us under oath and say to this jury,
25        We didn't mean it back then and don't even agree it

 1        occurred, the jury is allowed and it is fair to
 2        consider, Wait a second, perhaps you're not giving
 3        us everything we need to know about what was going
 4        on in the '40s with Ms. Miller if you're still
 5        doing and still studying -- despite all the
 6        evidence, you're still doing it now.
 7             That's why that was important.  That's why it
 8        is important.  They just don't get it.  It's a
 9        continuing course of conduct by this company that
10        just doesn't get it.  Until it's regulated, they
11        don't stop.
12             They made a point of how we prevetted all our
13        ads to the FTC in '58.  Everything went to the FTC.
14        Of course, I showed you the document from 1955.
15        They got -- their hand was in the cookie jar, and
16        the FTC and said, You're making claims that are not 17        true with respect to your filters.  So don't pat
18        yourself on the back and come in here in front of a
19        jury and say, Well, look, we're just -- we're
20        working on the rules.  When you're not looking,
21        when you weren't looking, I got caught, but now
22        we're working on the rules.  Don't worry, I'm not
23        going to eat the cookie before dinner, Dad.  That's
24        what's going on here.  Now you know.
25             You know, going back it's -- now you know,

 1        like I said, what Dr. Robinson [sic] doesn't even
 2        know, he didn't even look at half the stuff.
 3        Really, when you think about Dr. Robinson, I mean,
 4        the reason we asked him questions wasn't because
 5        we -- we disagree that there wasn't a lot of
 6        information in the news, there was.  But he didn't
 7        research both sides of the story.  And because of
 8        that, he had no idea what's going on in this
 9        courtroom because what Dr. Robinson basically did
10        was indict their company.  He basically came in to
11        tell you, well, everybody's always known or at
12        least been aware, and as the decades went on they
13        became more aware, and there was a great percentage
14        that believed and there really was no doubt and
15        there really was no controversy, and what he didn't
16        know was people like Dr. Spears in '97 are still
17        saying, I don't know what you're talking about,
18        it's not true, people who were making policy
19        decisions, the president, until 2000.
20             You heard that Mr. Orlowsky in 2000 made a
21        policy change to say, We will now admit smoking
22        causes disease.  It wasn't because the medicine had
23        changed from 1997 to 2000.  So ask yourself what
24        changed?  Policy.  Their admission about disease
25        and smoking is based on policy.  It is based on the

 1        almighty dollar that they collected from customers.
 2             When their fingers were all over the cookie
 3        jar in 2000 and the gig was up, they finally said,
 4        We admit it, yes, there's a process going on here.
 5        Robinson didn't know what you knew about these
 6        gentlemen's testimony, that they were still denying
 7        into '93 and '97.  Everything he said indicted
 8        them, that they were being reckless with what
 9        everybody else must have known, that they were
10        indifferent to what the rest of the country must
11        have been aware of.  Consider that when we talk
12        about what is clear and convincing.
13             Do you have to hesitate to think that
14        everything he said, everything he said about
15        awareness, about this greatest medical and
16        social -- public health problem in this country
17        was, everything he said went completely against
18        what they were still trying to say later.  Clearly, 19        convincingly, without hesitation.
20             I'm going to speed up.  Now, again, we were
21        talking about all the friends that we heard about
22        in Ms. Miller's life.  Timeline came up several
23        times.  Here's what I need to say about that.  In
24        1974 Harold Reid died.  They want you to infer that
25        Jackie must have known he died from lung cancer and

 1        smoking.  We don't know that, but they want you
 2        then to take the next leap to say, Well, she must
 3        have known he died from lung cancer from smoking,
 4        that it should have caused her to quit and that's
 5        why she's at fault, but it would have been such a
 6        monumental item in her life, her friend -- long
 7        friend, admittedly from high school, that he died
 8        and somehow that jump must have changed or should
 9        have changed her behavior.
10             Now, what they forgot on their timeline is
11        Harold's wife didn't even quit then.  I mean, they
12        obviously remembered she didn't quit then but they
13        forgot to square this.  She didn't even quit for
14        another six years.  Faced with the death of her own
15        husband supposedly because there was a link to
16        cancer and smoking, we'll accept that, she was so
17        shocked she kept on smoking.  Perhaps that shows
18        she was addicted.  I don't know.  That's not the
19        issue before you, Jackie Miller was.  But to infer
20        that Jackie should have known and should have
21        stopped then, that's an assumption.
22             Now, other friends of hers quit.  Billie
23        Carter Dawson quit in '77.  Like I said, Ms. Reid,
24        Ms. Fink quits in '81 -- or '80, rather.  What
25        they're showing you is that in that community of

 1        friends apparently it was not as well known as
 2        Dr. Roberts would have you believe.  You heard
 3        their testimony, I'll rely on your memory, that
 4        each and every one of them, some had heard about
 5        the Surgeon General's report, some hadn't, some
 6        were better aware than others.  And each was
 7        working through their own smoking issues.  It took
 8        the doctor, Dr. Darby, you heard about it, he had
 9        to come into Ms. Reid or Ms. Fink's hospital room.
10        It wasn't enough her husband died, but he had come
11        into the hospital room smoking and, basically, in
12        the hospital said, You want to see your
13        grandchildren, you got to stop.  And then it
14        finally hit her.  Apparently that was all it took.
15        You want to see your grandchildren, live that long,
16        you better do it now.
17             Now, Dr. Burns explained that to you.
18        Remember when faced with a life-and-death crisis a
19        lot of people, even addicts, will stop and
20        apparently she did.  But to say that Harold, her 21        husband, died and that's enough to cause Jackie to
22        smoke or stop smoking or should have, ignore the
23        very person she's been living with, sharing her
24        life with, went on another six years.  And there's
25        been no evidence.  They want to speculate with

 1        Dr. Darby must have told Jackie.  We don't know.
 2             But the point is Lorillard has known for
 3        decades, although they didn't admit until 2000,
 4        that millions of people will get smoking-related
 5        diseases.  They also know that a certain percentage
 6        maybe even millions don't get diseases.  They've
 7        known that millions of people will become addicted.
 8        But they also know some will not.  And of those
 9        millions that become addicted, some can quit and
10        some won't.  And the 90 percent you hear about
11        quitting, it takes on average seven times to quit.
12             But the point I raise is who is Lorillard to
13        know which smoker will get a disease and who will
14        not?  Who is Lorillard to know which smoker will
15        become addicted and who will not?  And which smoker
16        may be able to break the vicious cycle of addiction
17        and who will not?  They simply cannot.  And that's
18        why a reasonably prudent person or company would
19        have to give material information to people to help
20        them arm themselves, because they can't know, just
21        like the smokers can't know.  But they were in a
22        better position to know.
23             They want you to make Jackie Miller an
24        epidemiologist.  You heard that term, a
25        statistician on health.  They want you to take all

 1        the information she heard about who died when and
 2        what it might have been from, including her dad who
 3        she didn't believe, that she should have put
 4        together all the statistics to go, Aha, smoking
 5        causes cancer, I'm a smoker, it must be that I'm
 6        going to die of cancer.  And yet they were the very
 7        ones who criticized the host of the party for
 8        giving epidemiological evidence.  They're the
 9        experts, not her, and they want to hold her to a
10        higher standard.  What did they know, when did they
11        know it, and what did they do with the information?
12             The other little fact on that timeline that
13        wasn't talked about that I'd ask you to consider is
14        this agreement, this conspiracy, the whole
15        industry, what they know.  What they really know
16        is, not only does it kill you, but they need to
17        replace you.  Can't have a viable business model if
18        all your smokers die.
19             So what they didn't mention, although you saw
20        it on the timeline, in 1974 Harold dies.
21        Fortunately, for some manufacturer, Michelle Mrozek
22        one year later steps in and starts smoking.  In 23        1977 Billie Carter Dawson stops smoking.
24        Fortunately, for some manufacturer, Malia Torgensen
25        stepped in.  What nobody's acknowledging about this

 1        whole conspiracy is not only will the product --
 2        when you use it as intended, it will kill you, but
 3        what they need is a replacement smoker to take
 4        their place on the timeline, and they don't have
 5        any problem with who's stepping in the timeline.
 6        They don't having any problem raving and applauding
 7        the fact that two minors stepped into the timeline,
 8        just like Jackie Miller and their mother did
 9        decades before.
10             The risk reduction again.  Dr. Burns did talk
11        about risk reduction.  So did Dr. Robicsek.  The
12        sad truth is your lungs never go back to normal.
13        You can reduce the relative risk.  They said it was
14        a relative risk, meaning if you compared yourself
15        to maybe your virtual twin who would keep smoking
16        at the same rate, you have reduced your percentage
17        vis-a-vis the person that continues.  But you
18        never, even after 20 years, ever become a never
19        smoke ever again.
20             Dr. Robicsek told you, when he goes into
21        lungs, they're permanently damaged.  Dr. Burns
22        explained it, the DNA is permanently changed.
23        Now -- so you can reduce your risk, no doubt.  But
24        essentially they want you to kind of guess what
25        would happened to Jackie Miller, but they proved it

 1        themselves when they used Dr. Burns' testimony and
 2        said, Look, if she would have quit just ten years
 3        earlier, '84, she would have reduced her risk of a
 4        smoking-related disease by 60 percent.  Sounds
 5        pretty impressive.
 6             When they said she should have stopped 15
 7        years earlier, 80 percent, that would have been
 8        basically around '80, '79, '80.  Sounds like a
 9        pretty impressive reduction, except what you heard
10        and they touted in the closing was, Jackie Miller
11        already had a smoking-related disease.  Smoking
12        cough they were talking about in the '80s, COPD and
13        the emphysema, she already had it.
14             Now, it's not the same as lung cancer.  And
15        perhaps she could have reduced her risk of cancer,
16        and that's why Mr. Anderson told you and we did
17        that we accept that Jackie Miller should have done
18        more in the '80s.  She did try to quit.  Now,
19        whether acupuncture's the way to go, who knows, but
20        she tried.  She tried again at her sister's
21        wedding.  There was an attempt.
22             For them to suggest that Jackie Miller giving
23        her daughter a cigarette after she quit somehow was
24        evident that maybe Jackie enjoyed it, made choices, 25        really flies in the face of any parent/child

 1        relationship.  Doesn't that really speak to the
 2        addiction, that it becomes such a part of you or
 3        part of her, rather, that you don't even think
 4        twice about what you've just done?  Giving your
 5        child another cigarette.  Did she really enjoy it?
 6        Did she really want to suck Michelle back in by
 7        giving her a cigarette?  Or did she really -- she
 8        didn't even think about it?  The cycle has taken
 9        hold, she's not even understanding, she's
10        rationalizing.  That's for you to decide.
11             But I would suggest it's not an all-or-nothing
12        proposition like everything Lorillard has proposed
13        to you.  Everything is either/or with them, all or
14        nothing, and it's just not.  The evidence supports
15        that it's not.  There's measurement and comparisons
16        that need to be made.  There is shared
17        responsibility.  There's shared fault.  We
18        acknowledge that.  They still haven't.  And that's
19        why they need to be punished.  That's why they need
20        to be deterred, because of this conduct, this
21        indifference, this continuing course.  This
22        position that they take with this jury because of
23        what happened to Ms. Miller, in the face of it, not
24        only screams to be compensated, but it screams to
25        be punished and deterred, to speak out.  It screams

 1        out that your verdict needs to be heard in
 2        Greensboro, North Carolina.
 3             Not only that you've taken away from three
 4        children, but you will not do this again.  Until
 5        they've been regulated, they've never changed their
 6        course of conduct.  They need to change the course
 7        of conduct.  That's why punitive damages are going
 8        to be warranted here, I would submit to you.
 9             I will say this about the questions they asked
10        every witness, Did you ever hear Jackie Miller say
11        she heard anything about -- from TIRC and even The
12        Frank Statement?  They never asked them, Did you
13        ever hear Jackie Miller say Lorillard told her she
14        should cut back?  Did you ever hear her say she saw
15        an ad from them saying we want you to smoke less?
16        No.
17             They made choices, too.  They made choices
18        throughout Jackie's life and her smoking but, you
19        know, this company has been in business for --
20        since 1760.  They were 180 years old or so when she
21        was a teenager choosing to smoke.  They have a life
22        that started before Jackie, during Jackie, and
23        after Jackie, not so with Jackie and her children.
24        And, honestly, to suggest that in one side of your
25        mouth that Jackie Miller was a wonderful mom who
4101 1        did everything she could for her children, who was
 2        equally loved, and then on the other side to
 3        suggest that at most you should fully compensate
 4        her children for $10,000 a year each, they're
 5        bartering with you.  Because what they're
 6        suggesting is you should give each -- and
 7        compensate each child less per year than what they
 8        paid their expert to come in here for.  The
 9        500,000-dollar man.  Eight years, $500,000.  Call
10        it ten years, 500,000 in ten years, and they would
11        suggest to you that the bond, the relationship, the
12        companionship, the protection, which nobody has
13        disputed, even them, should be equated to 10,000 a
14        year per child is simply ludicrous.
15             We're going to leave it to you, members of the
16        jury.  Consider the $500,000 they've paid him for
17        ten years.  Considering they pay 3 to 4 million for
18        the TI.  Some of you may think those numbers are
19        too much.  Some of you may think numbers like that
20        in a relationship that we've heard about are too
21        little, and that's why we trust your judgment.  But
22        Jackie Miller, no question, was a woman who went
23        beside herself for others.
24             Was there a better story than that wedding,
25        after everything she did, to have to worry about

 1        two more people with a birthday cake and that
 2        little girl and the corsage.  Does it speak volumes
 3        that the man that she divorced stayed in her life
 4        to the very end?
 5             THE COURT:  You have three minutes.
 6             MR. PATACCA:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 7             Members of the jury, you have been sworn in
 8        and you are the judges of the facts, just like as
 9        His Honor is the judge of the law, you are the
10        judges of the fact.  And I would submit today in
11        this courtroom in 2011 you're the most important
12        officials in the state of Florida to these parties,
13        the most important today for us.
14             You've taken an oath and we know you will
15        abide by the oath.  But for over 200 years in this
16        country, our constitutions of the United States and
17        Florida have allowed for jury trials to engage in
18        these disputes and settle them.  Think what might
19        have been, how many happy pictures you saw there
20        from 20, 30 years ago, how many more there would
21        have been for the next 19 years.  What could have
22        been if tobacco would have joined the Surgeon
23        General instead of shouting over him.
24             Thank you, Your Honor.
