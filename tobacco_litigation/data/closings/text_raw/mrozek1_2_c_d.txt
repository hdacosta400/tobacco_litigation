 1            MR. MOLONY:  Yes, Your Honor.
 2            Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  It's
 3       been a long couple of weeks of effort, and, first of
 4       all, I want to thank you again for the serious
 5       effort that you've put in throughout this trial and
 6       in your deliberations.  We thank you for your
 7       verdict.
 8            Obviously it isn't the verdict that I was
 9       hoping for, but -- and I'm sure that it is
10       absolutely something that all of you worked hard to
11       reach and gave a lot of consideration in coming to
12       that verdict.
13            My client takes this verdict very seriously,
14       and I can assure you that it's already been heard in
15       Greensboro, North Carolina, before I even get on my
16       feet to speak.  That's how seriously this issue in 17       this case in this matter is taken up there.  So to
18       the extent Mr. Patacca has been suggesting that that
19       would be something that ought to be achieved by your
20       collective voice, you've already done it.
21            With that said, what I need to do now and what
22       I would spend the next 40 or so minutes with you, is
23       addressing the punitive damages issue.
24            And, as Mr. Patacca has touched upon, the
25       decision that you've already reached is for fully

 1       compensating the family for the loss that the three
 2       adult children of Jackie Miller suffered as a result
 3       of her passing.  In this process here, the punitive
 4       damages aspect, as you'll hear when you see more
 5       specifically the jury instructions, is for the
 6       purpose of deterrence and for punishment, as has
 7       already been suggested.
 8            You've collectively already decided that the
 9       conduct here was sufficient, was bad enough to
10       warrant an entitlement to punitive damages.  That's
11       what you said by saying yes to the last question on
12       the verdict form.  And we hear that.  But the
13       additional money is not to compensate; it's for
14       simply deterrence and it's for punishment, as
15       Mr. Patacca has already suggested.
16            Now -- and the deterrence is for Lorillard in
17       the future and for others who may be paying
18       attention to this.  And I can assure you others are
19       paying attention to this proceeding, as well.
20            What I'd first like to suggest to you is, as
21       Judge Soud will point out to you when you get the
22       instructions, is that any additional amount that is
23       awarded here on punitive damages has to be based
24       upon harm suffered by the plaintiffs, not harm
25       suffered by the public at large.

 1            And given the fact that you've already fully
 2       compensated in your collective judgment the
 3       plaintiff for the loss that they've suffered, you
 4       know, I urge you to keep your focus on the
 5       instruction and on the harm that's to be addressed
 6       by your punitive damage award.
 7            Others who have claims such as this -- and
 8       you've heard allusions to it.  I mean, when we first
 9       got together for a jury selection process on the --
10       I guess it was almost three weeks ago -- it was in
11       conjunction with another proceeding at the same
12       time.  There are other cases.  You know that.  This
13       has come out of a class action situation.  This is
14       an individual case, as you know.
15            But my point is if others have claims like the
16       one that has been advanced here, well, very plainly
17       they can advance those on their own.  This case is
18       about Jackie Miller and her children and no one 19       else, as you well know.
20            Now, it's hard for anyone to -- to begin to
21       value the loss of a loved one, particularly a
22       parent.  And I know that was a difficult -- we
23       talked about it yesterday.  We talked about it in
24       earnest.  That's a hard thing for anybody to -- to
25       evaluate.

 1            But you have reached that evaluation and
 2       reached a conclusion in that regard.  And in this
 3       process here, just as there, sympathy for the
 4       family -- sympathy is not supposed to be part of
 5       your determination.  We all sympathize when somebody
 6       has lost a loved one.  But in determining what's
 7       fair and just in terms of an award of punitive
 8       damages here, just like before, sympathy has no
 9       proper role in a determination on the amount that
10       you collectively would decide to award against my
11       client.
12            I dare say, and he did a very good job of it,
13       the purpose of much of the argument you just heard
14       was to upset you.  And I would understand that it
15       did.  It upset me.  But anger is not supposed to be
16       the basis upon which you make any award.  Emotion,
17       anger, has no proper place in this proceeding.
18            Your verdict cannot, and the judge will point
19       that out to you very clearly, and I'm confident,
20       with the seriousness that you've done your work,
21       that your verdict will not be based upon an angry
22       response or soaring rhetoric.  It should be based
23       upon the instructions and the evidence.
24            Now, I haven't had very long to study your
25       verdict, but, obviously, you ruled against us on all

 1       counts.  So I hear that and, as I said earlier, the
 2       folks in Greensboro will hear that loudly, because
 3       you ruled against us across the board.  I dare say
 4       that ruling and the amounts are -- are a very loud
 5       voice, a very loud voice to me, a very loud voice to
 6       my client.
 7            It also suggests to me -- I spent much time,
 8       most of my time in the last couple of weeks before
 9       you, talking about Jackie Miller and talking about
10       her life and trying to do my best to present her in
11       a way that you would begin to know her and
12       understand her.  And by your verdict it suggests to
13       me that I -- while I may not have done as good a job
14       in that regard as I hoped, I certainly didn't do as
15       good a job as I had hoped to do in terms of
16       presenting my client in the light that I think is
17       most fair under the circumstances.  I should have
18       spent more time sharing with you what I submit is a
19       more accurate picture of my client than has just
20       been presented.  But that's a decision that I made 21       and that I'll have to live with in this -- in this
22       situation.
23            At any rate, what I'd like to do here is talk
24       about the evidence in Phase I to a certain extent.
25       And the first thing that I'd like to point out to

 1       you is that the wrongful conduct that has been
 2       advanced here as a basis for a suggested award of
 3       $18 million is conduct that no longer continues in
 4       any respect at Lorillard Tobacco Company.  To the
 5       extent that you want to send a message in that
 6       regard, to stop the conduct that has just been
 7       described for you in Mr. Patacca's presentation,
 8       that change has already -- has already occurred.
 9       That message has already been heard.  Those changes
10       have already taken place.  And I'd like to spend a
11       few moments going through some examples in that
12       regard.
13            As you know, Lorillard has been around a long
14       time.  It's been around since 1760.  And companies,
15       just like people, change over time.  Companies
16       change as their people change.  Lorillard prides
17       itself in having long-term line employees in
18       particular that work in their factory and, you know,
19       have participated in their manufacturing process for
20       years, but all of us sooner or later move along in
21       one form or fashion or another.
22            And in looking at the facts in this case,
23       Ms. Miller smoked her last Max cigarette a little
24       over 20 years ago.  And I bring that up because
25       we've been talking in this case about a huge expanse

 1       of time, huge expanse of time.  It started in the
 2       1940s with Lou Fink smoking cigarettes out on the
 3       stoop with Jackie Miller, and here we are all these
 4       years later.  Undoubtedly, inevitably, the face of
 5       the company and the people who run it change.
 6            And that's happened here.  Things are different
 7       now in a lot of respects than they were -- and a
 8       number of you-all are not as old as I am, but close
 9       to it.  Things are different than they were in the
10       1960s.  People are different than they were then.
11       And the people at Lorillard who made the decisions
12       50 and 60 years ago are different people than the
13       ones who are making the decisions today.
14            I wrote down some of the names as we were going
15       through Mr. Patacca's presentation.  Folks like
16       Curtis Judge, Mr. Kent, Mr. Yellen, Mr. Aki, who
17       wasn't mentioned today but whose memo was discussed
18       in both Ms. Leung's and Mr. Robinson's --
19       Dr. Robinson's deposition.  All of them are long
20       since gone.  They are no longer employed by the
21       Lorillard Tobacco Company.
22            Perhaps even more significantly, people like 23       Mr. Tisch, Dr. Spears, Mr. Orlowsky.  They're no
24       longer with the Lorillard Tobacco Company.
25            In short, the people who made the decisions,

 1       the people who were running the show, the people
 2       whose memos you've seen repeatedly, understandably
 3       but repeatedly, the names that you've become
 4       acquainted with, all of them are gone.  It's still
 5       called the Lorillard Tobacco Company, but it is a
 6       different company because the people who run it are
 7       not the same.
 8            You know, I have the same name as my
 9       grandfather.  We're two very different people.  And
10       companies, like generations of folks like ourselves,
11       change over time.  And this company has changed, and
12       it has changed about a decade ago, as I would like
13       to share with you a little bit about that right now.
14            One of the most significant changes is that
15       Lorillard readily acknowledges that Kent cigarettes,
16       Old Gold and Max cigarettes, when they still were
17       being made, caused cancer and can be addictive.
18       Obviously they were late coming to the party in
19       acknowledging that.  They should have acknowledged
20       that sooner.
21            The -- as Mr. Patacca points out, the Surgeon
22       General first came to -- changed the definition of
23       addiction in 1988 from its previous conclusion
24       in '64 that they weren't addictive, but Lorillard
25       and others held onto technical scientific

 1       distinctions too long.  Too long.
 2            But they don't hold on to those any longer.
 3       That has changed.  And it changed roughly about the
 4       year 2000.
 5            They should have said it earlier.  There's no
 6       denying that.  They had an overly technical view.
 7       And they should have said earlier that smoking
 8       causes lung cancer, as they've done in this
 9       proceeding and as they did roughly ten years ago
10       publicly.
11            So the two biggest issues that have been so
12       controversial for so long that have caused
13       litigation of this sort for quite a long time, those
14       changes occurred in the year 2000 when Lorillard got
15       a new chief executive officer and changed its
16       position in both of these important respects and
17       aligned itself, albeit belatedly, but aligned itself
18       with the public health community and continues to do
19       so in all significant -- in all respects.  There's
20       no qualification on that.
21            In the '40s through the '80s, as you know, we
22       didn't admit that it caused cancer and it was
23       addictive.  That's no longer the case.  Lorillard
24       has changed.  It now, as I've said, admits 25       unequivocally that smoking cigarettes causes cancer

 1       and other diseases and that cigarette smoking is
 2       addictive.
 3            You've heard a lot in this case about
 4       advertisements.  And while obviously I don't know
 5       the basis for your verdict because we obviously
 6       haven't -- we're not allowed to speak to you -- but
 7       in looking at that and considering the evidence in
 8       this case, the first thing -- one of the things that
 9       comes to mind is perhaps that the ads upset you.
10            Old Gold ads that were included, some were
11       before 19- -- they go back to the '30s.  They go
12       back, some, into the '20s.  Some of them were before
13       Jackie Miller was born.
14            But regardless, when you see ads that include
15       Santa Claus and puppy dogs, is that a bad idea?
16       Absolutely.  Would that be anything that could
17       possibly be done today?  Absolutely not.
18            The "greatest health protection" ads that
19       you've heard so much about that ran from roughly
20       1952 and they were stopped in 1955, they shouldn't
21       have run.  They shouldn't have run.  That was an
22       error in judgment.  I'm not denying that.  I'm not
23       debating that.
24            But I submit to you that punishing Lorillard
25       for ads that occurred 60 years ago, I would submit

 1       to you that's something that doesn't need to be
 2       deterred.  That's not something that needs to be
 3       corrected.  Because, as you heard from Ms. Leung's
 4       testimony, when the regulations were put in place,
 5       the changes occurred, the "greatest health
 6       protection" advertisements ceased.  And ever
 7       since -- and I tried to do some of this in my
 8       closing so that it wouldn't be lost in the shuffle.
 9       I went through each and every decade, and at the end
10       I outlined what the increasing regulation was in
11       each decade.  And there wasn't any evidence
12       presented as those regulations rolled on through the
13       years that suggested that Lorillard hadn't adhered
14       to the -- to the regulations as they unfolded.
15            I have a slide to show the -- to address the
16       advertising issue.
17            These are the restrictions on Lorillard's
18       marketing activities, much of which you heard about
19       in Ms. Leung's testimony, but it's been quite a long
20       time ago so I wanted to lay these out for you so
21       that you might recall them.
22            As you can see, Lorillard does not advertise
23       its products on non-Lorillard websites or on any
24       social media site.  Obviously in this day and age
25       technology is developing so fast.  I mean, when I
4236  1       was young we didn't have computers, let alone Tweets
 2       or any of the things that we have today.  We didn't
 3       have cellphones.  And so now social media, that's
 4       only been a very recent development, and Lorillard
 5       does not advertise on any social media website.
 6            "Our direct mail promotional materials only go
 7       to people who request it after they've been verified
 8       to be the age of 21."
 9            So really in order to obtain in this day and
10       time -- this obviously has been a big change -- in
11       order to obtain advertisements from Lorillard of
12       this sort, there's no longer an unsolicited direct
13       mail sort of thing.  It only goes to people who ask
14       them for it, and only after they're verified as
15       being over the age of 21, to make sure -- as Ms.
16       Leung said again and again and again, to make sure
17       that people who are underage don't receive materials
18       from this company having to do with the dangerous
19       product called cigarettes.
20            The next one is, "Lorillard has not advertised
21       on taxis, buses or other mass transit since 1998."
22       Again, a change, because obviously transit
23       advertising on buses or in public places like that,
24       you can't control who sees it.  And obviously in
25       public places you're going to have a lot of kids,

 1       young folks, that might be influenced by that.
 2            So that change occurred in '98.
 3            Likewise, Lorillard discontinued advertising on
 4       billboards in 1998.  Some of these are as a result
 5       of regulation, some of these are voluntary, but all
 6       of them are accurate.
 7            Lorillard has not handed out any promotional
 8       merchandise since 1998, the old thing of some of the
 9       companies with their gear.  There is no gear
10       anymore.  That's completely in the past and won't be
11       encountered or utilized again.
12            Year 2000, Lorillard became a major sponsor of
13       the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing and
14       supported "We Card."  Well, obviously that's an
15       effort, because as you know, companies like
16       Lorillard don't sell directly to the public.  They
17       sell to other people -- retailers, convenience
18       stores, groceries, you name it -- who then sell
19       directly to the public.
20            But that's our product.  And while, you know,
21       yes, you're in the business to sell the product that
22       you're making, you have -- you know, this is an
23       illustration, I would submit, of how Lorillard goes
24       about, and currently goes about and has since the
25       year 2000, trying to make sure that they only get

 1       into the hands of people who are old enough to make
 2       a mature and adult decision.  And that's what the  3       "We Card" program is all about.
 4            And what it does is it has certain penalties
 5       that kick in if somebody -- you know, they -- they
 6       monitor it, and if people are caught selling to
 7       kids, they have consequences.  Because it's a very
 8       serious thing with Lorillard to make sure that the
 9       retailers who are selling the product are
10       responsible in who they sell it to.  And that's been
11       around for the last ten, eleven years.
12            You've heard about sampling, the four-packs or
13       whatever, in days gone by.  As you can see from this
14       entry, Lorillard stopped its sampling program in
15       2002.  And that's seven years before the government
16       stepped in and required the company -- all of the
17       companies to stop doing so.
18            One of the points that I want to make is the
19       advertising climate is much different than when
20       Jackie Miller smoked her cigarettes that were made
21       by my client.  You could not ever again engage in
22       the kind of advertising that you've seen in this
23       case, whether they be for Old Gold or Kent or the
24       now defunct Max product.  That -- that -- that
25       date -- that day has come and gone.

 1            In terms of advertising, I think it's worth
 2       mentioning that Lorillard, in terms of a change of
 3       times -- Max is gone.  You heard Ms. Leung.  She
 4       testified that Kent is no longer advertised by
 5       Lorillard at all.  At all.  The sales have -- have
 6       gotten to a point where they don't advertise it.
 7       And Old Gold, which is the original brand that
 8       you've heard about, in fact, many, many years ago,
 9       they do almost no -- the only advertising there that
10       they do is little signs in the store where you can
11       buy them.  They don't do print, they don't do
12       anything, just a little point-of-sale stuff in the
13       store.
14            So when you consider, you know, the change over
15       time, the change, the reality is that 90 percent of
16       my client's business are cigarettes called Newport
17       that Ms. Miller never smoked, okay?  So, you know,
18       in terms of where they are as a company, how things
19       have changed with regard to the products that
20       Ms. Miller smoked, those -- those cigarettes, one's
21       gone, the other two are, as you'll see, not far
22       behind.
23            And they're not far behind because over the
24       years, notwithstanding the suggestion of the
25       braggadocios and the statements of now departed

 1       advertising persons that have been related by
 2       Mr. Patacca, the advertising campaigns of the
 3       Lorillard brands Max, Kent and Old Gold over the
 4       years have been a dismal failure.  And they've been  5       a dismal failure, and you can see that from the
 6       sales, as I'll address here in a minute.
 7            And the only point in saying that is that, yes,
 8       there was this spike many years ago because of the
 9       Readers Digest article, but over time all of those
10       marketing efforts by this company have been an
11       abysmal failure.
12            As Ms. Leung testified, Lorillard hasn't
13       advertised the Kent brand since 1992.  The evidence
14       early on when you couldn't read it because the
15       numbers were too little and we worked to try and
16       make them big enough so that you could read them, as
17       you'll recall, the Kent -- the entire Kent family --
18       which is not just Kent cigarettes; in more recent
19       years, I mean, they have something called the Golden
20       Light, and then I think it's called a Kent III --
21       that whole group combined, the evidence shows, is
22       one-tenth of one percent of the cigarette market.
23       The highest sales number that Max ever accomplished
24       was one-half of one percent.
25            That's the reason when I'm saying that when you

 1       consider those numbers, that over time these brands
 2       were certainly not successful because of
 3       advertising.
 4            Now, your verdict was against us on the issue
 5       of design.  You'll recall the testimony from
 6       Dr. Robinson.  It was to the effect that Lorillard
 7       did spend a great deal of time and a great deal of
 8       money trying, in conjunction with others, including
 9       Wynder and Hoffman, to come up with -- and the
10       Tobacco Working Group, which you've heard reference
11       to -- to come up with a cigarette that was safer, a
12       lower -- lower in tar, lower in nicotine.  Some of
13       the designs contemplated higher nicotine but lower
14       tar because the tar was considered to be the -- the
15       biggest problem.
16            And there were decades of Lorillard researchers
17       who engaged in the effort to try and lower the level
18       of tar in its products.  Lorillard did that because
19       there seemed to be a consumer demand for such a
20       product.  Nonetheless, recall that Ms. Miller only
21       smoked regular full-flavor Kent and Max.
22            My point is, in terms of those efforts,
23       Ms. Miller wasn't seeking -- we were trying to
24       develop something in those years.  We spent a lot of
25       years and a lot of time and a lot of money to try

 1       and come up with a cigarette that would be safer.
 2       And we did not succeed, nor really did anyone else.
 3            And that's part of the reason why, when I first
 4       came and addressed you at the outset, I said there
 5       isn't any such thing as a safe cigarette.  It isn't
 6       for lack of trying.  It isn't for lack of spending  7       money in an effort to accomplish that.  We did seek
 8       to accomplish that.
 9            But while we were seeking to accomplish that, I
10       think it worth mentioning that Ms. Miller never
11       sought out any product like that.  She never smoked
12       one of the brands like, for example, the Kent Golden
13       Light that would be directed to someone who was
14       seeking that kind of other product.
15            The name Max ought to illustrate what that
16       cigarette -- it was maximum, and that's what she
17       chose to smoke.  So despite all those efforts which
18       were aimed, I would submit, for the right reason,
19       trying to come up with a product that would provide
20       a safer cigarette for our consumers, our customers,
21       that wasn't something that Ms. Miller, by her
22       actions, seems to have, you know, been -- been
23       interested in finding.
24            In addition, you heard that Lorillard -- you
25       heard from Dr. Robinson.  Lorillard developed a

 1       product called the True Ultra I.  And the True
 2       Ultra I, as you'll recall, is a very low -- it's not
 3       completely denicotinized.  It is a product that is
 4       very low in nicotine.
 5            Again, try to come up with a product that will
 6       be safer for people to use if they want to purchase
 7       it.  And that was a product that was,
 8       coincidentally, test-marketed in Florida.  And
 9       notwithstanding a lot of time and a lot of money and
10       a lot of effort by the company to -- to do what I
11       would submit is something responsible in that
12       regard, the market, the consumer, didn't like it,
13       didn't purchase it, didn't want it.  It was
14       extremely low in nicotine.
15            Lorillard can produce cigarettes with different
16       levels of nicotine, as it did.  It can produce
17       cigarettes meeting different types of
18       configurations.  The problem is you have to have
19       something the consumer, if they're going to buy it,
20       what they want to buy, okay?  You can lead -- like
21       the old adage, you can lead a horse to water, but
22       you can't make him drink.  And Lorillard, by
23       developing products like the Ultra I, True Ultra I,
24       was trying to put something out there in hopes that
25       people would utilize that as a -- that they wanted a

 1       lower nicotine, a safer alternative.  Not that it
 2       was safe.  There wasn't any suggestion of that.
 3            I want to talk for a minute about -- a minute
 4       about additives, since we touched on that.
 5            As this slide depicts, Lorillard disclosed its
 6       ingredients in cigarettes.  Beginning in 1984,
 7       Lorillard began providing a list of its ingredients
 8       to the Department of Health & Human Services, and in  9       '94 it provided a list of its ingredients publicly
10       to the American public.
11            In the 1990, the late 1990s, Lorillard
12       published scientific articles reporting the results
13       of toxicological testing of ingredients in Lorillard
14       cigarettes.  Now, what does that mean?
15            It means, the first thing, three things, is we
16       told the government what was in cigarettes, whether
17       it was, you know, things to keep them moist, things
18       to make them less harsh.  All those things we were
19       providing to the government back in '84, and the
20       evidence is that the government never told us to
21       take anything out or off that list.
22            The list of ingredients have been made public
23       since '94, and they were -- there was testing that
24       was conducted, toxicological testing of those
25       ingredients in Lorillard cigarettes, and that has

 1       been provided as well.
 2            2000, Lorillard provided those publications
 3       about its testing to the National Academy of Science
 4       Institute of Medicine to facilitate research in the
 5       area of cigarette design.  Today Lorillard has a
 6       list of its ingredients on its website.
 7            So to the extent, by your verdict and your
 8       collective decision in this case, that there was
 9       anything about ingredients that might have
10       influenced you, this is to show you that we are
11       doing the publicly the right thing, I would submit,
12       in the area of ingredients.  It's transparency,
13       letting people know what's going on.  We've never
14       been asked to remove anything, as I've said.
15            Now, the Lorillard Tobacco Company, I want to
16       remind you, while it's been around a long time, it's
17       only a small player in this -- in the cigarette
18       industry.  It's 13 percent of the entire market.  So
19       comparatively this is a relatively small company in
20       Greensboro, North Carolina, compared to our
21       competitors.  I wanted to at least put that in
22       perspective to you because I hadn't spent any time
23       really talking much about the company and what it
24       is, what it's about, about the people that work for
25       them and the people that have worked for them and

 1       continue to work for them this day, particularly
 2       those that are in their -- their manufacturing
 3       facility.
 4            Now, one of the other areas that I wanted to
 5       address is CTR and TIRC, which you know is the
 6       research funding organization that set up the timing
 7       and the distribution of the Frank Statement.
 8            You also heard, as I wrote them down as
 9       Mr. Patacca was making his presentation and
10       referenced Dr. Burns and the tobacco industry -- 11       Tobacco Institute and the TIRC.  There's no reason
12       by your verdict to deter those entities because they
13       no longer exist.  They haven't existed since 1998.
14            And even though he had less than laudatory
15       things to say about the TIRC in the quotes that
16       Mr. Patacca provided, you might remember that in his
17       testimony Dr. Burns agreed that the TIRC funded
18       research by many distinguished scientists from top
19       universities -- Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and the top
20       schools in Florida -- and that the results of that
21       research were published in peer-reviewed literature
22       and in the Surgeon General's reports.  Whatever you
23       may have found that CTR and TI did that contributed
24       to the injury to Jackie Miller won't ever happen
25       again to anyone else because they no longer exist.

 1            Each passing decade, as I tried to show you
 2       yesterday as we rolled through the many years on my
 3       time line -- each passing decade brings greater
 4       recognition of the tobacco industry, and that
 5       continues unabated.
 6            There's no dispute -- we've not been crit- --
 7       we are criticized, and properly so, for not having
 8       responded sooner, but there hasn't been any evidence
 9       that suggests that we haven't complied with
10       government regulations each step of the way.  And
11       that continues and will continue, obviously, in the
12       years to come.
13            There's no dispute we did as we were told.
14       When they told us to change the ads in 1955, we did.
15       When the Surgeon General back in the '60s said he
16       wanted input, we provided it, that green monster,
17       the 6,000 studies and other assistance and
18       information that was provided.
19            We were told beginning in 1966 to put warnings
20       on the packs and later to put warnings on the ads.
21       We complied.  When Health & Human Services -- you
22       can take that down -- wanted the list of
23       ingredients, we provided that.
24            Needless to say, I think you already know it,
25       we're operating in a more restrictive environment,

 1       and we're doing all that we can to comply with the
 2       laws and rules governing the sale and marketing of
 3       the cigarettes.  And by that I mean we strictly
 4       comply.  There's no question about it.  It's too
 5       important.
 6            We make cigarettes which are, as we said at the
 7       outset, we talked at the onset, a very controversial
 8       product, has been for more than a hundred years and
 9       continues to be, notwithstanding the -- the warnings
10       that are on the packs, the disclosures that are
11       made.
12            And I -- and they'll -- the point that I want 13       to make is that Congress has made a decision that
14       we've talked about a number of times, and that is,
15       like with other dangerous activities, that
16       cigarettes, so long as they're sold to adults with a
17       proper warning on them, that collectively as a
18       society we have come to the conclusion that they
19       ought to be allowed to be sold.
20            And notwithstanding everything else that I've
21       said, I just want to make the point that we should
22       not be punished just because we sell cigarettes.  It
23       is a dangerous product.  It is a legal product.  And
24       that's -- as we've said since the outset, since jury
25       selection, that's not what this case is supposed to

 1       be about.
 2            Lorillard sells its products in full compliance
 3       with the laws of this state and of the United
 4       States, and you should not punish Lorillard for
 5       having made the choice to continue to sell a product
 6       that is legal in this country.  And I urge you that,
 7       as much as I said other things that my client did
 8       shouldn't have been done because it wasn't right,
 9       punishing Lorillard for selling cigarettes or
10       continuing to sell cigarettes wouldn't be right,
11       either, because it's legal in this country.  And,
12       you know, we have to respect the decision of all of
13       us and of -- and of our elected officials in that
14       regard.
15            Now, Lorillard today, as compared to the '40s,
16       '50s, '60s, and so forth, as I've tried to share
17       with you, is a different company.  It's a different
18       company for all the reasons that have been
19       expressed.  It's a different company because the
20       people who run it, the people who make the
21       decisions, those are all different than they were
22       back then.  The controversial issues have been
23       addressed and have been corrected.  The laws have
24       become more extensive and the regulations have
25       expanded and there has been compliance with all of

 1       them.
 2            Now, you've been asked here -- so my point in
 3       all that is that in terms of deterrence at least --
 4       there are two things here, punishment and
 5       deterrence.  Deterrence, given the fact that all
 6       these changes have taken place, given the fact that
 7       the issues that have been addressed again and again
 8       in these proceedings have been corrected, I would
 9       submit to you that this company has already been
10       deterred.  It has already changed its behavior.  It
11       has already changed its culture.  It has already
12       changed its conduct, okay?
13            Punishment, in terms of the loss, the serious
14       loss that Ms. Mrozek and her family has suffered, by 15       your verdict you have fully compensated them, okay?
16       Fully compensated them.  That's what your verdict
17       addresses, and certainly you spoke very loud in that
18       respect in reaching your collective judgment there.
19            Mr. Patacca has suggested that you should award
20       $18 million collectively in punitive damages in this
21       case.  And he suggested that, and in doing so did a
22       very effective job of, I would submit, generating
23       emotion, generating anger, whipping you into
24       something of a frenzy.
25            But, as we said earlier, anger and emotion

 1       isn't what you're supposed to decide a case like
 2       this and an issue like this on.  Instead, it's
 3       supposed to be an award that is a reasonable and
 4       objective number that is based upon the injury to
 5       Mrs. Mrozek.
 6            And to that end, although I didn't have much
 7       time to consider it, I gave some thought to what I
 8       would submit from my perspective would be a more
 9       appropriate way of dealing with this issue.
10            In your Phase I verdict, you decided that
11       Ms. Mrozek's damages were $6 million plus funeral
12       expenses.  That's the number that you-all
13       collectively thought would make Ms. Miller -- excuse
14       me -- Mr. Miller, Ms. Mrozek and Ms. Torgensen whole
15       for the loss of their mother.  But in doing so you
16       assigned 35 percent of the fault to the late Jackie
17       Miller and 65 percent of the fault to Lorillard.
18            On the issue of punishment, if you feel the
19       need to punish Lorillard, then what I suggest that
20       you do is that you award Ms. Mrozek and her brother
21       and sister the equivalent of the other 35 percent,
22       which is of course the percentage of fault that
23       you've assigned to Jackie Miller.  That's a $2.1
24       million figure.
25            Under the facts of this case, I would submit to

 1       you that that's a more rational number that is based
 2       on the injuries that Ms. Mrozek, her brother and her
 3       sister have suffered in this case.  And it's a
 4       number that makes them whole and, importantly, by
 5       doing so, it puts 100 percent of the responsibility
 6       of her passing on us, on Lorillard.
 7            And that I would submit that under all the
 8       circumstances, given the changes in the company's
 9       way of doing business and all the other
10       circumstances, giving us 100 percent of it, well, it
11       would speak even more loudly still.  But I would
12       submit that that's the most appropriate resolution
13       under these circumstances.
14            Now, when I sit down, and it's going to be
15       soon, you're going to hear that that's not enough.
16       Others who feel they've been harmed by Lorillard can 17       sue for themselves.  This case, again, is not for
18       punishing for harm to other people.
19            Any money that you award here, as I trust you
20       already know, is money that the plaintiff will
21       receive on top of the money that you have already
22       found is owed to Ms. Mrozek, her brother and sister
23       to make them whole for their compensatory damage
24       claim.  What I am suggesting is an amount that would
25       go on top of what you've already determined.

 1            Let me -- let me end this with an analogy.  I
 2       grew up in Kentucky, and I had an uncle who had a
 3       farm with mules, and from that connection got to be
 4       around them probably more than I cared to be.
 5            Mules, as we all know, are legendary for being
 6       stubborn.  And sometimes, in order to get the mule
 7       off the dime to do something and to get him moving
 8       in the right direction, you need to smack him on the
 9       rump, smack him hard.
10            But once the mule starts moving in the right
11       direction, does it make sense to chase him down and
12       whack him again because in days gone by he wasn't
13       moving in the right direction, he wasn't moving
14       where he should have been in the past?
15            As I hope I've been able to convey to you, in
16       the last decade Lorillard as a company has been
17       moving in the right direction to align itself with
18       the expectations of society, of its citizens, and
19       the public health community at large.
20            Mr. Patacca says rather eloquently that you
21       should send a large punitive damage award in order
22       to send a message and thereby be heard in
23       Greensboro.  Well, that message came over a decade
24       ago, and that's what prompted all of that change.
25       We've already changed.  And, believe me, by the

 1       verdict that you have already rendered in this case
 2       you've already been heard in Greensboro, North
 3       Carolina.  Whacking Lorillard again and again isn't
 4       necessary.  We've been whacked already by your
 5       verdict.  To do so, I would submit, serves no real
 6       purpose.
 7            And, ladies and gentlemen, punishment without a
 8       purpose should not be permitted in this court.
 9       Punishment without a purpose isn't justice; it's
10       revenge.
11            The message I respectfully suggest that you
12       should send with your verdict, not just to Lorillard
13       but to any other company that is engaged in this
14       business, is to tell them, Step up to the plate,
15       take responsibility for your actions and, by doing
16       so, you'll be treated fairly.  You won't be whacked
17       again and again and again with the same thing.
18            And I submit to you we have stepped up to the 19       plate.  We have made the changes.  You have been
20       heard, and you have been heard very loudly.
21            And with that I have to sit down.  My time is
22       about up.  I won't be able to speak to you again
23       because that's the way our system operates, as you
24       know.  The plaintiff gets to go last, and I won't be
25       able to respond to anything that Mr. Patacca says.

 1            But I -- but I hope that you understand how
 2       much we appreciate the hard work and the time that
 3       you've put in away from your family and the serious
 4       way that you've taken your efforts here collectively
 5       as a jury.  I thank you on behalf of the Lorillard
 6       Tobacco Company, and I bid you a good afternoon.
 7            Thank you.
