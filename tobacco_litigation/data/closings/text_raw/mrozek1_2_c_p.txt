 8            MR. PATACCA:  -- counsel.
 9            Members of the jury, we thank you for your
10       patience while we were with the Court.  We thank you
11       for deliberating.  And now let me get to it.  Let's
12       move again.
13            Ms. Cheney, P-15, please.
14            Let me start with Dr. David Burns, who devoted
15       his entire life and his work to the pulmonary system
16       and tobacco health with the Surgeon General.  I'd
17       like to remind you, if you could, when you're
18       considering how to punish and deter and send a
19       message to Lorillard, consider what he told you in
20       this courtroom here in Jacksonville, Florida.
21            P-16, please.
22            "In your opinion, Doctor, did they fulfill the
23       promises that they made in the Frank Statement? 24            "No, they did not fulfill those promises, and
25       the communication to the public respectfully [sic]

 1       and substantively misrepresented what the scientific
 2       community knew to be scientifically untrue, and they
 3       used the research funding, many of it funding
 4       interesting and appropriate studies, but they used
 5       it to suggest that the causes of lung cancer
 6       remained an open scientific question.  They used it
 7       to investigate other causes of cancer besides
 8       cigarette smoking.  And they used it to encourage
 9       individual scientists to participate in developing
10       research for purposes of litigation."
11            He was there for decades.  He saw.  And he told
12       what they knew, when they knew it, and what they
13       failed to do about it.
14            But we don't have to just rely on Dr. Burns,
15       although that would be enough.  We can look at
16       Lorillard's own documents.
17            224, Ms. Cheney.
18            Members of the jury, when you go back -- I know
19       you had all the evidence.  I know you've gone
20       through it.  But if you wanted to look, this is
21       LP_2690, 2690 on those tabs that you saw in one of
22       the books.
23            Let's go -- this was in 1974.  This was
24       Dr. Spears to the then head of Lorillard.
25       Dr. Spears had not yet ascended to the throne, but

 1       he was a chief chemist throughout.
 2            Let's go to Bates Number Page 3, and let's go
 3       to the highlighted portion.
 4            He's talking about the CTR.  The CTR was part
 5       of what was developed from the Frank Statement.
 6            "Their promise to America, promise to smokers,
 7       We're going to do something about this for you.
 8       We're going to get to the bottom for you."
 9            Dr. Spears candidly, in an internal,
10       confidential memo, when you go back and look,
11       confidential, right on the front, not public
12       dissemination, describes what CTR was doing.
13            "Historically the joint-industry-funded smoking
14       and health research programs have not been selected
15       against specific scientific goals but rather for
16       various purposes such as public relations, political
17       relations, position for litigation, et cetera.  Thus
18       it seems obvious that the reviews of such programs
19       for scientific relevance and merit in the smoking
20       and health field are not likely to produce high
21       ratings.
22            "In general, these programs have provided some
23       buffer to public and political attack of the
24       industry as well as background for litigious
25       strategy." 4200
 1            Internally, 23 years before he took the stand
 2       in this case and still denied that their products
 3       caused disease, he was acknowledging internally why
 4       we're really setting up CTR, and not only why we're
 5       setting it up, that he knows we're not likely going
 6       to produce any high ratings of science that are
 7       going to be beneficial to this company.  He had the
 8       gall in 1997 to testify as he did.
 9            Now you know why we're here.  Now you know what
10       Dr. Roberts didn't know when he took the stand here
11       yesterday -- or Monday, rather.
12            Can we go to P-17, please?
13            Dr. Burns continued, "Did the" -- and I'm going
14       to abbreviate -- "TI or the TIRC or any of the
15       cigarette manufacturers at any time in the 1950s" --
16       again, we're talking about the Frank Statement --
17       "state to the general public that there were
18       carcinogens, carcinogenic compounds in cigarette
19       smoke, that they felt at that time" -- "at the time
20       were impossible to remove?
21            "No, they didn't.  And as a matter of fact,
22       they made the opposite statements on the news shows,
23       which included statements that if any compounds were
24       identified that were toxic, they would remove them."
25            And of course you know over the past two weeks

 1       they didn't do that, did they, despite their
 2       knowledge.
 3            P-18, please.  Dr. Burns continued.
 4            "Again, Doctor, was anyone in the cigarette
 5       industry communicating to the public that they felt
 6       that smokers had a necessary requirement for
 7       nicotine?"
 8            That's what I was talking to you about Jackie
 9       in the hospital, the hospice.  The need; not the
10       want, the need.
11            "No.  Again, they were making the opposite
12       statement, which was that cigarette smoking was an
13       individual choice and free choice behavior rather
14       than one that was driven by the need for the
15       ingestion of the nicotine."
16            The disease needed to be fed.  And they were
17       denying it then and they would continue to deny it
18       for decades, and they would continue to insult the
19       Surgeon General when he would state otherwise.
20            We move on into the advertising and marketing.
21       P Number 19, please.  Dr. Burns can tell you about
22       his perspective on that.
23            "Doctor, people who were in their teenage years
24       in the '40s, 1940s and 1950s, were they exposed to
25       far more examples of the kind of imagery that you're

 1       talking about than perhaps would be true today?  2            "Yes, they were most certainly exposed to far
 3       larger amounts of advertising on television and
 4       radio.  And once the advertising on television and
 5       radio ceased, it was replaced by a dramatic increase
 6       in advertising in magazines and other forms of print
 7       media.  So people who were adolescents in the '40s
 8       and 1950s would have received a much higher
 9       frequency of exposure to very powerful tobacco
10       advertising images."
11            And we all went through in this courtroom and
12       saw examples of that, specifically from Lorillard,
13       advertising to the teens in the '40s and '50s, teens
14       like Jackie Miller.
15            Now, it was suggested to you in this courtroom
16       that Kent really did a bad -- or Lorillard did a
17       very poor job of advertising the Kent image, that it
18       was such a low piece of the market share.  Let's go
19       back to see the self-congratulatory pat on the back,
20       let's brag to the shareholders.
21            When you go back, you'll have an opportunity to
22       look at their annual report of 1953, which will be
23       Bates Number LP_714.
24            Ms. Cheney, I lost my reference to it, to my
25       year-end review.

 1            Yeah, the annual report of 1953.
 2            VIDEO TECHNICIAN:  This one?
 3            MR. PATACCA:  Yes.  Thank you.
 4            And let's go to Bates Number Page 4.
 5            Lorillard year review, 1954, when they were
 6       doing a horrible job of marketing Kent and you saw
 7       that flat-lined in evidence.
 8            Let's go to the -- under "Sales set a record
 9       high," the portion I've highlighted here, that
10       paragraph, please.
11            "Filter-tip cigarettes in 1953 doubled the
12       share of the market that they had in 1952.  Kent
13       doubled and redoubled its volume and showed the
14       greatest percentage of increase of any brand over
15       1952.  Shareholders will be interested to know that
16       normally it takes four or five years for a new brand
17       to get into the black," meaning positive income as
18       opposed to costs.  "Kent accomplished it soon after
19       we achieved nationwide distribution."
20            Now, thank you, Ms. Cheney.
21            As we go forward, again it was discussed that
22       perhaps Kent really didn't take off until after the
23       Reader's Digest.  And certainly it benefited and
24       they exploited that advantage.
25            But what did they know?  We knew about the

 1       mouse-painting studies in the early '50s that led to
 2       the Frank Statement, the first scare of the
 3       industry.  Scared them straight.  Let's get  4       together.  Let's issue the Frank Statement.
 5            But in 1963 and 1964 you heard evidence
 6       Lorillard conducted its own mouse-painting studies
 7       for 88 weeks over one year, starting in 19- --
 8       excuse me -- 1963 that lasted into 1964.
 9            I'd encourage you when you go back to look in
10       the binder that's marked Plaintiff's Exhibit
11       Number 23.  This will be LP_4601.  This is their
12       report on the mouse study, LP_4601, Exhibit 23.
13            For you and me, Ms. Cheney, 167.
14            They've been studying mice.  They've been
15       painting mice.  This is before the Surgeon General
16       was about to come out in January of '64, and the
17       study continued even after.  You remember they knew
18       it was coming, they criticized the Surgeon General
19       for the report in '64, saying that the science
20       wasn't even finished.
21            So what did they do?  This is the final report.
22       Its purpose was a study to determine the
23       carcinogenicity, causing -- the carcinogenic
24       properties for the skin of mice from certain tobacco
25       smoke in one of their fractions.

 1            And let's go to our Page 7, please.  Let's
 2       highlight that, the whole last paragraph.
 3            What did they find?  They painted their tar
 4       from the Kent cigarettes in addition to their
 5       competitors', and they painted it on mice.  And it
 6       didn't really matter whose cigarettes you used.  The
 7       overwhelming percentages of the mice were getting
 8       the tumors.  Eighty-eight weeks they studied the
 9       information that was essentially done more than a
10       decade, if not 20, 30 years earlier, and they were
11       coming up with the exact same internal conclusions
12       that were never shared.
13            Thank you, Ms. Cheney.
14            So let's put this in perspective what they're
15       doing.
16            If we could, I'd like to go to Number 153, an
17       exhibit.  This is Exhibit LP_1217.  It's in that
18       notebook, Plaintiff's Number 24.
19            It's a December 11, 1963 document.  This is
20       from Mr. Murray in advertising at Lorillard to
21       Mr. Yellen, who's the head of the advertising at
22       Lorillard at the time.
23            Let's go, if we could, to the first paragraph.
24            You have this document, LP_1217, Exhibit 24.
25            This is the end of '63.  They know the Surgeon

 1       General is about to publish a month later.
 2       Everybody knows it's coming.
 3            Now, they know they have been conducting this
 4       mouse study.  It's already started.  It goes
 5       88 weeks.  It will end, as we see, we just saw, in  6       the fall of '64.
 7            So now they're saying, "With the expectation of
 8       adverse publicity," the Surgeon General, "in the
 9       forthcoming release, I'm wondering if we should take
10       the matter in an aura of defeatism and acceptance or
11       if we should utilize the assets at our command and
12       do something that would be timely and in keeping
13       with good business."
14            To kind of steal and use the word from
15       Dr. Roberts, not just aware, but should we now start
16       to accept?  Should we accept what's going on in
17       this?  Absolutely not.
18            Let's continue, if we could, please.  Next
19       paragraph.
20            "Throughout the country there exists a very
21       definite belief or opinion that all of the
22       cigarettes on the market" -- "of all the cigarettes
23       on the market, Kent filters best."
24            Again, let's contrast that with Dr. Roberts.
25       There is awareness and there is belief, and they

 1       know, and they're about to capitalize on the fact,
 2       that people believe Kent is the best.  They know it
 3       and now they want to pretend like, Well, that's not
 4       our fault.
 5            "We cannot say so" -- you remember yesterday in
 6       closing I showed you in 1955 they got their hands
 7       slapped for being in the cookie jar with
 8       advertising.  The FTC said, You can't say that.
 9            So now internally we cannot say so, but
10       nonetheless the opinion still exists strongly.  The
11       marketing that they did in the '50s that they got in
12       trouble for is still carrying over.  People still
13       remember, even if they can't cite what the
14       advertisement is, even if they can't say, I remember
15       the ad, there's something still going on where
16       people still remember Kent is the best, it's the
17       greatest protection in health in cigarette history.
18            Here we are in 1963 and they're riding the
19       wave, if you will.  In Jacksonville we've got
20       surfers out on the beach doing it all the time.
21       They're riding the wave out here in Greensboro,
22       North Carolina.  And they're nowhere near the ocean
23       here.
24            Next paragraph, please.
25            "In a recent concentrated sampling campaign, we

 1       witnessed repeated instances where consumers read
 2       our message on the Kent 4s" -- you remember in the
 3       Kristy Leung depo she said Kent 4s, those are the
 4       little sample packs; you get four in a pack.  They
 5       went out -- the army of representatives went out and
 6       gave them away -- "and were most impressed by its
 7       contents, to the point of voluntary comment and  8       discussion which reflected the belief that Kent
 9       filters the best."
10            Now, despite what Dr. Roberts wanted to tell
11       you, the people on the street still believed that
12       they were safe.  It was a belief they put out on the
13       street more than ten years earlier and people still
14       remembered it.
15            That's how powerful their reach was in America.
16       That's how powerful their reach was to Jackie
17       Miller.  That's how powerful advertising works.  You
18       may not even remember where you saw it, where you
19       got it from, but when you walk away and use the
20       product, you remember there's something about it
21       that makes it the best.  That's power.
22            Next paragraph, please.
23            "Numerous consumers remarked they had formerly
24       smoked Kents, and in a vein that seemed to indicate
25       they didn't quite know why they were not still doing

 1       so.  Our people report noticeable increase in Kent
 2       sales recently that might indicate concern of the
 3       brand being smoked due to current trends and
 4       publicity."
 5            Current trends and publicity was they were
 6       starting to get the next scare from the Surgeon
 7       General.  People were starting to talk about the
 8       awareness that the issue was coming up again.  And
 9       what are they doing?  They're gravitating to their
10       product, and they're getting the benefit of it.  And
11       now they want to complain that, No one really
12       actually heard our message about Kent.  It was
13       pretty flat.
14            No.  Very powerful message that lingered on for
15       decades.
16            Next paragraph, please.
17            Short sentence.  It says it all.  "All of this
18       is intended to point up to the fact that Kent has an
19       advantage that we should utilize."
20            Next paragraph, please.
21            "When the Surgeon General's report is released,
22       it will doubtless have an impact on the public" --
23       no doubt people are going to want to hear; that's
24       what they're basically saying -- "if for no reason
25       than its air of officiality, coming from a United

 1       States Government agency.  It will further serve to
 2       create doubt and confusion in the smoker's mind and
 3       leave him with a desire to seek safer means of
 4       continuing to smoke.  If the reputation of Kent
 5       means anything, there should be a strong trend
 6       towards the brand."
 7            Doubt and confusion.  The company that marketed
 8       it knew what they were about to face.  The public
 9       was starting to be doubt- -- remember that little 10       discussion I had, I tried to bring up?  They're
11       yelling over the kid's head in the classroom at the
12       teacher, You don't know what you're talking about.
13       You're biased.  And the smoker's sitting there
14       listening.  Doubt and confusion.  I want to trust
15       the one, but I feel like I should trust the other.
16            That's the message they intended, that's the
17       message that they got, and they shouldn't be
18       surprised that's what occurred.
19            Next paragraph, please.
20            "My thinking is that we should be prepared on a
21       moment's notice to launch the heaviest and most
22       concerted sampling campaign on Kent 4s that we have
23       ever undertaken so as to reach as many smokers as
24       possible."
25            This is the kind of language they used when the

 1       British were coming.  On a moment's notice, be ready
 2       to get out in the middle of the night and we will go
 3       attack.  And they weren't talking about on a
 4       moment's notice let's get out there and join the
 5       Surgeon General.  What if they were to join the
 6       message?
 7            But, no, the army was ready differently.  "On a
 8       moment's notice, let's launch the heaviest and most
 9       concerted campaign," not information for the good of
10       Jackie Miller, a campaign to keep them smoking.
11       Let's get the Kent 4s in their hands.  Let's reach
12       as many as we can, reassure them, undermine their
13       motivation that they want to quit when they hear the
14       Surgeon General.
15            That's what they intended.  That's what they
16       got.
17            What did they know?  This is when they knew it.
18       And what did they do with that information?
19            Next paragraph, please.
20            "Upon the release of the report," Surgeon
21       General's report, "our people should drop all other
22       activity and conduct the sampling exclusively for at
23       least a solid week, and I would estimate that by a
24       concerted effort they could reach as many as 2,000
25       customers per day."

 1            Business, I mean, all business, should drop.
 2       Everybody drop everything and hit the door.  And now
 3       we know why it was the greatest health issue in the
 4       twentieth century.
 5            Next paragraph.
 6            "I realize that this may be seeming to be
 7       waving the red flag at the bull, but I do feel" --
 8       "do not feel," excuse me -- "that people are going
 9       to stop smoking but are going to seek a means of
10       smoking in a safer way.  And with the reputation
11       existing on Kents, they could be most easily 12       persuaded to turn to our product."
13            What did they do with the information they had?
14       People were going to seek a way of smoking in a
15       safer way.  Health-conscious smokers in 1960.
16       Again, in 2011 that sounds ludicrous.  Back in 1963
17       and '64 it was probably whacky, but it worked.  It
18       worked back then.
19            And what are they going to do?  They're not
20       going to help the people quit, if that's what their
21       concern is.  We're going to help them switch.
22       That's what they intended.  That's what they did.
23       And when the people did it, they shouldn't come into
24       this courtroom and be surprised.
25            Next paragraph, please, I believe on the next

 1       page.  Yes, we're going to the next page.
 2            Let's blow both of them up.
 3            "The mechanics of such an effort can be worked
 4       out but should be set up so as to be placed in
 5       effect in a timely manner inasmuch as timing is of
 6       great importance.  It is felt that when confusion is
 7       rampant, a word of assurance is the factor that
 8       stabilizes the situation and has lasting effect."
 9            This is the exact same stuff you heard from
10       Dr. Werner.  She wasn't talking about marketing.
11       She was talking about addiction and disease.  You
12       need to reassure, play upon the disease, reassure
13       the smoker what they're doing is okay.  I know
14       you've got your doubts.  Come to the Kent.  Come to
15       the greatest protection.  Without ever saying the
16       words.  And they know their marketing has lasting
17       effect.
18            Thank you, Ms. Cheney.
19            This, of course, tied into the document we
20       talked about yesterday, which is Number 165, which
21       is in Exhibit 25.  It's LP_659.  You may have seen
22       it again.
23            1964.  Now Mr. Yellen, who was head of our
24       advertising in that last document, is now reporting
25       to the throne here as to what's going on.  And we

 1       talked about this yesterday.
 2            Let's go down to the body, if we could.
 3            This was the "how did we get here" memo, what
 4       are we doing, what are we doing with the information
 5       we have.
 6            And let's go a little further.
 7            You may recall he's described there's a
 8       definite relationship between selling the
 9       merchandise and the corporate profits.  That's why
10       in Lorillard's annual report, they've said in the
11       past, that advertising is a top management-level
12       decision.
13            And let's go to the body. 14            You may recall this is where they were talking
15       again about the safer cigarette concept, the
16       awareness of the consumer that Kent is the safest,
17       and how it was some innocent third-party Readers
18       Digest threw it out there, but, yes, we need to
19       exploit the advantage, exploit the smoker, bring him
20       in-house.  And when they did, they did such a poor
21       job of marketing Kent at Lorillard that they went
22       from four billion cigarettes to 38 billion annually
23       in less than two years.  Four billion to 38 billion.
24            Thank you.
25            Now, we talked -- you were told a lot about how

 1       there's never -- no one ever remembered Jackie
 2       Miller actually seeing the ads, and we talked about
 3       how her words and actions probably could tell you
 4       that she saw things from Max, saw things from Kent.
 5       But let me remind you of some testimony that Kristy
 6       Leung, the advertising and marketing representative,
 7       told you.  And go by your memory and what your notes
 8       were.
 9            But the question was asked, "Is it Lorillard's
10       position, yes or no, that advertising is a factor in
11       maintaining brand loyalty among its customers?"
12            Answer:  "I would say that the company believes
13       that, and that is why we spend money in order to
14       advertise and promote our products."
15            Question:  "You don't ordinarily hear people
16       say, you know, I like that ad for Kleenex so I'm
17       going to buy Kleenex.  Now, that's just not how
18       advertising works, is it?"
19            Answer:  "I don't know if people actually talk
20       that way to other consumers, but I think that
21       certainly someone may see something in an
22       advertisement and think that, That product is
23       appealing to me, I'd like to try it."
24            Question:  "And they wouldn't necessarily turn
25       to their spouse or their best friend and say, Gee,

 1       that ad really persuaded me.  I think I'll go buy
 2       that product, right?"
 3            Answer from Kristy Leung, corporate
 4       representative of Lorillard Tobacco Company:
 5       "Probably not."
 6            I'm running short and I have plenty more to say
 7       to you, but I really wanted to keep this to
 8       30 minutes here.
 9            THE COURT:  You have until 3:35 on your first.
10            MR. PATACCA:  On my first, Your Honor?  Okay.
11       Thank you, Your Honor.  I was losing track of where
12       I was on my time.
13            I'm still going to not take up extra time of
14       yours.  I'm still going to move along.
15            So Ms. Leung, as we're talking about, was asked 16       a different question at a different set of her
17       depositions.  Again, go by your memory of the
18       evidence, because you are the judges of the facts.
19            But -- question:  "But people do rely on ads,
20       and that's why Lorillard seeks to be truthful and
21       factually accurate in its advertising, right?"
22            Answer:  "I think that people have a right to
23       believe what they see in an ad is truthful.  And
24       that's -- the FTC is charged with making sure that
25       advertising is factually accurate."

 1            We talked about how the FTC had to make sure
 2       they were accurate several years earlier.
 3            Now, the question to that was:  "And does
 4       providing factually accurate information in an
 5       advertisement always tell the whole story about the
 6       product?"
 7            Her answer was, "No."
 8            "My question is:  Wouldn't you acknowledge that
 9       an advertisement can be perfectly truthful and
10       factually accurate but still fail to convey the
11       information that might be important to people
12       exposed to that advertisement?"
13            "Yes."
14            "Lorillard agrees that consumers deserve to be
15       told the truth, right?"
16            Answer:  "Yes."
17            Now, why did I bring that up?  I'm going to
18       give you an example.  Again, we're in the '60s, '64.
19            Number 917, please.
20            This is in Exhibit 22 that you have back there.
21            Here's their ad in 1964.  The mouse study that
22       they've done is now completed.  They've sent out the
23       army.  They dropped everything.  The Kent 4s have
24       been thrown out.  Now they're advertising in LIFE
25       magazine, 1964 -- excuse me.  The mouse painting is

 1       in the middle.  It doesn't finish until the fall.
 2            "No medical evidence or scientific endorsement
 3       has proved any other cigarette to be superior to
 4       Kent."
 5            Factually correct.  Not one misstatement on the
 6       facts.  They're right, there's no medical evidence
 7       or scientific endorsement that can prove another
 8       cigarette is superior to Kent.  But when you read
 9       that ad, using your common sense, what does that
10       suggest to you?  That Kent is the safest.  And not
11       only that, it omits and doesn't tell America not
12       only is it no safer, there is no safe cigarette.
13            Hundred percent factually accurate and, yet, it
14       omits the information.
15            Yesterday I told you they can't know who was
16       going to get the cancer and who would not or who
17       would be addicted and not.  And that's why it was 18       important.  You must give all the information so
19       consumers like Jackie Miller can protect herself.
20            That ad speaks the factually correct and yet
21       omits the whole other side of the story.  This is
22       like Dr. Roberts in this courtroom came in with just
23       part of the story, and I'm sure all factually
24       correct as to what he wanted to say, but had no
25       context through the entire story.

 1            Thank you, Ms. Cheney.
 2            So let's talk about, again, what they knew and
 3       what they were continuing to do.
 4            Again, in 1972 -- Number 212, please.
 5            The Surgeon General, who would love to
 6       acknowledge them for helping, has no idea that once
 7       again he's getting criticized.
 8            Let's blow this up.
 9            This was on January 10, 1972.  This was in
10       conjunction with that one TV clip that we showed
11       Dr. Roberts on one of the evening news programs.
12       Mr. Kloepfer came on and said -- was talking on that
13       clip.  That was a separate clip, but it's from this
14       press release.
15            Here they are in 1972.  Now we've gone eight
16       years later than what we just talked about; eight
17       years.
18            "We believe that the number-one problem is the
19       extent to which these officials knowingly mislead
20       the American public.  The Surgeon General's
21       statement that 'There is no honest disagreement'
22       among experts on effects of smoking is false.  It is
23       a gross insult to the scientific community.  It
24       ignores the work of researchers cited in his own
25       report.  It ignores the work of researchers which is

 1       misrepresented in his own report.  It ignores the
 2       work of researchers which is inexplicably absent
 3       from his own report."
 4            Doubt and confusion.  Trying to reassure
 5       smokers that the story is not ended.  Trying to
 6       take -- although, as Dr. Roberts would say, there's
 7       some awareness, they're trying to make people lag
 8       behind.  Don't believe.
 9            That's shouting over the students in the room
10       at the teacher.  That's reprehensible.  That's
11       unacceptable.
12            As you know, that didn't stop, because in 1988
13       they continued.  In 1988 is when the Surgeon General
14       came out and said that smoking is actually
15       addictive.
16            Number 55.  You'll see this in LP_2108 in your
17       tabs.
18            We talked about this a couple times, about how
19       they were saying the Surgeon General's report is 20       irresponsible and scare tactics, but I wanted to
21       share with you a part that we didn't read yesterday.
22            Let's go to the middle, Ms. Cheney.
23            They're talking about the Surgeon General --
24       and the part above it, also, please.  Let's go to
25       both paragraphs, "The claim" -- yeah.

 1            The Surgeon General is now telling America that
 2       essentially this is like a drug, it's addictive.
 3       And they're -- and they're criticizing him.
 4            "For the Surgeon General to state it's a drug
 5       similar to cocaine, heroin or alcohol is
 6       irresponsible," they say.  "To convey this message
 7       is to invite disaster."  I'm not sure to whom.
 8       Perhaps to them, not the smokers.
 9            I'll continue.
10            "And to trivialize the serious drug problem
11       faced by society."  The Surgeon General is
12       trivializing, in their opinion, the drug problem in
13       America by giving health information that they would
14       not give.
15            They're worried about the young people in this
16       report, this press release.  "If young people
17       believe the government and equate this addiction" --
18       I'm paraphrasing; I know you're reading along with
19       me -- "with smoking, how will they understand the
20       true horrors of drug use and withdrawal?  If instead
21       one recognizes the report for what it is, a biased
22       'scare tactic,' then what credibility will be given
23       to the reports by the government on real drug use?"
24            Ludicrous.  Reprehensible.  Unacceptable.
25       Irresponsible.

 1            That's why Dr. Roberts told you in his
 2       deposition at the end of 2010 that, It was only
 3       about a month ago that we would finally admit that
 4       nicotine is a drug.  Because they know they're
 5       wearing the baggage of messages like this.
 6            They already said the Surgeon General is nuts
 7       for saying it was a drug.  How dare they equate
 8       addiction of -- to drugs to our products?
 9            That's why.
10            Thank you, Ms. Cheney.
11            Let me -- let me start coming to a close,
12       please.  I'd like to, you can imagine, talk to you
13       quite further, but you've heard the evidence.  You
14       have all the evidence.  I've tried to give you some
15       examples of why what this company did deserves your
16       attention and why, when you go back for the second
17       part of your verdict, you should get their
18       attention.
19            It is only through a verdict in this case in
20       this phase that you will get the attention of
21       Greensboro, North Carolina, where Lorillard is, 22       plain and simple.
23            We've seen repeatedly the company only acts
24       when it's told to act.  They didn't disclose
25       ingredients until they were told.  They didn't give

 1       warnings until they were told.  They were promoting
 2       the health benefits of Kent cigarettes to smokers
 3       like Jackie Miller until they were told to stop.
 4       They wouldn't agree that it was addictive until long
 5       after they were told.
 6            And we saw and heard from the three executives
 7       on the stand, even late into the '90s, the last
 8       hold-outs, if you will, they couldn't even admit it
 9       caused disease, even after they were told.
10            So only can you, as a jury, assessing the
11       evidence and giving them their fair day in court,
12       tell them it's time to change.  The purpose of
13       punitive damages is to punish and deter.  Your first
14       verdict was just to compensate that which was lost.
15       Punitive damages have to go beyond, if you decide to
16       award them, to punish and deter, to tell, to tell
17       Lorillard and those who they agreed with it was
18       unacceptable, it was irresponsible, it was
19       reprehensible, and what you did to Jackie Miller
20       through your actions cannot be tolerated.  It was a
21       reckless disregard for her safety.  You were grossly
22       indifferent, consciously indifferent.
23            What I would suggest to you, Your Honor --
24       members of the jury, as our judges of the facts, is
25       that you consider the harm that they caused Jackie

 1       Miller, as you must under the law.  And how should
 2       you do that?
 3            I would respectfully request that you consider
 4       all the evidence, the few things I pointed out here
 5       today, all you heard in closing and all the evidence
 6       back there, and take the verdict for Jackie Miller
 7       and her family -- you've come back and said
 8       $6 million and $905 for funeral expenses -- take the
 9       600 [sic] million, do it again, the $6 million again
10       for the family, do 6 more million to punish them,
11       and then do 6 more million to deter.  18 million
12       more.  For the family, to punish, and to deter.
13       Because clearly and convincingly you've already
14       found punitive damages should be awarded.
15            And that will tell Greensboro, North Carolina,
16       Lorillard Tobacco Company, that you have judged
17       them, you have given them their day in court, you've
18       considered the harm they did to Jackie Miller and
19       her family, and that would be a just reward.
20            They don't change until they're told to.  They
21       have never changed until they were told.  Speak with
22       your verdict today in Jacksonville, Florida, and let
23       them hear it. 24            Thank you.


 2            MR. PATACCA:  Yes, sir.
 3            May it please the Court, counsel.
 4            Members of the jury, for the last time I
 5       address you in this entire proceeding.  Let me say,
 6       in case I was less than clear, what we're doing here
 7       is punishing and deterring.  You've already
 8       compensated.  So anything I might have said that was
 9       misconstrued to give more money for compensation, I
10       didn't mean to say it that way.  We're here to
11       punish and deter.
12            But I would suggest you still take the
13       6 million for what they knew, for when they knew it
14       and what they did for it.  That still gives us the
15       18 million that I told you about.  Again, that's in
16       your discretion.
17            But let's talk about what you've heard here
18       from Lorillard.
19            Part of the argument is that your verdict has
20       already been heard loud and clear.  Part of the
21       argument was that others that were listening have
22       heard, not just Lorillard.  But you've heard no
23       evidence that the industry that wouldn't even hear
24       from the Surgeon General has now somehow heard six
25       members of a jury in Jacksonville in less than

 1       30 minutes and somehow that has made a difference.
 2            I would suggest to you go by the evidence in
 3       this case and the evidence that affected Jackie
 4       Miller.
 5            You were told that Lorillard only has about
 6       13 percent of the overall market.  If you want to
 7       punish and you want to deter the others that are
 8       supposedly listening, then with your proper verdict,
 9       coming back with that amount tells them this is what
10       the Jacksonville jury did in Jackie Miller's case
11       with the evidence it heard on the member that only
12       had 13 percent of the share.  That will speak loudly
13       to the others, if they are listening, for
14       deterrence.
15            Part of the argument was, We don't need to be
16       punished.  Compensation was enough.  But, again,
17       just like I didn't want to be misunderstood, that is
18       just to compensate what was lost.  There must be
19       punishment, and by your verdict already you
20       determined there should be punishment and there
21       should be deterrence.  Just like the parent who 22       catches the child in the cookie jar and the child
23       says, But I won't do it again.  Of course that's
24       what they say.
25            When you make a decision that there must be

 1       punishment, it must be carried out.  Otherwise what
 2       message are you sending?  If the verdict in this
 3       case is no punishment and no deterrence, that will
 4       be heard loud and clear by Lorillard and others.
 5       That will be equally heard loud if you do not punish
 6       and you do not deter.
 7            Lorillard repeatedly tells you, as the law
 8       requires, that you can only punish and deter for the
 9       harm that Mrs. -- that was suffered by Mrs. Miller
10       and her family.  And that is the law, all that
11       conduct that harmed her and her family because of
12       her death.
13            And, yet, in the next voice, they want to
14       explain to you why there's no need for deterrence,
15       no need for punishment, because now they are a
16       different company, that somehow things have changed.
17            So when they don't want to be punished, they
18       say, Well, you can only look at what happened to
19       Jackie.  But when they want to avoid deterrence and
20       punishment, they really try to pretend like Jackie's
21       not in the picture, it had nothing to do with
22       Jackie.  And it had everything to do with Jackie.
23            And I would submit to you that all those
24       members that they talked about, the Kents and the
25       Akis and the Spears and the Tisches and the

 1       Orlowskys, everybody who has now left, has no
 2       bearing upon what you do here today.  Did they --
 3       they didn't give you evidence of why they left.
 4       Were they fired because of the mistakes, or did they
 5       retire because of their service?
 6            Give you an example.  In 1993 you heard the
 7       deposition of two of the heads of Lorillard who
 8       still denied that smoking caused cancer.  Then you
 9       heard in 1997 Dr. Spears' testimony.  He was not the
10       president before '97.  He wasn't in '93 when the
11       others were speaking.  The very year that Jackie
12       died, he was not the president, from '93 to '97.
13            And what did they do to the man who was part of
14       the four decades before that denied it caused
15       disease and still denied and spoke against the
16       Surgeon General?  What did they -- did they punish
17       him?  Did they deter him?  No.  They promoted him.
18            This is about Jackie.  It is too late for
19       Jackie.  It was too late in 1994.  She never heard
20       the words, We're a different company.  And, yet,
21       they want to use that with you.
22            That's why punishment and deterrence must
23       happen.  If you do not punish and you do not deter, 24       that will be heard loudly.
25            Just like I said about Lorillard before, that's

 1       what they intended.  That's what happened.  Should
 2       there be any surprise?  If you do not punish and you
 3       do not deter, it will happen and there will be no
 4       surprise.
 5            They just don't get it.  They will -- they want
 6       you to consider it as a new company and a new day,
 7       but who did we hear from?  We heard from two people
 8       that they, the corporate management, said please
 9       speak on our behalf, Dr. Robinson and Kristy Leung.
10       Remember their testimony.  Consider it.
11            Every time Dr. Robinson was asked a question
12       about, "Why did you do things back then," he was
13       evasive.  For instance, "Why" -- "Why were you
14       worried about low tar if you didn't believe low tar
15       made a difference?"
16            And it was never about Lorillard.  His answer
17       always was, "Well, that's what the public health
18       officials wanted."
19            "Well, why did you make the product" -- "That's
20       what the consumers wanted."  Never, never, ever
21       about Lorillard.
22            My point being, if the new company that is
23       before you today, that claims it's before you today
24       was truly new, with a new policy and a new
25       direction, they had their opportunity from their

 1       corporate representatives who were here in 2010 and
 2       2011 to tell it like it was.
 3            I gave you an example yesterday about Kristy
 4       Leung.  Instead of saying, yes, mistakes were made
 5       on the youth marketing in the era when Jackie was a
 6       youth, she wouldn't even admit that.  Instead of
 7       admitting, Yes, those were changes that were -- that
 8       were wrong, but it's different now, she didn't say
 9       that.  She just said, We don't do it.  We don't
10       study it.  We don't market it.  Different day, same
11       song.
12            I would -- I would submit to you that you have
13       no evidence to suggest -- other than being regulated
14       and told what to do, there have been no changes in
15       the mentality and the intent of the company.  The
16       only difference is now they want to be applauded
17       because they follow the law, the unique position of
18       a citizen who says, I stop at the red lights.  You
19       should reward me.
20            The Max cigarette that they say was just -- I
21       guess now defunct, that's what she smoked.  That was
22       the message they were putting out.  We talked about
23       it in the trial.
24            1337-4.
25            You've seen the ad.  They wanted -- they wanted 4266
 1       their smokers to continue smoking, smoke fewer but
 2       by smoking longer, knowing that people compensate.
 3       And that's what Jackie went to.  They came up with
 4       the slogan, "It's whacky but it works."  And pretty
 5       much everything we've talked about in this case in
 6       retrospect seems whacky, but it works.  The
 7       advertising which seems whacky by today's standards
 8       worked.  To even debate the Surgeon General back
 9       then seems whacky, but it worked.
10            Telling a jury in 2011 that, It's changed, and
11       trust us, you don't have to punish us, you don't
12       have to deter us, that's whacky, but don't let it
13       work.
14            They never, ever told their smokers, Don't
15       smoke.  In fact, when the smokers really got to the
16       point where they started questioning, they came up
17       with a different slogan.  They just moved on.
18            2244.
19            This was in their True ad.  Remember you heard
20       about this in the case.
21            "I said to myself, either quit or smoke True."
22       And that was their -- that was their answer to when
23       people really started turning the tide.  That's the
24       new management.
25            Members of the jury, it would be just for you

 1       to speak -- speak loudly, as I suggested.  They made
 2       business decisions, not -- not just poor judgment,
 3       but business decisions for a decade that were based
 4       on the bottom line, and that's the way they sold it.
 5            792.
 6            There's the Kent.  "The difference in price is
 7       just a few pennies" -- you actually had to pay more
 8       for it -- "but the difference in protection is
 9       priceless."
10            To Kent -- to Lorillard, selling Kent was
11       priceless, and they knew that the people that were
12       seeking its protection, they were priceless.  And to
13       the family of Jackie Miller, she is priceless.  And
14       that's why what they did that caused harm to her, it
15       would be just, it would be fair to punish still.  It
16       would be fair and just to deter the others who are
17       supposedly listening.
18            It was suggested I worked you into a frenzy
19       emotionally.  I don't want you to come back with a
20       verdict based on emotion.  Like a parent who talks
21       to their child and says, I love you and I'm very
22       angry about what's going on, you take a breath and
23       you say, I'm doing this with your good in mind and
24       you are going to be punished.  And that's the proper
25       way it's handled.

 1            So I'd ask you to go back to the jury room, and  2       on the off chance, which I don't believe I did, I
 3       angered anybody or incited anybody, take a deep
 4       breath, come out, just like a jury's required to,
 5       weighing the evidence and considering the law, and
 6       dispassionately, without prejudice or sympathy for
 7       either party, tell them what you must with no
 8       emotion attached to it, but a message that speaks
 9       louder.
10            I'll close with this.  Dr. Roberts told you
11       about one of the scientists who, back in the '60s,
12       said, You could shout from the rooftop that
13       cigarettes were dangerous -- essentially is what he
14       said -- and you wouldn't be saying anything that
15       everyone didn't already know.
16            Well, apparently he didn't realize you could
17       shout from the rooftop of a company in Greensboro,
18       North Carolina, and either they didn't know or they
19       didn't want to know.  Today I would ask you to shout
20       from the rooftop so everybody will know.
21            Thank you.  On behalf of Michelle Mrozek, Malia
22       Torgensen, their brother Robert Miller, and for
23       their mother Jackie Miller, we appreciate all the
24       attention you've given us.  And I'm going to sit
25       down.
