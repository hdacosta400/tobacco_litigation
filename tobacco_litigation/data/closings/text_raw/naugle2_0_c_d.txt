12             MR. MCCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
13             Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
14             This is my last chance I have to speak to
15         you and the last chance I have to say thank you
16         on behalf of Ms. Arnold and me for your service
17         in this case.  You were constantly paying
18         attention and note-taking and being here as our
19         jury to resolve the dispute we have between the
20         parties.
21             I also want to take the opportunity to thank
22         the folks who have helped Ms. Arnold and me with
23         this case, some of whom are in the courtroom but
24         other who have been stuck in the office the
25         whole time and so this is my chance to thank

 1         them as well, and I'm going to do that.
 2             I want to start off this morning the same
 3         way I ended yesterday, and that's to talk about
 4         the medical record I showed relating to
 5         Ms. Naugle's current health status.  That
 6         information may have been a shock to you because
 7         you had heard throughout the plaintiff's case
 8         from Dr. Coopersmith that Ms. Naugle had another
 9         six to ten years left.  But as long as there was
10         a claim in the case for 4 million dollars in
11         future damages, you needed the information.  And
12         I'm sorry if it had an emotional effect on you
13         and a shock, it's understandable if it did,
14         because it was new to you.  And you may wonder
15         how do we deal with something that happens right
16         at the end of the case like that where you get
17         that news?  Because we're lawyers here and we
18         fight it out with one another in I think a civil
19         way, but we're also human beings.  And we can
20         relate to how that must feel for you.
21             And so what I want to show you is a jury
22         instruction on how to deal with something like
23         that.  And it talks about, and you know this
24         from jury selection, the need not to decide the
25         case based on emotions or sympathy.  And that's

 1         what I'm focused on here is sympathy.  The
 2         instruction, in fairness, really tells you not
 3         to be a human being.  And you have to be a human
 4         being, but we have to do our best to set aside
 5         our feelings and you have a job that we're all
 6         being asked to do.
 7             My job today is to share with you what the
 8         evidence showed in the case and how it relates
 9         to the issues you're being asked to decide on
10         the verdict form.  That's my job today.  The
11         case will then be handed over to you after
12         Mr. Uustal gets to talk to you again, and your
13         job will be to do the best you can to decide
14         this case based on the evidence and the legal
15         instructions the judge gave you and only based
16         on the evidence and the legal instructions the
17         Judge gave you.  And I know you're going to do
18         the best at that and that's why we all
19         appreciate your being here.
20             One thing I want to do is I -- I'm going to
21         trip over this -- I want to start now with where
22         I started off in my opening statement.  Because
23         I told you in my opening statement that there
24         would be some issues in this case that just are
25         not in dispute at all, and you've heard a lot

 1         about these throughout the case.  I'm not going
 2         to cover them all.  But I do want to talk to you
 3         about the two bottom ones because you've heard a
 4         lot about this in the evidence.  I want to talk
 5         about what the issues are before you.
 6             Because you've heard a lot about
 7         Philip Morris over the years and different
 8         tobacco companies over the years and the Tobacco
 9         Institute and things that may have impacted the
10         public, things that did not have anything to do
11         with Ms. Naugle.
12             MR. UUSTAL:  Your Honor, I object.  The last
13         one that he's talking about is improper
14         argument.  You've already ruled on it.
15             THE COURT:  Can you turn the board towards
16         me?
17             MR. MCCARTER:  Sure.  I'm happy to put the
18         board down, Judge, if it's going to cause
19         controversy.
20             THE COURT:  You can put the board down if
21         you want.  You can use it if you wish.
22             MR. MCCARTER:  Well, then I'll use it.
23             THE COURT:  The objection is overruled.
24             Ladies and gentlemen, what the lawyers show
25         you, what they say is argument in the case.

 1         You're going to deal with the evidence in the
 2         case.  So stick to the evidence.
 3             You may proceed, sir.
 4             MR. MCCARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 5             The two issues for your decision in this
 6         case relate to compensatory damages and punitive
 7         damages.  The issue of fault or addiction or
 8         responsibility, as we've said throughout the
 9         case, has been decided by the first jury.
10             The second thing is this is just
11         Ms. Naugle's case.  And you're going to see jury
12         instructions on this.  When we talk about
13         reimbursement, compensation for medical bills,
14         it's just her medical bills that are at issue.
15         In addition, when we talk about pain and
16         suffering, that type of damages, it's just about
17         her.  It's not about other smokers.  And that's
18         also true with respect to punitive damages.
19         You're going to see in the instructions I'll
20         show you later that the claim for punitive
21         damages is based only on the conduct that harmed
22         her.  So if the conduct that you saw, much of
23         what you saw, I'd submit 99 percent of what you
24         saw were things that had nothing to do with
25         Ms. Naugle, that has nothing to do with punitive

 1         damages.  And I'm going to show you the jury
 2         instructions that talk about that.
 3             But this isn't a class action.  It's a suit
 4         by one person against one defendant.
 5             There's also other things now that are not
 6         in dispute and I want to talk about those as
 7         well.
 8             And I told you at the beginning of the case
 9         that on this first question on the verdict form
10         that we would agree that Ms. Naugle is entitled
11         to compensation for her medical bills.  I said
12         that in opening statement and I say it again
13         today.  And I said the only issue is how much,
14         what's the amount.  And plaintiff has put in
15         evidence of the medical bills.  And we agree, we
16         agree on the past medical bills, line A there,
17         that she should be awarded what they're asking
18         for, $466,389.66.
19             So when you go in the jury room, that's an
20         issue you can take off the table.  And if you
21         write that down that's what you can put on the
22         verdict, both of us agree.
23             Now, the future damages, when I was here in
24         opening statement I spent a lot of time on it
25         because I told you they'd be asking for millions

 1         and millions of dollars in future medical costs.
 2         And you saw last Friday that was an issue that
 3         was hotly debated between the parties and you
 4         saw a lot of what was being debated was
 5         Ms. Naugle's life expectancy.  And that's
 6         because her medical records showed as the trial
 7         began that she had been taken to the hospital
 8         with the flu, influenza virus, she was in
 9         critical, guarded condition.  She had been
10         intubated.  She was on a ventilator, and she
11         came off for a day, but she went back on.  And
12         that's what the evidence in the medical records,
13         which are in evidence, will show you over that
14         period of time.  That was a hotly debated issue,
15         now it's not an issue because of her current
16         condition and plaintiff withdrawing that claim
17         for 4 million dollars in future damages.  It's
18         not an issue anymore.
19             And what they're asking for is $100,000 to
20         $150,000 for future medical care, and it's not
21         all future, some of it is going a little
22         backward where we don't have the medical bills.
23         And that's an issue now, now that that's the
24         claim that we agree to as well.
25             So when you get to that question B on this

 1         verdict form, because she has been in the
 2         hospital for almost two weeks and, you know, I
 3         think the upper end of that $150,000 has some
 4         hope in it that she's going to live a little
 5         longer, and if it's fair to have that hope then
 6         give them the upper range of that, the $150,000
 7         for future damages.  And you can write that in
 8         as well.
 9             Now unfortunately that's where the agreement
10         ends between the parties.  Because they're
11         asking to award 6 million dollars in pain and
12         suffering.  And what has happened is they took
13         that 4 million dollars that they were asking for
14         in future damages --
15             MR. UUSTAL:  I object, Your Honor, that's a
16         comment on what we -- it's an improper argument
17         on how we've litigated the case, and it's not
18         true.
19             THE COURT:  Don't make speaking objections.
20             MR. UUSTAL:  May I be heard on this very
21         briefly?
22             THE COURT:  Come sidebar, please.
23             MR. MCCARTER:  I can rephrase, Your Honor.
24             THE COURT:  Strike the statement by
25         Mr. McCarter.  Disregard the comments and he

 1         will -- I'll sustain the objection and he will
 2         restart.
 3             MR. MCCARTER:  They were asking for 4
 4         million dollars in future damages, they're not
 5         asking for that anymore.  Now they're asking for
 6         6 million dollars in pain and suffering.  So I
 7         want to turn to that question on the verdict
 8         form here.
 9             And I say pain and suffering as shorthand
10         for the list here.  But 6 million dollars is an
11         amount that is excessive, unreasonable and not
12         supported by the facts or the evidence.
13             Let me start with the future.  They're not
14         asking for the 6 million for future pain and
15         suffering.  On that one there's no evidence of
16         Ms. Naugle in pain and suffering right now.
17         She's in the hospital.  There's no evidence as
18         to how long she's going to live.  So I think the
19         real dispute involves this 6 million dollars for
20         past pain and suffering.
21             There's no dispute that Ms. Naugle has
22         endured pain and suffering.  There's no dispute
23         about that.  None of us would want to have
24         emphysema.  No one would want to go through what
25         she's gone through in the hospital the last few

 1         months.  No question about that.  But 6 million
 2         dollars, 6 million dollars is an excessive
 3         amount to request and to award for pain and
 4         suffering in this case.  And let me start with
 5         telling you why.  Because counsel repeatedly
 6         referred to the fact that she's gone through two
 7         decades of this pain and suffering.  It is true
 8         that she's had emphysema since 1992, so that
 9         would be 21 years, but she's not had the level
10         of pain and suffering during that time period
11         that she's had more recently.  In fact, you saw
12         this on one of counsel's slides.  If you take
13         the period from 1992 to 1996 [sic], so the first
14         14 years of her having the condition, she was
15         able to go about her daily activities.  And I'm
16         not trying to minimize her condition at all, but
17         when you're asking for 6 million dollars for two
18         decades of pain and suffering the facts are
19         important.  So for 14 years she was able to go
20         about her daily activities.  She didn't have any
21         restrictions on what she could do.  She wasn't
22         on supplemental oxygen.  She could work a
23         full-time job, 43 hours a week.  And she could
24         drive herself around and do everything else she
25         was doing before.

 1             The last 7 years or so after 2006, from 2006
 2         until June of this year when she went into the
 3         hospital with her infection she still was able
 4         to work a full-time job, but she was on oxygen.
 5         So she was on supplemental oxygen since 2006,
 6         but she still could go about her normal daily
 7         activities.  She did have the hospitalization in
 8         2009, but she -- and she needed more help
 9         recently with groceries, heavy things like that.
10             But if you remember what Dr. Singer said, he
11         said, well, she really was fine during that
12         period with the exception of that
13         hospitalization.  Her condition did change this
14         year because in June 2009 -- I'm sorry, June of
15         this year she went to the hospital with a
16         Nocardia infection in her lungs, and that caused
17         pneumonia.  And she was in the hospital for 30
18         days, which weakened her greatly.  And then she
19         went into the skilled nursing facility where she
20         was for two months.  They thought she was doing
21         better and she came out and then she wound up
22         getting the flu, and then went in the hospital
23         and got the MRSA infection that you saw
24         yesterday that gave her MRSA pneumonia.
25             And so the period of time we're talking

 1         about for pain and suffering, it's not a 21-year
 2         period of time that she's been in this
 3         condition.  It's really since June of this year.
 4             Let me also talk about what the law is on
 5         pain and suffering, and you're going to get a
 6         jury instruction on this.  And this is important
 7         because the principle here, this applies to all
 8         the money they're requesting in damages, but the
 9         principle here is that you should award an
10         amount of money which fairly and adequately
11         compensates Ms. Naugle.  So this is about
12         compensating Ms. Naugle.  It's not about
13         compensating anyone else, only about Ms. Naugle.
14         And also what you're told in the instructions is
15         to be fair and adequate.
16             6 million dollars, you should ask
17         yourselves, would that compensate Ms. Naugle?
18         That's not compensation for Ms. Naugle, that's
19         more than compensation for Ms. Naugle.  Nobody
20         would want to go through what she's gone through
21         but 6 million dollars is excessive.
22             Now, counsel talked about pulmonary
23         rehabilitation earlier.  And in my opening
24         statement I talked about pulmonary
25         rehabilitation because I said it's an issue for

 1         you to consider on this question of pain and
 2         suffering.  Now, counsel talked about it in the
 3         context of the medical expenses.  And while I
 4         agree you could consider it in the context of
 5         the medical expenses, I'm not asking you to
 6         reduce those medical expenses that we talked
 7         about earlier in any way because of her failure
 8         to go to pulmonary rehabilitation.  But when
 9         you're asking for 6 million dollars in pain and
10         suffering, it's fair to ask were there things
11         that Ms. Naugle could have done, reasonable
12         things that might have avoided some of her pain
13         and suffering, might have reduced, mitigated
14         what she went through, and so we put in evidence
15         on pulmonary rehabilitation on that question.
16         And it is something that I would ask you to
17         consider on this question of pain and suffering.
18         And that's because, you heard this from
19         Dr. Singer and Dr. Coopersmith, but what
20         Dr. Singer said was something along the lines
21         of, this is the greatest thing we have going for
22         us for emphysema patients.
23             We showed you the medical records.  This was
24         during Dr. Singer's video.  You saw the medical
25         records where he had been urging Ms. Naugle to

 1         go to pulmonary rehabilitation since 1999, so
 2         for 14 years.  And I want to make clear I'm not
 3         being critical of Ms. Naugle for not going,
 4         because we all have the right to decide to do
 5         what we want to do.  Doctors tell us things all
 6         the time that they say we should do or we
 7         shouldn't do, and I bet there's none of us in
 8         this courtroom who ever has followed our doctors
 9         advice all the time.  She was free to make her
10         decisions.  The reason I'm raising this is
11         because they are asking for 6 million dollars in
12         pain and suffering.
13             And what the evidence is from both
14         Dr. Singer and Dr. Coopersmith, it's really
15         undisputed, that pulmonary rehabilitation --
16         Singer wanted her to go for two hours a week.
17         It would have improved her quality of life,
18         reduced her symptoms, increased exercise
19         tolerance, reduced anxiety, reduced the risk of
20         exacerbations.  Exacerbations are those
21         infections that put her in the hospital and
22         really caused the problems she was having.
23         Reduces the risk of hospitalizations and
24         increases life expectancy.  That's not disputed.
25         This came from Dr. Singer and Dr. Coopersmith.

 1             And you're entitled to consider whether, if
 2         Ms. Naugle had done as her doctor asked, she
 3         could have avoided or at least lessened some of
 4         the problems that are leading to the request for
 5         6 million dollars.
 6             Now, there was a statement earlier, and I
 7         think they played a clip from Dr. Singer where
 8         he was saying, well, he thought it was great
 9         that she was going to work, and nobody is
10         criticizing her for that, but you remember what
11         Dr. Singer said in the medical records was that
12         it would be nice if she could take a couple
13         hours off work to go to the pulmonary rehab.  So
14         obviously the work wasn't enough.  He wanted her
15         to do a little more.
16             And I'd ask you on this issue of pain and
17         suffering, not in relation to the medical bills,
18         but on this issue of pain and suffering that you
19         consider this issue of pulmonary rehabilitation.
20             So on this question 2 what I ask you to do,
21         I'm not asking that you fill in a specific
22         amount, but the $6,000,000 request is excessive
23         and unreasonable.  I'm asking you to look at the
24         evidence and use your best discretion to award
25         an amount that's reasonable in light of the

 1         evidence and in light of the purpose of this
 2         award, which would be to compensate, to
 3         compensate Ms. Naugle, not compensate someone
 4         else.
 5             Now, on this question, this is, as you know
 6         from being here, the next question on the
 7         verdict form relates to punitive damages.  And I
 8         think when you saw at the end of counsel's
 9         argument that they're asking for 24 million
10         dollars, I told you what this case is about from
11         their perspective; it's about a big punitive
12         damages award, that's what they want.  And
13         that's why Dr. Cummings was here for two and a
14         half days to testify and all their other
15         witnesses were whisked in and out as quickly as
16         possible, because what's important to them is
17         punitive damages.
18             Now, this is where the real dispute in this
19         case lies.  This is where Dr. Cummings'
20         testimony comes in and Mr. Jupe's testimony.
21         And you know from my opening statement I am
22         going to ask you to award zero for punitive
23         damages because by your answer to the first two
24         questions you will have fully and fairly
25         compensated Ms. Naugle for her injuries.  And

 1         for the reasons I explain in the rest of my time
 2         it is simply not necessary or appropriate to
 3         award more money in the form of punitive
 4         damages.
 5             Now, I want to talk about Dr. Cummings for a
 6         minute because he is their punitive damages
 7         case.  Remember Dr. Cummings came for about two
 8         hours after opening statements.  He was here the
 9         entire next day and the entire next day after
10         that.
11             Dr. Cummings goes around the state telling
12         juries like you the same story over and over and
13         over again.  It doesn't matter who the plaintiff
14         is to him.  It doesn't even matter who the
15         defendant is.  He shows the same old ads, the
16         same documents and the same videos in every
17         case.
18             Dr. Cummings, you heard he's been paid more
19         than 1 million dollars to testify in these
20         cases.  He might be doing his testimony here for
21         free, but he got paid for his testimony in 2009
22         in that trial.  And he's been paid in scores and
23         scores of other cases, more than a million
24         dollars total.
25             Dr. Cummings told you he believes he's in a

 1         war on tobacco and that he takes his war to the
 2         courtroom because his hope is to deplete the
 3         tobacco company's funds through litigation.
 4         That's his goal.  He told you he's rooting for a
 5         punitive damages award in this case, as he does
 6         in every case.  And he admitted that he's a
 7         biased witness.  He admitted that he's biased in
 8         favor of the plaintiff so he's not coming in
 9         here as someone neutral.  And I submit to you
10         that you can tell that from his demeanor and the
11         way he answers questions on cross-examination.
12         He's visibly perturbed and angry by the
13         questions.  He often doesn't give straight
14         answers and the question has to be asked
15         repeatedly of him.  And he changes his testimony
16         from trial to trial when he's under oath.
17         That's why we get those transcripts out from his
18         prior testimony to show that what he says is
19         different in different cases in which he
20         testifies.
21             And you saw when Dr. Cummings was here, he
22         got impeached, that's what we call it,
23         impeached, at least 15 times where what he said
24         to you at first was different from what he said
25         under oath to a different jury sometimes in as

 1         few as two weeks ago.  That's Dr. Cummings.  He
 2         is their punitive damages case.  He was the only
 3         one who addressed that issue for him.
 4             One of the things you get to do is to
 5         evaluate the credibility and bias of witnesses.
 6         You have the right to accept their testimony or
 7         reject it or do something in between.  You have
 8         the right to look at Dr. Cummings' testimony and
 9         his demeanor on the stand and how he behaved and
10         answered questions on cross-examination and the
11         inconsistencies in his testimony from trial to
12         trial and say, you know what, I'm going to
13         reject Dr. Cummings' testimony.  That's your
14         prerogative as jurors because you're sitting
15         here and you get to evaluate the witness.
16             So I'd ask you to keep that in mind when you
17         think about Dr. Cummings' testimony, think about
18         how much he's been paid, that this is a second
19         job for him, and how often he was trying to
20         change his testimony from what he said before.
21             Now, there are a lot of rules that apply to
22         punitive damages.  You heard those in the jury
23         instruction.  So what I want to do is go through
24         some of them, because I think what you'll see is
25         you have all the evidence plaintiff has shown

 1         you in the case, particularly through
 2         Dr. Cummings.  What you're going to see is that
 3         the rules are really going to narrow down what
 4         you can consider for punitive damages.  That's
 5         what the instructions do.  They're going to
 6         narrow down to specific conduct that harmed
 7         Ms. Naugle.  And the rest of it, the rest of
 8         what you've seen is going to be gone.
 9             So let me start with the first one.  And
10         you've seen this before, but this has the
11         complete instruction on this particular issue,
12         and that is, a prior jury found that punitive
13         damages were warranted against Philip Morris for
14         the conduct that harmed Ms. Naugle.  That's the
15         first reference to the first restriction here,
16         which is to the conduct that harmed Ms. Naugle.
17         You're in some ways taking a baton from the
18         first jury and you're looking at the conduct
19         that harmed Ms. Naugle and should you award
20         punitive damages, more money for punitive
21         damages in this case.
22             But the important part from my perspective
23         is that it's in your discretion to decline to
24         award punitive damages.  So this is not a
25         finding that requires you to award punitive

 1         damages.  It's up to you.  It's up to you to
 2         decide the amount, and that amount can be zero.
 3             Let's go to the next one.  This refers to
 4         the findings that resulted from the Florida
 5         Supreme Court 2006 decision.  This is what you
 6         were told about in the instructions.  There was
 7         a reference to that.  And it's important to
 8         distinguish between the findings made there and
 9         the findings made by the first jury in this
10         case, and I'm going to do that.
11             But you were read those findings, but here's
12         the thing, for punitive damages those findings
13         are completely irrelevant.  You're instructed
14         you must treat those findings as if they do not
15         exist.  So those findings are taken off the
16         table for punitive damages.
17             Here's another rule, and that is, this talks
18         about the findings the jury made here in 2009.
19         Remember there were findings on negligence in a
20         design defect.  Those findings are off the table
21         for punitive damages.  So again, what we're
22         seeing here is it's getting narrower and
23         narrower and narrower.
24             So what's left after the design defect and
25         negligence?  Well, the concealment, the finding

 1         of concealment is eligible for punitive damages
 2         and the finding that Philip Morris did acts in
 3         furtherance of an agreement to conceal, that's
 4         also eligible for punitive damages.  But
 5         negligence and issues having to do with the
 6         design of the cigarettes are off the table for
 7         punitive damages.
 8             Here's another important instruction,
 9         because if you disagree with me and decide to
10         award some amount of punitive damages you should
11         know that any award must bear a reasonable
12         relationship to the amount of compensatory
13         damages.  And they're asking for an enormous
14         amount of money, 26 million dollars for punitive
15         damages.  But the evidence in this case is in
16         terms of her medical bills.  The medical bills
17         add up to roughly $600,000.  Now, you also can
18         consider pain and suffering as compensatory
19         damages whatever you award, but the amount
20         they're requesting is off the charts.  It's not
21         a reasonable relationship at all to any of the
22         damages that would compensate Ms. Naugle.  And
23         so this is an important factor if you disagree
24         with me that zero is the appropriate number.
25             So talked about what's left.  What's left is

 1         the concealment claim and the conspiracy to
 2         conceal claim.  And this is the further
 3         limitation here.  There's two instructions on
 4         this; that is, "You may not impose punitive
 5         damages to punish Philip Morris for conduct that
 6         was not shown by clear and convincing evidence
 7         to have caused Ms. Naugle's emphysema."
 8             So in other words, conduct that had nothing
 9         to do with Ms. Naugle, statements that she did
10         not hear, advertisements she did not see, things
11         that did not impact her at all cannot be
12         considered for punitive damages.  So right away
13         you have to focus on, for punitive damages, what
14         was the conduct that harmed Ms. Naugle, because
15         that's the only thing that may be considered for
16         punitive damages.
17             And there's evidence in this case that, you
18         know, other people have been harmed from smoking
19         and counsel talked about numbers of people who
20         have been harmed from smoking.  "Any award of
21         punitive damages is solely for the injury caused
22         to Ms. Naugle and should not," should not,
23         "include punishment for harm suffered by other
24         smokers."
25             And I'd submit to you that that's only fair

 1         because Ms. Naugle is the only smoker in this
 2         case whose facts and circumstances are before
 3         you.  Any other smoker who's harmed and has a
 4         claim can file their own case and they can seek
 5         punitive damages in their own case.  So this is
 6         only about the harm to Ms. Naugle.  It's only
 7         about the specific conduct that harmed her.
 8         It's not about anything broader than that.
 9             So if I could sort of summarize what the
10         rules are.  The first jury found concealment by
11         Philip Morris and they found that Philip Morris
12         did an act in furtherance of the agreement to
13         conceal which harmed Ms. Naugle.  Those are the
14         two findings by the first jury.  Both relate to
15         Ms. Naugle and both are specific to
16         Philip Morris.  And to be eligible for punitive
17         damages it's not enough that Philip Morris did
18         it, it has to have been shown to harm
19         Ms. Naugle.  And so conduct that did not injure
20         Ms. Naugle cannot be the basis for punitive
21         damages.  That's sort of a summary of what the
22         rules that we've just gone through show.
23             Now, you've seen in this case a lot of
24         evidence, a lot of evidence of conduct that
25         really had nothing to do with Ms. Naugle.  You

 1         saw it again this morning, although it was
 2         whittled down from what Dr. Cummings showed you.
 3         You saw that Frank Statement from December --
 4         January 1954 when Ms. Naugle was 5 years old.
 5         She obviously didn't read the newspaper and
 6         understand it as a 5-year-old.  There's no claim
 7         she did.
 8             Even after I cross-examined Dr. Cummings
 9         about this they still came back and showed you
10         advertisements from 1948 about doctors smoking
11         Camels, before Ms. Naugle was born or when she
12         was an infant.  That obviously did not harm her.
13             They showed you advertisements for the
14         Philip Morris brand of cigarette from the 1940s.
15         She never smoked the Philip Morris brand and she
16         was an infant or not even alive yet at the time.
17             They showed you videos from people from the
18         Tobacco Institute.  There's no evidence
19         Ms. Naugle ever heard any of those.
20             They showed you the RJ Reynolds executive on
21         the Ted Koppel Nightline show.  There's no
22         evidence that she saw that.
23             They showed you again that testimony from
24         1994, the tobacco executives testifying before
25         Congress, that also could not have harmed

 1         Ms. Naugle because she already had emphysema by
 2         then and she had quit smoking.  She didn't start
 3         back up after hearing that testimony.  So that
 4         has nothing to do with Ms. Naugle as well.
 5             So I submit to you that the questions you
 6         need to ask yourselves in regard to this claim
 7         for punitive damages to really figure out what's
 8         at issue are things like, well, what was it that
 9         was concealed from Ms. Naugle?  When was it
10         concealed from her?  What are the facts and
11         circumstances relating to it?
12             And we're in 2013 now.  It's not the 1950s
13         or '60s or '70s or '80s or '90s.  Is there a
14         need today in 2013 to award additional money in
15         the form of punitive damages?
16             And so the first thing we need to talk about
17         is Ms. Naugle's smoking, because you have to
18         figure out, again, what was it that impacted
19         her.  And we've gone through this in the case,
20         but here are some important points to consider
21         on Ms. Naugle's smoking.  The first is that she
22         started smoking as an adult.  And that's on
23         there because it was legal for her to smoke and
24         it was legal for Philip Morris to sell
25         cigarettes to her.  It was legal for

 1         Philip Morris to sell those longer cigarettes to
 2         her as well.  All of that was legal.
 3             You heard the story about how she started
 4         smoking that one night in a nightclub when she
 5         was 20 years old with her friend and they wanted
 6         to look older and more sophisticated because
 7         they were underage at the time for drinking and
 8         they went to the vending machine and bought
 9         Benson & Hedges.  Well, what was it about that
10         purchase of Benson & Hedges that had to do with
11         something wrong that Philip Morris did?  Is that
12         what caused her to start smoking, the fact that
13         there were Benson & Hedges in the machine?
14         Submit the answer is no, because if there
15         weren't any Benson & Hedges she would have
16         smoked something else then.  And she would have
17         smoked anyway.  Well, why did she smoke
18         Benson & Hedges?  Because they looked elegant
19         and they were feminine, that's it, that's why
20         she picked that brand.
21             Remember Dr. Cummings went through some
22         marketing memos with you in which the people
23         said, hey, our advertising is working.  People
24         view this as elegant and feminine.  Well,
25         there's nothing unlawful or illegal about that.

 1         It was legal for Philip Morris to market
 2         cigarettes in a way that may have appealed to
 3         women, that they were feminine or elegant.
 4         There was nothing illegal about that.
 5             When she started smoking, Ms. Naugle also
 6         knew it could be hard to quit.
 7             Now, we have her testimony here.  This is
 8         what you heard read in when Dr. Cummings was
 9         here.  "Setting aside 'addicted,' that term,"
10         because she said she had not heard it was
11         addictive at the time.  Talk about that in a few
12         minutes.
13             "Before you started smoking in 1968, did you
14         already have an understanding that smoking could
15         be a hard habit to break?"
16             And she said, "I did not know."  And then
17         she said, "Oh yes, I did."  And she knew because
18         she had watched her father try to quit smoking,
19         so she knew that once you get started it could
20         be hard to quit.  She knew that before she had
21         her first cigarette.
22             By 1970, so for 23 of the 25 years she
23         smoked, Ms. Naugle believed, she believed
24         smoking was harmful for her.  Again, this is her
25         testimony.

 1             "You said about 1970.  We've established
 2         that back in 1970 you knew smoking was bad for
 3         your health.
 4             "Yes."
 5             That was her testimony.  She may not have
 6         known it the first two years of her smoking, but
 7         for the next 23 years she testified she knew it.
 8             She also had personal family experiences
 9         that educated her about the risks of smoking.
10         You heard this from her brother Jim Naugle.  Jim
11         Naugle was here going through some of the things
12         she has to deal with in her COPD.  And you
13         remember he said he's friends with Mr. Uustal.
14         And Mr. Naugle, Jim Naugle, was the guy who
15         suggested to his sister that she file this
16         lawsuit.  And even he admitted that by 1976 it
17         had become family knowledge that smoking was
18         harmful as a result of his father's heart
19         attack.  So that's family knowledge that
20         Ms. Naugle had as well.
21             And finally, Ms. Naugle was warned of the
22         very disease she would get, emphysema, seven
23         years before she got it.  And you may recall
24         that when she was diagnosed with emphysema by
25         Dr. Molinet she wasn't surprised about it

 1         because she had seen emphysema on the pack seven
 2         years earlier.
 3             So that has to do with Ms. Naugle's smoking.
 4         And the question is in light of the facts and
 5         circumstances of the evidence in this case,
 6         after you've already compensated her fully and
 7         fairly is it necessary to award more money in
 8         the form of punitive damages?  And I submit the
 9         answer is no.  And there are several reasons for
10         it.
11             The first is that it was, I mentioned this
12         earlier, but it was legal for Philip Morris to
13         market Benson & Hedges to an adult like
14         Ms. Naugle in a way that made the cigarettes
15         elegant and feminine.  And there's going to be a
16         jury instruction you'll get on this, but this is
17         it.  "The manufacture, advertisement and sale of
18         cigarettes are lawful activities."
19             So what Philip Morris did in regards to the
20         Benson & Hedges in 1968, the ones she smoked,
21         Philip Morris advertised the cigarettes,
22         marketed them and sold them to an adult,
23         perfectly legal to do.  And that's in the jury
24         instructions.
25             You'll also see in the jury instructions

 1         that after 1969 they cannot claim that the
 2         advertising somehow neutralized the cigarette
 3         warnings by making smoking look glamourous.  You
 4         heard a lot about that from Dr. Cummings, that
 5         the companies continued to advertise their
 6         cigarettes, not Philip Morris, Philip Morris
 7         doesn't advertise in magazines anymore.  But
 8         Dr. Cummings talked about this and you should
 9         know there can be no claim in this case for
10         punitive damages because Philip Morris
11         advertised the cigarettes as glamourous or
12         elegant or anything like that after 1969.
13             Second, and I'd submit to you this is the
14         most important piece of evidence relating to
15         punitive damages.  I submit to you it's the most
16         important, and that is the warnings.
17             Now, I think the size of my boards were made
18         fun of this morning, but obviously I wasn't
19         suggesting to you that the warning on the
20         cigarette pack is this big.  This is so you all
21         can see it.
22             This first warning was on the pack of
23         cigarettes Ms. Naugle got that night from the
24         vending machine when she was 20 years old.
25         "Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your

 1         health."
 2             It was on every cigarette she smoked up
 3         until 1970.
 4             Now, there was a suggestion this morning
 5         that Ms. Naugle, you know, the warning is so
 6         small she might not have seen it.  There's no
 7         need to speculate about this because Ms. Naugle
 8         testified that she knew this warning was on the
 9         first pack of Benson & Hedges she purchased.
10         She knew the warning was on there.  She did say
11         it said may be hazardous and so that caused her
12         to question it, but she knew the warning was on
13         there.  There's no doubt about it.  And
14         Philip Morris followed the law and put this
15         warning on the packs of cigarettes it made from
16         '66 to '70.
17             Now, it's this next warning from 1970 to
18         1985 that led Ms. Naugle to say, you know what,
19         starting in 1970 when the "may be" was taken
20         off, that's when I knew, that's when I believed
21         smoking was bad for my health, starting in 1970.
22         And this warning was the one she said gave her
23         that message.  This warning, Philip Morris put
24         it on every package of cigarettes Ms. Naugle
25         smoked from 1970 to 1985.  They followed the law

 1         and put the warning on as the law required, in
 2         the language, in the language Congress required.
 3             So the suggestion that Philip Morris by the
 4         way that this message was intended to convey,
 5         this warning was intended to convey
 6         Philip Morris' message, Congress is the one who
 7         sets the language on the warning, not
 8         Philip Morris.  Congress set the warning in 1966
 9         and again in 1970.
10             And then from 1985 on, including today,
11         these four warnings have been on, one of them
12         has been on every package of cigarettes
13         Philip Morris has sold in the United States.  I
14         know you know this, but there's the reference to
15         emphysema on there.  Ms. Naugle is being warned
16         of the disease she would get seven years before
17         she would get it.  This is why she said to her
18         doctor when she was diagnosed, I'm not surprised
19         that I have emphysema because I saw it on the
20         pack seven years ago.
21             These are important in the case because what
22         they're asking you to do is to impose millions
23         of dollars in punitive damages because
24         Philip Morris concealed information from
25         Ms. Naugle while at the same time Philip Morris

 1         put these warnings on every pack.  That's why
 2         it's important.  Every package of cigarettes she
 3         ever smoked in her life had a warning on it.
 4             And this is important as well, this is
 5         another instruction; that is, after July 1st,
 6         1969 Philip Morris had no obligation under the
 7         law to put different or additional warnings on
 8         its cigarettes than these.  So by putting these
 9         warnings on its pack and it's undisputed
10         Philip Morris did it at all times, Philip Morris
11         had no obligation to put something different on
12         there or something more on there and that's the
13         law you've been instructed on.
14             The other thing is, while information -- the
15         jury found information was concealed from
16         Ms. Naugle, information about nicotine and
17         addiction and the health risks of smoking have
18         been common knowledge for decades.  And
19         plaintiff's counsel seemed to agree with this
20         point this morning; and that is, there's been a
21         lot of information out there for a long, long
22         time about nicotine and addiction and the health
23         risks of smoke.  I spent some time going through
24         this with Dr. Cummings.  And I'm not going to
25         spend nearly as much time on it today.

 1             But here are some of the things you saw
 2         during the cross-examination of Dr. Cummings,
 3         going all the way back to Christopher Columbus
 4         and the fact that his shipmates could not quit
 5         tobacco even when their captain was telling them
 6         to stop, ordering them to stop, they said they
 7         could not do it, they were unable to quit.  So
 8         that's the first European experience with
 9         tobacco, and coming out of that experience is
10         the message that once you start on tobacco it's
11         hard to quit.
12             John Quincy Adams talked about being
13         addicted to smoking and also I think chewing
14         tobacco.  And he talked about smoking, if people
15         just stopped using tobacco there would be an
16         increase in longevity, a recognition that
17         tobacco use cuts short people's lives.
18             You heard about Mark Twain quipping about
19         quitting smoking is the easiest thing he's ever
20         done, he's done it thousands of times in the
21         1800s.
22             The Florida Health Notes talked about
23         cigarettes being the very worst form of
24         addiction.
25             Reader's Digest over the years talked about

 1         nicotine being a drug and the reason why people
 2         smoke and smoking being addictive.
 3             That's all in the public domain, not
 4         scientific journals, in the public domain.
 5             Now, I've put on here the '64 Surgeon
 6         General's Report and the 1988 Surgeon General's
 7         Report, and that's because you, as you know from
 8         the evidence, there was a scientific debate
 9         starting in 1964 about do you call smoking an
10         addiction or do you call it a habit?
11             In 1964 the Surgeon General said it's not an
12         addiction, it's a habit.  And the Surgeon
13         General said that because at the time
14         intoxication was part of the scientific
15         definition of addiction.  Remember that?
16             And then in 1988 the Surgeon General said,
17         we're going to use a different definition of
18         addiction, it's not going to include
19         intoxication and therefore they changed the
20         ruling from '64 and said it does meet the
21         scientific definition of addiction.
22             Before 1988 even Dr. Cummings admitted he's
23         not aware of any statement by Philip Morris
24         disputing that cigarette smoking was addictive.
25         It just wasn't an issue.  And he's not aware of

 1         any statement at any time by anyone from
 2         Philip Morris denying or disputing that it can
 3         be hard to quit smoking.  They never did that.
 4             The debate on addiction was limited to 12
 5         years after 1988, and the debate was over the
 6         scientific definition of addiction and whether
 7         cigarettes should be lumped together with heroin
 8         and crack cocaine.  And Philip Morris took the
 9         position that it wasn't fair to lump their
10         product and their customers together with people
11         who use those hard illegal drugs.  That was the
12         nature of the debate at that time.
13             Now, that was on nicotine and addiction,
14         what was out in the public.
15             Remember with Dr. Cummings we started with
16         the Vincent Van Gogh painting up there, and
17         again the Florida Health Notes referred to
18         cigarettes as coffin nails back in 1912.
19             And you may recall that Dr. Cummings made
20         statements about this American blend cigarette
21         that was invented in 1913, and he suggested to
22         you that it was the American blend cigarette
23         that really made cigarettes inhalable, really
24         made them addictive, made them harmful.  But he
25         had to admit that even before then, when

 1         cigarettes were made out of Turkish tobacco,
 2         they caused cancer, and people knew that, they
 3         were inhalable and they were addictive.  And
 4         there were references historically to all of
 5         those facts, so much so that even before the
 6         American blend is invented the Florida Health
 7         Notes are calling cigarettes addictive and
 8         coffin nails.
 9             You heard about the Reader's Digest
10         articles, the reference in Time Magazine to
11         coffin nails based on a study showing that
12         smokers were dying earlier than nonsmokers.
13             Life Magazine, down in the lower right
14         corner, that's the mouse skin-painting studies
15         you heard about by Dr. Wynder.
16             And then of course you have the '64 Surgeon
17         General's Report, the coverage of that report
18         right here in Fort Lauderdale.  And the warnings
19         on the pack.  All of that information plus was
20         out in the public domain before and during
21         Ms. Naugle's life.
22             And so the question is, well, it's out
23         there, did people get the message?  And you
24         heard this when Dr. Cummings was here.  By 1954
25         90 percent of the American public had heard or

 1         read that smoking may be a cause of lung cancer.
 2         That's 1954.
 3             1969, you remember Dr. Cummings said, you
 4         know, there's a difference between hearing and
 5         believing and he gave the example of aliens
 6         UFOs.  But by 1969 71 percent of adults
 7         believed, they believed, not just hearing it,
 8         but believed that smoking causes lung cancer.
 9             81 percent believed it in 1978.
10             By 1985 95 percent agreed with the
11         statement.
12             And even on emphysema, when the warning went
13         on the pack, 91 percent of people agreed that
14         smoking causes emphysema.
15             Did people act on that message?  Was it an
16         important enough message to folks that they
17         acted on it?  The answer to that question is yes
18         as well.
19             1965, this is after the Surgeon General's
20         Report, 17 million smokers had quit smoking in
21         1965.  In the four years after that 13 million
22         more people quit smoking.  And by 1985 more than
23         40 million smokers had quit.  And the importance
24         of that, the importance of that is it means the
25         message is getting across to such an extent that

 1         people are acting on the message.
 2             And by 1985 when those warnings, the last
 3         set of warnings went on the pack, more than 40
 4         million Americans had acted on that public
 5         health message and quit smoking.
 6             And you've seen this a couple of times, I
 7         think actually three times during trial.  This
 8         is the year Ms. Naugle started smoking.  And
 9         Dr. Daniel Horn, working for the National
10         Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health said, "You
11         could stand on a rooftop and shout 'smoking is
12         dangerous' at the top of your lungs and you
13         would not be telling anyone anything they did
14         not already know."
15             That's the same year Ms. Naugle started
16         smoking.
17             Another factor to consider on this issue of
18         punitive damages is, well, you heard the public
19         statements by Philip Morris, but what was
20         Philip Morris trying to do, what were they
21         doing.  Were they just standing pat, or were
22         they going out there spending money, devoting
23         resources to try to make cigarettes less
24         hazardous?
25             And you heard about those efforts when

 1         Dr. Cummings was here on cross-examination and
 2         you heard about it when Mr. Jupe was here as
 3         well.  The fact is is that Philip Morris tried
 4         for decades and continues to try to reduce the
 5         health risks of smoking.
 6             I want to stop there for a second, because
 7         you heard testimony about where does the harm
 8         from smoking, where does the addiction come
 9         from.  And the answer you heard in the evidence,
10         well, the nicotine in the cigarettes comes from
11         the tobacco as it's growing in the filed.  As
12         the tobacco ages and gets manufactured, there's
13         actually less nicotine in the cigarette that
14         Philip Morris sells than was in the tobacco
15         growing in the field.  It evaporates, it gets
16         cut out and other things.
17             The nicotine comes from tobacco naturally
18         and that's why Christopher Columbus' sailors had
19         a hard time quitting.  They weren't using
20         manufactured cigarettes.  They were using
21         natural tobacco.
22             What about the harm from smoking, where does
23         that come from?  Well, you've heard that there
24         are thousands of chemicals in a raw tobacco leaf
25         growing in the field and that when that leaf is

 1         burned, in fact, when any organic matter is
 2         burned, the act of burning causes chemical
 3         reactions that produce even more chemicals,
 4         thousands of chemicals.  And among the chemicals
 5         that are produced when you burn tobacco are
 6         dozens of carcinogens.  So the harm comes from
 7         the burning of tobacco.
 8             Now, Philip Morris, you know, uses additives
 9         in their cigarettes.  And a lot of people might
10         come into cases like this, I think you heard
11         discussion in jury selection where people think
12         it's the additives, not the tobacco, but the
13         additives that are causing the disease.
14             Mr. Jupe described how Philip Morris has
15         tested all of the additives they use.  They've
16         disclosed the additives to the federal
17         government.  They've put the additives on their
18         website.  And they've published all the research
19         they've done on additives.  And their research
20         shows that additives do not add to the harm
21         caused by burning tobacco.  It's the burning of
22         tobacco, not the additives.  We showed you a
23         copy of the journal where Philip Morris
24         published its research on that issue.
25             How about these allegations that ammonia is

 1         used to make the cigarettes more addictive?
 2         That's what Dr. Cummings said, but he didn't
 3         actually talk about any studies that showed it.
 4         Mr. Jupe described a study that Philip Morris,
 5         his colleagues there have recently done where
 6         they had people smoke cigarettes with ammonia
 7         and cigarettes without and they had the people
 8         hooked up to something taking their blood from
 9         their arteries every second and what the
10         research showed was ammonia has no impact on the
11         speed of which nicotine is delivered to the
12         body.  And that stands unrebutted.
13             There are also issues relating to
14         reconstituted tobacco you heard about in trial.
15         Dr. Cummings referred to it as adding nicotine
16         to the tobacco.  What you heard is that the
17         process, the tobacco is put in liquid, those
18         stems, and some nicotine remains in the solid
19         part, some nicotine goes in the liquid part and
20         then it's all recombined at the end.  But no
21         nicotine is added, it's just the nicotine that
22         was in there before.
23             And there was a question about, well, can
24         you put in less nicotine?  Can you take nicotine
25         out that way?  Right.  Can you take nicotine

 1         out?
 2             And Mr. Jupe said, yes, when we combine it,
 3         we don't have to put in all the stuff that was
 4         there originally, but it has an impact on the
 5         taste of the cigarettes.  It has an impact on
 6         the taste of the cigarettes.  I mean, an example
 7         would be the difference between the taste of
 8         alcoholic and nonalcoholic beers.  Alcohol has
 9         an impact on taste of beer or wine.  Nicotine
10         has an impact on the taste of a cigarette.  So
11         Mr. Jupe explained how that works.
12             So I started off talking about
13         Philip Morris' efforts to reduce the health
14         risks of smoking over the years, and it's gone
15         on for 60 years.  It started in the 1950s and
16         you saw this that Dr. Wynder in 1957 recommended
17         that the tobacco companies reduce the tar levels
18         of their cigarettes.  And he hypothesized that
19         doing so would reduce the risk of lung cancer.
20             And we showed you this, and Mr. Jupe
21         described for you how Philip Morris responded to
22         that.  Philip Morris responded by implementing
23         all these design changes, the filter, expanded
24         tobacco, reconstituted tobacco, ventilation,
25         porous paper.  He walked through that with you.

 1             And this chart shows the really massive
 2         effect those design features have had on
 3         reducing tar and nicotine.  If you go back to
 4         1955, before cigarettes were filtered or before
 5         filtered cigarettes were popular, the tar was 38
 6         milligrams.  And it's down to about 12 as of the
 7         mid '90s.  And nicotine has been reduced as
 8         well.  So these design features had an effect on
 9         reducing tar and nicotine just like Dr. Wynder
10         recommended in the 1950s.
11             I'm going to -- I brought our timeline that
12         we showed during the direct examination of
13         Mr. Jupe just to give you a sense as to some of
14         the things that were happening during the next
15         40 years with regard to filtered cigarettes
16         after Dr. Wynder made that recommendation.  And
17         you've seen all of these.  But you saw the
18         public health service talking about filtered
19         cigarettes being safer in the 1960s.  You heard
20         in 1968 about the first real study that came out
21         from Dr. Cummings' former employer, scientists
22         there, finding that, just as Dr. Wynder had
23         predicted, if you lower the tar by 40 percent
24         you're going to lower lung cancer by 40 percent.
25         And they found that people who smoked filtered

 1         cigarettes had a 40 percent less risk of lung
 2         cancer.  So the filters were working.
 3             We saw references where the public health is
 4         recommending that people smoke filtered
 5         cigarettes.  That's the cartoon with the guy
 6         walking over the circling sharks.
 7             You know, yesterday Mr. Jupe was
 8         cross-examined with a document that supposedly
 9         showed Philip Morris' internal knowledge, that
10         Philip Morris knew in 1973 that the filters
11         weren't working.  Talked about the moral
12         obligation.  And I got to show you other parts
13         of the document on my redirect.  And what you
14         saw was that Philip Morris scientists were
15         saying, we don't need to tell the FTC that
16         people aren't getting the same amount of smoke
17         the FTC test is measuring because we told the
18         FTC that and they knew it a few years earlier
19         when they were adopting the test.  That's what
20         that was about.  It wasn't about some secret
21         knowledge by Philip Morris that filters and low
22         tar were not working.  And you saw that
23         yesterday.
24             You saw how Philip Morris worked with the
25         National Cancer Institute in 1976 to find ways

 1         to reduce the risk of smoking and that the
 2         National Cancer Institute's group recommended
 3         all of those design features that Philip Morris
 4         used over the years.
 5             You saw the 1981 Surgeon General's Report
 6         where they talked about filters reducing the
 7         risk.  You saw that again in 1996.  But we also
 8         showed you where the public health community
 9         started to change their mind in 2001.
10             2001 the National Cancer Institute said, you
11         know what, filters may not be reducing the
12         risks.  It doesn't appear that filters and
13         low-tar cigarettes are any safer.  And we showed
14         that to you as well.  And then you saw that
15         wasn't the last word on it because the World
16         Health Organization weighed in afterwards.  The
17         Surgeon General did as well.
18             And the last -- one thing we showed was in
19         2012, this is the World Health Organization
20         monograph, their conclusion was that the risk of
21         smoking was higher among men and women who
22         smoked high-tar nonfiltered brands.  That's what
23         they concluded in 2012, that filters were, in
24         fact, reducing the risk.
25             Now, there is a scientific debate on this.

 1         There's no question about it.  There are
 2         credible, respected organizations on both sides
 3         of the issue.  You have the Surgeon General on
 4         one side, the World Health Organization on
 5         another.  And this issue whether filters really,
 6         really, really are safer, may be it won't be
 7         resolved for a number of years as the science
 8         evolves, but the point is that when
 9         Philip Morris was marketing filtered cigarettes
10         and marketing low-tar cigarettes the science was
11         showing that they were, in fact, reducing the
12         health risks.
13             And what did Philip Morris do when the
14         National Cancer Institute suggested maybe
15         filters aren't working?  What did Philip Morris
16         do?  What would you want them to do?  What would
17         you expect them to do?  You would expect them to
18         give that information to their consumers, and
19         that's exactly what Philip Morris did.
20             You saw this when Dr. Cummings was here.
21         Starting in 2002, a year after that NCI
22         monograph, Philip Morris put these onserts on
23         every pack of low-tar and light cigarettes and
24         they told Philip Morris customers that low-tar
25         cigarettes may not be safer, that you should not

 1         assume they're safer.  Philip Morris gave its
 2         consumers, not Philip Morris' message that
 3         filters are safer, which is the company's
 4         belief, they gave the more conservative public
 5         health message that you should not assume
 6         they're safer to make sure that people weren't
 7         keeping smoking under something that could be a
 8         miscomprehension.  Philip Morris provided that
 9         information to all of its low-tar and light
10         smokers in 2002.
11             You know, there was testimony and a question
12         from one of you about e-cigarettes, and so when
13         Mr. Jupe was here we got into that.  And he
14         explained that Philip Morris has a sister
15         company who markets e-cigarettes today and how
16         that's really a new developing market.  But he
17         also talked about what Philip Morris tried to do
18         starting in the '80s, to develop a cigarette, an
19         alternative to a conventional cigarette that
20         would reduce the health risks.  And the
21         cigarette was Accord.  You got to see what it
22         looked like.  It looked like a '90s cell phone
23         that you put a cigarette into and you have to
24         hold it up and smoke.  And, you know, I guess at
25         the time people thought somebody would like

 1         that, but I think it's pretty clear in
 2         retrospect that that's just not something people
 3         are interested in.
 4             Accord did work to reduce the hazardous
 5         chemicals in the smoke, and it took 20 years of
 6         research and development to do it and millions
 7         and millions and millions of dollars.  And
 8         Philip Morris test marketed and it was a flop.
 9         But that's what happens.  Not every research is
10         going to lead to success.
11             Philip Morris also tried making these brands
12         of cigarettes without nicotine.  When
13         Dr. Cummings was here, he fought me on the issue
14         of, well, Philip Morris started this process
15         after they bought General Foods.
16             I think I was standing right over here.  And
17         I said, Dr. Cummings, they bought General Foods,
18         they got the technology to develop Sanka and
19         they took that decaf coffee technology and
20         applied it to cigarettes.
21             And he fought and fought and fought and then
22         we read him what he had actually testified to
23         just earlier under oath in a different case.
24             You heard from Mr. Jupe this story that they
25         did take that process for making decaf coffee

 1         and they saw, can we apply it to tobacco?
 2         Because what they had tried earlier, removing
 3         nicotine by putting ammonia on there or other
 4         heavy chemicals, is that it shredded the tobacco
 5         and you couldn't use the tobacco.  It ruined the
 6         taste.  So this was something new and they spent
 7         400 million dollars on it.  They built a new
 8         factory.  And they put these cigarettes in test
 9         market.
10             Dr. Cummings said, well, these were highly
11         successful products.  That's what he said.  They
12         were a flop.  They tasted awful.  People didn't
13         want to smoke them.
14             And ask yourselves, does it make any sense
15         that Philip Morris would spend 400 million
16         dollars to develop a cigarette without nicotine
17         and it's highly successful, meaning they're
18         selling it and making money off of it, does it
19         make any sense that they would then take it off
20         the market?  Why go through the trouble in the
21         first place?
22             The fact is is that people didn't want to
23         smoke those cigarettes.  Whether it was because
24         they didn't want to smoke a cigarette without
25         nicotine or whether it was because they tasted

 1         lousy, no way to tell.  They certainly reported
 2         that the cigarettes tasted lousy.  And
 3         Philip Morris also -- eventually had to take
 4         them off the market.  But they tried.  They
 5         spent 400 million dollars trying.
 6             This is the criticism, one of the criticisms
 7         for what Philip Morris is doing today.  One of
 8         the criticisms is, hey, you ought to sell
 9         cigarettes that don't have nicotine in them.
10         Philip Morris tried that.  They put in a lot of
11         money, put in a lot of research, they put those
12         cigarettes in test market and nobody wanted to
13         smoke them.  They tried it, it didn't work.
14             Now, on this issue of reducing the risks of
15         smoking, I do want to talk about this flip
16         chart, which is admittedly, and I'm partially to
17         blame for this, it's admittedly become a
18         sideshow in this trial.
19             So there's an article earlier this year in
20         January, doesn't cite any tobacco company
21         documents, you're not talking about things that
22         Philip Morris had knowledge of before January of
23         this year, that shows that the risk of
24         cigarettes -- risk of emphysema, COPD from
25         smoking has increased over time, the relative

 1         risk.  That's what the article says.  And then
 2         the author says, well, we can't explain it, but
 3         here's a plausible explanation.  It may be
 4         because of the change in the design of
 5         cigarettes.  May be, plausible, unexplained.
 6         That's the language in the article.
 7         Dr. Cummings then comes in here and says, not
 8         that it's plausible, not that it's may be, not
 9         that it's unexplained, he says, yeah, it's the
10         change in the design of cigarettes.  They added
11         filters and it's making more people get COPD
12         today than before.
13             That's not what the article showed.  But
14         that's how this became an issue is Dr. Cummings
15         went beyond the article and expressed his view
16         that my client and the other tobacco companies
17         are making cigarettes more dangerous.
18             And so you saw this.  But remember, this
19         is -- CDC says there is no increase from death
20         rates from COPD over the last 10 years, during
21         that 10-year window.  Now, it's been said, well,
22         that 10-year window is after the 10-year window
23         the plaintiffs are talking about.  The point is
24         Dr. Cummings' theory, if Dr. Cummings is right
25         that it's the cigarettes that are making COPD

 1         rates go up, they should keep going up, right?
 2         People are still smoking those cigarettes.
 3         That's the point.  The fact that COPD rates are
 4         not increasing most recently shows that what
 5         Dr. Cummings is saying is just wrong.  And
 6         that's why the authors didn't go that far.  They
 7         said it was unexplained.
 8             We even got to the point of talking about
 9         what Dr. Thun had written before he wrote that
10         article.  Of course in 2004 he said filters
11         reduce the risk of lung cancer, and we showed
12         you that article.  And then when Mr. Jupe was
13         here on redirect you heard what Dr. Thun has
14         been saying even since he wrote that article.
15         Now, if Dr. Cummings is right that the study
16         shows that filters make the cigarettes more
17         dangerous, that's what Dr. Thun would be saying
18         after he wrote the article.  But what Dr. Thun
19         said after he wrote the article in April of this
20         year, so three months after the article, he said
21         he still believes filters reduce the risk of
22         lung cancer.
23             So what you have, I have 2004 on here, you
24         can put the same statement for 2013, and the
25         point is is that it brackets, those two

 1         statements bracket this January 2013 article.
 2         So it's obvious that even the author of the
 3         article does not believe filters have made the
 4         cigarettes more dangerous.
 5             Now, I went into roll-your-own cigarettes
 6         with Dr. Cummings because roll-your-own
 7         cigarettes tend to be cigarettes that don't have
 8         a filter on them, right.  So if you want to know
 9         are the filters making cigarettes more
10         dangerous, like Dr. Cummings said -- he's the
11         only one who said it, not the authors -- compare
12         factory-made cigarettes to roll-your-own
13         cigarettes and see which have higher rates of
14         lung cancer.
15             You know who's done that?  Dr. Cummings.
16         Just last year he did that research.  And you
17         saw his article.  And in his article
18         Dr. Cummings said, if anything the roll-your-own
19         cigarettes are more dangerous than factory-made
20         cigarettes.  And so he's written as recently as
21         last year that the things Philip Morris and the
22         other companies have done have made the
23         cigarettes less dangerous.  Less dangerous
24         compare to roll-your-own cigarettes that don't
25         have those design changes.  That's why that was

 1         important.
 2             And of course we showed you what the World
 3         Health Organization says.  And here's the -- you
 4         know, if you want to know what Dr. Cummings
 5         really believes on this issue not what he said
 6         here, what does he do when he makes cigarettes?
 7         What does he do when he makes cigarettes?  And
 8         he makes them for people to smoke in
 9         experiments.  He puts a filter on them.  He
10         doesn't make people smoke unfiltered cigarettes.
11         And whose filter does he put on there?  He said
12         he puts a Philip Morris filter on there.  That
13         tells you all you need to know about
14         Dr. Cummings' claim, which the authors of the
15         article did not make that my client is making
16         cigarettes more dangerous.  And that's why we
17         spent so time on it because it's an outrageous
18         claim and it's not supported by Dr. Cummings'
19         research and the authors of the article don't
20         believe it either.
21             You know, Dr. Cummings also testified and
22         you heard it this morning, you heard about this
23         smoking cessation newsletter that Merrell Dow
24         put out when they were selling Nicorette.  I
25         think the allegation has been that smoking

 1         cessation newsletter would have told doctors
 2         about nicotine replacement therapy.
 3             Well, I asked Dr. Cummings this, this was on
 4         recross I was allowed to ask a couple more
 5         questions.  I asked him, does that newsletter,
 6         the one Philip Morris supposedly suppressed,
 7         does it even mention nicotine replacement
 8         therapy?  And he said, no, it does not discuss
 9         nicotine replacement therapy.
10             That's their own witness' testimony who is
11         making this claim about Dow Nicorette gum being
12         suppressed and information about it being
13         suppressed.  Well, was the newsletter
14         suppressed?  Did Philip Morris keep that
15         newsletter from reaching doctors?  I asked
16         Dr. Cummings that too, because he wrote in the
17         Surgeon General's Report not what he testified
18         here until I asked him, he wrote that that
19         newsletter was sent out to 450,000 doctors.  How
20         many doctors are there in the United States?
21         450,000?  Whatever it is, that newsletter got
22         out, it got out to hundreds of thousands of
23         doctors.  So the testimony you heard from
24         Dr. Cummings and the claim that there was some
25         suppression of nicotine, this newsletter talking

 1         about Nicorette is just false.  The newsletter
 2         did not talk about Nicorette and it went out to
 3         hundreds of thousands of doctors.
 4             The last thing I want to talk about is this.
 5         And this is -- I'm going to show you some jury
 6         instructions on this.  This is common sense, I
 7         submit to you this is common sense.  The
 8         question whether today in 2013 you need to
 9         impose punitive damages and award additional
10         money in punitive damages for things that
11         happened a long, long time ago.  And this is the
12         last thing I want to talk about.
13             One of the instructions you got is that
14         you're allowed to take into account mitigating
15         evidence when considering punitive damages.
16         Mitigating evidence is evidence that may
17         demonstrate that there is no need for punitive
18         damages today in 2013 or that there's not as
19         much a need as the plaintiff is saying.  That's
20         what mitigation evidence is.
21             And this board right here goes directly to
22         that issue.  Because you've heard in the
23         testimony that -- you heard the evidence that by
24         1970 -- by 1968 Ms. Naugle knew it could be hard
25         to quit smoking and by 1970 she personally

 1         believed smoking was bad for her health.  And so
 2         concealment about the health risks of smoking
 3         and addiction we don't know exactly what the
 4         jury found, but the evidence is that it was a
 5         long time ago with respect to Ms. Naugle and it
 6         was in the 1960s.  And when you think about
 7         whether punitive damages are necessary or
 8         appropriate today in 2013 keep in mind that
 9         we're 40 or 45 years later.  And keep in mind
10         please, please keep in mind everything that has
11         happened since then.  That there's been no
12         television or radio advertising for cigarettes
13         for 42 years.  For 42 years.  There's some of us
14         in the courtroom here who have never seen a
15         cigarette advertisement or radio advertisement.
16         It was a long time ago.
17             There's been warnings on the print ads for
18         41 years.  The same warning on the packs have
19         been on the advertisements.
20             Ingredients have been disclosed to the
21         federal government since 1986.  Philip Morris
22         has put the ingredients on its website for
23         people to see since 2000.
24             In 1998, and I'm going to spend some time on
25         this, there were all those lawsuits by the state

 1         attorneys general.  Everyone, every Attorney
 2         General was going after Philip Morris and the
 3         other tobacco companies.  And that led to a
 4         monumental shift in restrictions on cigarette
 5         advertising and, quite frankly, it led to a
 6         monumental shift in the behavior of the tobacco
 7         companies.  Because when you have every State
 8         Attorney General suing you, it sends a pretty
 9         strong message.
10             And Philip Morris and the other tobacco
11         companies settled those lawsuits.  And you heard
12         about how those settlements restrict the
13         cigarette marketing.  You heard about all the
14         documents that got disclosed and still are on
15         the Philip Morris website.  You heard about how
16         much money Philip Morris has had to pay to the
17         states because of it.  And let me just -- these
18         are the restrictions on Philip Morris' marketing
19         and advertising before the Master Settlement
20         Agreement, then the restrictions in 1998.  And
21         here's something Philip Morris has done above
22         and beyond what they're required to do.  People
23         are concerned about magazine advertising for
24         cigarettes.  They're concerned kids can see
25         those ads.  And starting in 2005 Philip Morris

 1         took its ads out of magazines voluntarily.  Its
 2         competitors continue to advertise in magazines,
 3         but Philip Morris does not do it.
 4             At some point, at some point enough is
 5         enough, isn't it?  Because Philip Morris settled
 6         those lawsuits and they have paid an enormous
 7         amount of money.  Since 1997 they've paid over
 8         62 billion dollars to the states.  Florida alone
 9         has received 4 billion dollars.  This has been
10         going on from 1997 forward.  And it's going to
11         continue forever, Philip Morris has to continue
12         paying this money and having those restrictions
13         on its advertising and marketing for as long as
14         Philip Morris exists.
15             And so in terms of mitigation I'd ask you to
16         consider the restrictions on Philip Morris today
17         and also just the incredible amount of money
18         Philip Morris has been required to pay to the
19         states in these cases.  And you know from other
20         testimony, other lawsuits out there, you know
21         Dr. Cummings has testified more than a hundred
22         cases.  So at some point enough is enough.
23             In this case you're going to, you will
24         fairly and fully compensate Ms. Naugle for her
25         injuries.  And on this claim for additional

 1         money on punitive damages I'd submit to you the
 2         answer should be zero.  It should be zero for
 3         all the reasons talked about, all these
 4         restrictions on the company's business today.
 5             But just as important as the Master
 6         Settlement Agreement is what Philip Morris has
 7         done to change itself.
 8             Starting in the fall of 2000 there was no
 9         more fighting, there was no more debating, no
10         more disputing that smoking caused lung cancer.
11         Philip Morris aligned itself with the public
12         health community 13 years ago and put on its
13         website an agreement that smoking causes lung
14         cancer and other serious diseases.
15             Philip Morris also stopped fighting about
16         addiction.  There was the 12-year fight on
17         addiction and Philip Morris stopped that as
18         well.  That we agree.
19             And now you heard Philip Morris speaks, even
20         where Philip Morris disagrees on issues like
21         filtered cigarettes with the Surgeon General,
22         Philip Morris defers and says to the public,
23         listen to the public health community.  We're
24         not going to say anything publicly that disputes
25         the public health community message.  If that's

 1         not a change, that's not a change from what you
 2         saw in the '50s, '60s, '70s, that's as big a
 3         change as you possibly could make in terms of
 4         the information that you're providing.  It's a
 5         shift 180 degrees.  It happened in 2000 and
 6         we're 13 years later now.
 7             Philip Morris also supported regulation of
 8         the cigarette industry by the Food and Drug
 9         Administration.  For a decade before the law was
10         passed Philip Morris supported it.  And you
11         heard the law grants regulatory control over
12         cigarettes, regulates advertising, marketing and
13         labeling.  The FDA gets to look at the tobacco
14         company documents.  They do surprise inspections
15         of Philip Morris.  And Mr. Jupe told you about
16         that, how the FDA came unannounced and did its
17         inspection and how he worked with the FDA
18         answering questions and guiding their inspection
19         of the facilities.  They looked at the
20         factories.  They looked at the filters.  They
21         looked at the additives.  And they did not find
22         any noncompliance with the regulation.
23             Even during the government shutdown the FDA
24         continues to operate because it's paid for not
25         by taxpayers, but it's paid for by the tobacco

 1         companies.  And you heard -- this ads up to, I
 2         think, roughly 1.7 billion dollars or so and
 3         about half of that has been paid by
 4         Philip Morris.
 5             So in addition to the billions and billions
 6         of dollars Philip Morris has spent settling
 7         lawsuits with the states and paying to the
 8         states, they also are funding the cost of their
 9         regulation because that's what Congress
10         required.
11             And this is not empty regulation at all.
12         The FDA has enormous powers.  If Philip Morris
13         is to violate the law and violate the
14         regulations, they can shut down their plants;
15         they can seize their products in their
16         warehouses; they can go into the store and tell
17         retailers, you cannot sell this cigarette
18         because Philip Morris violated the law; they can
19         impose massive fines and penalties.  And none of
20         that has happened to Philip Morris because
21         Philip Morris has complied with the regulations
22         and restrictions, just like they have complied
23         since 1997 with those settlement agreements and
24         all the restrictions on their advertising.
25         There's been no violations by Philip Morris.

 1             And on this issue of mitigation you're
 2         allowed to "consider the extent to which
 3         Philip Morris' conduct has changed from the
 4         conduct that harmed Ms. Naugle and the extent to
 5         which circumstances have changed."
 6             And I'd submit to you that everything the
 7         plaintiff is saying Philip Morris continues to
 8         do today there's nothing illegal or wrongful
 9         about it.  Philip Morris continues to sell
10         cigarettes and it's legal for them to do that.
11         Philip Morris continues to have nicotine in the
12         tobacco in the cigarettes and that's also legal
13         for Philip Morris to do.
14             Philip Morris markets cigarettes, although
15         you've heard about the restrictions, and that
16         Philip Morris doesn't advertise in magazines
17         that is legal for Philip Morris to do.  Even
18         Dr. Cummings admitted -- they talk about a
19         conspiracy nonstop, even Dr. Cummings admitted
20         the conspiracy stopped in 1998.  Fifteen years
21         ago.  What is there that remains to be deterred
22         and punished that would warrant awarding more
23         money in punitive damages?
24             Given everything you've heard in this case,
25         I submit the answer is no, nothing.  And as I've

 1         indicated, you should fully and fairly
 2         compensate Ms. Naugle for her medical bills not
 3         the amount of pain and suffering they're asking
 4         for because it's outrageous, but on punitive
 5         damages there's just no need right now in 2013
 6         for additional money in the form of punitive
 7         damages.
 8             One more instruction and one more point I
 9         want to make.  You're entitled to conclude that
10         misconduct that occurred in the distant past and
11         involved actors who are no longer associated
12         with Philip Morris need not be punished or that
13         should be punished less severely than recent
14         misconduct.
15             You know, I don't get to go last.
16         Mr. Uustal gets a chance to go after me.  And I
17         don't know what he's going to say, but maybe
18         he's going to show you things that you've seen
19         in the trial that might have a tendency to make
20         people angry.  And you might think, well --
21         maybe he'll get you worked up and you'll say, I
22         want to get in my car and drive up to Richmond,
23         Virginia and I want to get my hands on some of
24         those people I've seen in the documents.  You
25         drive up to Richmond, Virginia today and you

 1         knock on the door and say, I want to see Joe
 2         Cullman, I want to see George Weissman, I want
 3         to talk to Helmut Wakeham, they're going to say,
 4         Who?  Those people have been long gone from the
 5         company.  And what you're going to get is you're
 6         going to get Richard Jupe and you're going to
 7         get a new generation of management.
 8             The people who did the things that they've
 9         shown you are long gone from the company.  Any
10         punitive damages you impose today would be
11         punishing the wrong people.  And it's easy to
12         think of Philip Morris as a person, it's a
13         company.  It's easy to think of Philip Morris as
14         a person because it's a name, it sounds like a
15         person, but the fact is that there have been
16         generations and generations and generations of
17         management through that company during the 60 or
18         70 years we're talking about.  And the people
19         who are there today are not the people who are
20         in the documents you've seen or the videos
21         you've seen.
22             And you can tell that it's a different
23         company from the different message it puts on
24         its website.  You can tell that it's a different
25         company because they're putting that onsert on

 1         cigarettes giving people the public health
 2         message about low-tar cigarettes.  You can tell
 3         it's a different company because they supported
 4         FDA regulation.  You can tell they're a
 5         different company because they publish all their
 6         research, the public has access to their
 7         documents.  Don't be misled, please, by the fact
 8         that it's named Philip Morris and the company
 9         has had the same name for the last 70 years.
10         It's not the same people.  It's not the same
11         people at all.  And that's something you're
12         entitled to consider.  And I ask you to consider
13         on this issue of punitive damages.
14             This is the Philip Morris today in 2013.
15         People whose names you've heard are gone.
16         Philip Morris today supports a single consistent
17         message, the public health community's message.
18         Philip Morris supported FDA regulation and
19         operates in a highly restricted and regulated
20         environment today in 2013.  And it's a different
21         company run by a different group of people.
22             For all of these reasons that I've spent a
23         lot of time on, because that's what this case
24         seems to be about, it's a question of punitive
25         damages.  As I did in my opening statement, I

 1         ask you to award zero on this question.  Because
 2         you are going to fully and fairly compensate
 3         Ms. Naugle and there just is no need to award
 4         additional money in the form of punitive
 5         damages.
 6             I mentioned a minute ago that Mr. Uustal
 7         gets to go last.  And this is my -- this is my
 8         last minute or two with you.  And I don't know
 9         what he's going to say.  I don't get a chance to
10         respond.  And so I think you've seen through the
11         trial that there were two sides to every story.
12         This is the one time I don't get to present the
13         other side of the story.  So I'd ask you to keep
14         that in mind when you're listening to the
15         rebuttal closing.
16             And we've asked a lot of you so far in this
17         case -- we've been here together if you go back
18         to when people volunteered for the jury, we've
19         been here together almost two weeks.  We've
20         asked you to step out of the courtroom, come
21         back in, step back out.  The first day of trial
22         we said, go home, we're not ready.  You've had
23         to sit there listening to a lot of evidence.
24         And I would ask one more thing of you when you
25         go back in that jury room.  I would ask you to

 1         award Ms. Naugle the medical bills compensation
 2         she's requesting in the amounts that both sides
 3         agree to.  I would ask you to be full -- fair on
 4         pain and suffering compensation and not award
 5         the excessive and unreasonable amount of money
 6         they're requesting, but to think about in terms
 7         of what would compensate Ms. Naugle, because the
 8         amount they're asking for goes well beyond
 9         compensating Ms. Naugle.
10             And lastly on the issue of punitive damages,
11         the last thing I'd ask you to do is when you get
12         to that question to fill in a zero on that line
13         on the verdict form because there's just no need
14         to award additional money in this case.
15             And, again, I thank you very much on my
16         behalf and Ms. Arnold's behalf as well for your
17         time and attention.  You've been great.  I've
18         been up here for a while.  And the case is going
19         to be in your hands soon and the job will shift
20         from me and Mr. Uustal to you.  And I thank you
21         very much for it.
