MR. FURR:
Last time for me up here, ladies
03:37:17
and gentlemen.
03:37:20
The only request that I'm going to make of
03:37:21
you is that you consider the new evidence that
03:37:25
you've heard today as your instructions say you
03:37:29
should and that you render a verdict in this
03:37:34
case based on the new evidence and the new legal
03:37:37
instructions that you have received today.
I suspect that one month ago none of you
ever envisioned spending a day of your life
03:37:41
03:37:46
03:37:51
thinking about the concept of punitive damages.
03:37:55
It's not a concept that most people think about
03:38:01
a lot.
It's not a concept that most people know
03:38:03
a lot about.
I'm sure you've learned a lot
03:38:07
today from the Court when the instructions were
03:38:11
provided to you about how different punitive
03:38:15
damages really are than other types of damages.
03:38:17
And because we have a specialized set of legal
03:38:22
rules that apply to this award of punitive
03:38:24
damages that are different than what you used to
03:38:29
base -- to reach your decision in the first
phase of this trial, I'm going to begin by
03:38:35
03:38:37 4597
talking with you a little bit about the new
03:38:40
instructions that you've gotten and then we'll
03:38:42
talk about the evidence that's relevant under
03:38:45
the new instructions that you received.
The first thing I'd like to point out is
03:38:48
03:38:52
that in your punitive damages instruction number
03:38:55
1 and at the bottom of your verdict form you
were instructed by the Court that you may in
your discretion decline to assess punitive
damages.
Of course the reason you have that
03:38:58
03:39:00
03:39:04
03:39:07
instruction is that notwithstanding your verdict
03:39:13
last Friday, the law recognizes that you're
03:39:16
going to hear new evidence today and that you're
03:39:18
going to be instructed on new legal principles
03:39:20
and that you as a juror have a right to
03:39:22
determine that based on the new evidence and new
03:39:25
law that you've been handed that you can
conclude that, in fact, today it's not the
03:39:27
03:39:32
proper thing to do.
So that's an option that's
03:39:34
open to you.
03:39:37
Second thing I want to remind you of is that
03:39:37
punitive damages can only be awarded to the
estate of Juanita Thurston.
03:39:41
03:39:43
Let's think about that from the other side
03:39:47
of the coin.
Stated differently, they can't be
03:39:50 4598
awarded to public health agencies or
03:39:53
smoking-cessation clinics or charities or other
03:39:55
smokers or anyone other than Ms. Odom.
And
you'll see on your verdict form the only
question you receive has to do with awarding
punitive damages to the estate of Juanita
Thurston.
03:39:59
03:40:02
03:40:03
03:40:06
03:40:09
THE COURT:
Can I see the lawyers up here?
03:40:09
I apologize for the interruption, but I need to
03:40:11
talk to the lawyers.
MR. FURR:
Yes, sir.
(The following discussion was held at
sidebar:)
03:40:13
03:40:13
03:40:07
THE COURT:
I think you're talking about the
03:40:07
verdict form.
Look at the caption on the
verdict form.
03:40:10
03:40:12
MR. GARCIA:
Yeah, that's not it.
That's an
03:40:13
old version.
I'll give you the correct version.
03:40:15
MS. BAKER-BARNES:
But they have it though.
03:40:21
THE COURT:
I believe they probably have --
03:40:21
MR. GARCIA:
Hang on, let me show you the
one that I've got.
THE COURT:
Okay.
03:40:26
03:40:28
03:40:28
MR. GARCIA:
This is what I was provided and
03:40:34
what I understood was given to the jurors.
03:40:36 4599
THE COURT:
This would be the correct that I
03:40:41
had previously ruled --
03:40:45
MR. GARCIA:
That's the one we discussed and
03:40:46
that's the one --
MR. FURR:
Is that the one that was
distributed?
MR. GARCIA:
I don't know what was
03:40:47
03:40:48
03:40:50
03:40:51
distributed, but that's the one we agreed on.
03:40:52
THE COURT:
I have a felling that the one
03:40:54
that was distributed was the one that has the
03:40:55
name --
03:40:57
MR. GARCIA:
Then, let's make sure that the
03:40:58
correct one goes back with them.
THE COURT:
I don't have a problem with
03:41:00
03:41:01
that, but I'm glad you've got this because I --
03:41:03
MR. GARCIA:
Let's make sure that Shelly
03:41:07
collects everything before they go in and then
03:41:09
we bring back to them the correct one.
MR. FURR:
Agreed.
03:41:14
03:41:15
(Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the
03:41:25
following proceedings were held in open court:)
MR. FURR:
May I proceed, Your Honor?
THE COURT:
Yes, you may.
03:41:37
03:41:37
03:41:40
MR. FURR:
I'm happy to tell you that that
03:41:41
conference had nothing to do with the argument
03:41:43 I'm making.
Anyway, important for you to understand

03:41:48
03:41:50
where the award would go in this case, you need
03:41:51
to understand you've been asked to award 18
million dollars to the estate of Juanita
03:41:53
03:41:56
Thurston and you can't award it to anyone else.
03:41:59
I think you already know this, but your
03:42:01
instruction number one tells you that this will
03:42:03
be in addition to the compensatory damages you
03:42:05
have already awarded.
You remember, of course,
03:42:09
you awarded 6 million dollars last Friday.
When
03:42:13
the comparative fault rule is applied to that,
03:42:15
that's an award of four and a half million
dollars.
Important instruction, number 2, in your
03:42:21
03:42:25
03:42:25
package.
You have all these.
They're brief.
I
03:42:27
think they'll be easy for you to access.
But
03:42:29
punitive damages must be based solely on conduct
03:42:32
you found to have caused Ms. Thurston's death.
03:42:34
Let's remind ourselves what that conduct is and
03:42:38
what that conduct isn't.
The conduct that you
03:42:42
found to have caused her death on which punitive
03:42:45
damages can be based is that Reynolds concealed
03:42:48
information and agreed to conceal information
03:42:51
between May 5th, 1982 and 1987.
In other words,
03:42:53 4601
not for harm to other smokers, not for strict
03:42:58
liability, not for negligence.
03:43:03
Another important instruction, number 2, you
03:43:05
will see, you may not seek to punish Reynolds
03:43:10
for any harms suffered by any persons other than
03:43:14
Juanita Thurston.
03:43:17
As the Court explained to you, when reaching
03:43:18
your last verdict, you were permitted to
consider the number of other people that had
03:43:21
03:43:24
injured by tobacco for the purposes of assessing
03:43:26
reprehensibility, but now the Court has
instructed you that you may not consider the
injuries to other people when you reach a
03:43:31
03:43:35
03:43:37
decision about punitive damages in this case.
03:43:40
You will also -- so when you put all that
together, I won't belabor this, but the
03:43:45
03:43:48
punishment can be based only on concealment of
03:43:52
information, an agreement to conceal information
03:43:54
within our time frame of 1982 to 1987 that was a
03:43:57
legal cause of Ms. Thurston's death.
Now, counsel tells you that your decision
should be based only on what occurred
03:44:02
03:44:04
03:44:08
historically, but if you read instruction number
03:44:10
4, you shall see that, in fact, the law
recognizes that there can be mitigating
03:44:15
03:44:19 4602
evidence.
And that mitigating evidence is
03:44:26
evidence which may demonstrate that there is no
03:44:28
need for punitive damages or that a reduced
03:44:30
amount of punitive damages should be imposed.
03:44:32
Your instruction number 4 actually lists for
03:44:36
you categories of evidence that can be
mitigating and also tells you that those
03:44:39
03:44:43
categories are not exclusive but just examples
03:44:46
of evidence that you may find to be mitigating.
03:44:49
Because the question before you is whether to
03:44:57
punish RJ Reynolds more in the year 2014 for
03:45:00
conduct that you know must have ended 25 years
03:45:07
ago in 1987 when Ms. Thurston stopped smoking,
03:45:12
because no subsequent conduct could have been
03:45:18
the cause of her disease and death.
That's sort of the legal framework that
03:45:21
03:45:23
we're in.
So now I want to talk to you about
03:45:29
the evidence that relates to those legal
principles.
And I want to go back to jury selection.
Because something very important occurred in
03:45:33
03:45:37
03:45:39
03:45:41
jury selection.
Mr. Garcia spent a couple hours
03:45:43
with you talking about two different topics.
03:45:47
The first one was this:
He talked with you at
03:45:51
length about how when people change they deserve
03:45:54 4603
a fresh start.
And each and every one of you
03:45:59
agreed that when people change they deserve a
03:46:05
fresh start.
Well, you have instruction number 3 that
tells you that you should not discriminate
03:46:08
03:46:11
03:46:15
between corporations and natural individuals and
03:46:18
that both are persons in the eyes of the law.
03:46:21
Given that, isn't it also true, ladies and
03:46:26
gentlemen, that when a corporation changes it
03:46:30
also deserves a fresh start just like we give
03:46:33
people?
What's changed since the days in which
Juanita Thurston was smoking?
Everything.
Everything has changed.
03:46:38
03:46:42
03:46:46
03:46:48
You saw a lot of evidence in the first phase
03:46:49
that you may not have liked, I'm not here to
question that, but it's over, it's in the
03:46:51
03:46:54
distant past and it's gone.
I'm not going to
03:46:56
belabor this because you've just heard all this
03:46:59
today.
The Tobacco Institute is gone.
The
03:47:03
Council for Tobacco Research is gone.
The TIRC
03:47:06
is gone.
There are no successor organizations
03:47:08
that continue the actions that they were taking.
03:47:11
There is no debate by Reynolds with the
03:47:13
public health community or anybody else about
03:47:15 4604
whether smoking is dangerous or addictive.
03:47:18
There's no dispute.
There's no debate.
There's
03:47:21
no campaign of doubt.
Reynolds has backed out
03:47:24
of that discussion and told smokers, look to the
03:47:27
public health community, look to the public
03:47:33
health community and follow the recommendations
03:47:35
of the public health community when you make
03:47:37
decisions about tobacco use.
What more could
03:47:42
they do?
What more could they do than withdraw
03:47:44
their voice from the debate and tell people,
rely on your public health authorities?
03:47:49
03:47:51
The actors that you heard about in the first
03:47:55
phase, they're gone too.
I won't belabor this.
03:47:58
You know that the executives, the executives,
03:48:02
like Mr. Johnston, Mr. Horrigan, Mr. Heimann
03:48:04
they're all gone for decades.
You know that the
03:48:10
scientists who wrote those memoranda are Claude
03:48:14
Teague, Alan Rodgman, Murray Senkus, they're all
03:48:16
gone.
But their memoranda and the actions they
03:48:22
took may have made you mad.
And I'm not here to
03:48:24
tell you that it shouldn't have made you mad.
And I'm not here to defend the actions that they
03:48:25
took.
But if you want to punish these
03:48:26
individuals for the actions that they took you
03:48:32
won't succeed in doing so by punishing RJ
03:48:34 4605
Reynolds.
As you know, four of those gentlemen
03:48:38
have actually passed away already.
The other
03:48:40
two are long gone from the company.
Is Reynolds different?
I told you
03:48:43
03:48:45
everything is different, and you know everything
03:48:47
is different today.
03:48:48
The FDA has regulated the marketing and sale
03:48:49
of tobacco products since 2009.
You heard
03:48:53
Dr. Figlar, I mean, the fact of the matter is RJ
03:48:58
Reynolds and the other tobacco companies are in
03:49:01
lockdown.
The FDA determines how cigarettes can
03:49:03
be made, how cigarettes can be marketed, how
cigarettes can be sold.
And Reynolds has to
03:49:07
03:49:10
disclose everything it does to the FDA who has
03:49:13
enforcement powers that you were told about.
03:49:16
RJR operates under the microscope of constant
03:49:21
transparency of everything it does with the FDA.
03:49:26
So you have to ask yourself:
Is punishment
03:49:32
the right thing to do today?
As you heard, the company is led by new
03:49:34
03:49:37
executives.
There's new ownership.
There's new
03:49:39
scientists.
Since the merger, everything has
03:49:42
changed.
And you really have to ask yourself,
03:49:44
it's obvious that the company has taken a fresh
03:49:47
start, that everything has changed since 2000,
03:49:52 4606
that there's no more debating or disputing the
03:49:55
dangers, but the company is working hard to make
03:49:58
safer tobacco products and to tell the public
03:50:00
about them.
There's really not much more they
03:50:03
could do.
They've turned the corner.
They're
03:50:06
acting as a responsible company.
And you have
03:50:09
to ask yourself if after 15 years of that
conduct you still think that they should be
punished.
The question for you, you'll see on
instruction 3 the deterrence issue actually
applies not just to others, but also to
03:50:13
03:50:16
03:50:20
03:50:22
03:50:23
03:50:27
RJ Reynolds.
And so the question becomes for
03:50:30
you, are punitive damages needed to prevent
03:50:32
Reynolds from concealing and agreeing to conceal
03:50:36
information in 2014?
You know the answer to
that.
It's not real -- there's really no
03:50:39
03:50:41
dispute that Reynolds doesn't conceal or agree
03:50:44
to conceal information from anybody about
03:50:46
anything.
Even Dr. Cummings told you that the
03:50:49
conspiracy ended in 1998, 15 years ago.
That
03:50:55
was the evidence from Phase I.
And you know
that RJ Reynolds conducts itself in a fully
03:51:00
03:51:04
transparent fashion today and informs smokers.
03:51:07
It doesn't just tell them rely on public health.
03:51:11 4607
RJ Reynolds' core values and beliefs are stated
03:51:14
on its website unequivocally.
03:51:18
Voluntarily RJ Reynolds has a website that
03:51:21
warns smokers it produces reduced-risk products
03:51:24
and cessation aids and voluntarily RJ Reynolds
03:51:27
has youth smoking prevention programs.
You know
03:51:32
that all these things are voluntary.
They're
03:51:34
not required.
They're not done by a court
03:51:37
order.
They're not done with a gun to the head.
03:51:39
RJ Reynolds does these things because they
believe it's the right thing to do.
You met Dr. Figlar today.
You heard how
Dr. Figlar answered my questions and the
03:51:42
03:51:44
03:51:45
03:51:49
questions from plaintiff's counsel.
You saw the
03:51:52
frank, candid, non -- un -- excuse me,
03:51:58
nonargumentative responsive way that he answered
03:52:00
every question that was put to him, and you get
03:52:03
to decide whether people like Dr. Figlar working
03:52:07
in these companies today deserve to be punished
03:52:11
for conduct that ended 25 years ago.
Because
03:52:14
that's what you're being asked to do.
You know what RJ Reynolds tells smokers
03:52:18
03:52:22
today, unequivocal:
"Cigarette smoking is the
03:52:24
leading cause of preventible death in the United
03:52:28
States.
Cigarette smoking significantly
03:52:31 4608
increases the risk of developing lung cancer,
03:52:32
heart disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and
03:52:35
other serious diseases and adverse conditions --
03:52:38
health conditions."
"Quitting smoking -- quitting cigarette
smoking significantly reduces the risk for
serious diseases."
"RJ Reynolds believes that individuals
should rely on the conclusions of the U.S.
03:52:40
03:52:42
03:52:43
03:52:45
03:52:48
03:52:50
Surgeon General, the Centers for Disease Control
03:52:53
and other public health officials when making
03:52:55
decisions regarding smoking."
RJ Reynolds discloses the additives and
ingredients that it uses in every brand of
cigarette and any interested smoker can look
their brand up and see what additives are in
their brand.
03:52:57
03:53:01
03:53:05
03:53:07
03:53:10
03:53:13
Complete transparency.
All the information
03:53:15
that was claimed was not provided in the first
03:53:18
phase of this trial it is now provided to
smokers so that they can make the informed
03:53:21
03:53:23
decisions that RJ Reynolds wants them to make
03:53:26
with respect to smoking and the use of other
tobacco products.
But RJ Reynolds doesn't stop there.
They
03:53:29
03:53:32
03:53:34 4609
don't just tell the public to consider other
types of tobacco products.
They try to make
other types of tobacco products and tell the
public what the relative dangers of those
products are versus smoking.
Let's go back to the first phase, because
03:53:38
03:53:42
03:53:45
03:53:48
03:53:51
03:53:53
you've been told and counsel has asked you to
03:53:55
rely upon the evidence from Phase I, and you're
03:53:58
entitled to do that.
So let's remind ourself
03:54:01
what some very important evidence was that you
03:54:04
heard in the first phase.
Dr. Burns told you the following, he was
03:54:06
03:54:08
asked, "Dr. Burns, you agree that there is no
03:54:10
such thing as a safe cigarette, right?
03:54:14
"Answer:
There is currently no such thing
03:54:16
as a safe cigarette if by the definition of
03:54:18
cigarette you mean tobacco rolled up in paper
03:54:21
and burned."
Sounds like a good definition for a
cigarette.
03:54:23
03:54:25
03:54:27
Dr. Cummings.
"Would you agree, sir, that
03:54:28
it is simply not possible to remove all of the
03:54:31
carcinogens found in tobacco smoke when it is
03:54:36
burned?
"Answer:
True."
03:54:38
03:54:39 4610
No ambiguity in the evidence.
If you burn
03:54:41
tobacco you generate a smoke that contains
03:54:46
carcinogens.
You can't take them all out.
You
03:54:49
can't make it safe.
It can't be done even in
03:54:53
the year 2014, and nobody is claiming that they
03:54:56
can.
03:55:00
Did Reynolds throw up its hands and quit and
03:55:01
say it can't be done, we'll just warn smokers,
03:55:04
let them make their choices and take the risk
03:55:07
that accompany those choices?
No.
Reynolds has
03:55:12
spent decades and billions of dollars trying to
03:55:13
find other ways for people who want to use
tobacco to do so with lower risk than
tobacco-burning cigarettes.
Reynolds tells smokers that no tobacco
03:55:17
03:55:21
03:55:23
03:55:25
product has been shown to be safe and without
03:55:29
risk but it informs smokers about the
03:55:31
availability of reduced-risk products, including
03:55:34
cessation aids.
03:55:37
Do you remember the migration strategy that
03:55:38
Dr. Figlar told you is at the core of how
Reynolds conducts business today?
Reynolds
tells smokers "The best course of action for
03:55:43
03:55:46
03:55:49
tobacco consumers concerned about their health
03:55:51
is to quit.
Adults who continue to use tobacco
03:55:54 4611
should consider the reduction of risks for
serious diseases associated with moving from
03:55:58
03:56:01
cigarettes to the use of smoke-free tobacco or
03:56:03
nicotine products."
The migration strategy.
It's really important that the first
sentence is, if you're concerned you should
quit.
No ambiguity.
No equivocation, quit.
That's the best thing for you to do.
But if
you're not going to quit now, you should
03:56:06
03:56:09
03:56:11
03:56:13
03:56:17
03:56:21
03:56:24
consider moving to a less risky tobacco product.
03:56:26
And RJ Reynolds tells consumers how to
evaluate tobacco products.
You saw this
03:56:31
03:56:35
demonstrative that Dr. Figlar used that explains
03:56:38
to smokers that cigarettes that burn tobacco are
03:56:42
the most risky and as you go down the line and
03:56:45
switch to different products.
You can go to
03:56:48
smokeless tobacco products of different types or
03:56:50
nicotine products that carry less risk.
In
03:56:52
fact, Dr. DiFranza -- it may have seemed odd to
03:56:55
you the way we started our case this morning.
03:56:59
We played for you a deposition excerpt from
03:57:03
Dr. DiFranza, whom, I'm sure once you saw the
03:57:05
video especially, you remember as having been
03:57:08
the rebuttal witness that the plaintiffs called
03:57:11 4612
in the first phase of this trial.
Dr. DiFranza
03:57:14
told you that the consumption of pure nicotine
03:57:18
is safe and that if people move to the
consumption of pure nicotine, including
e-cigarettes, that hundreds of thousands of
03:57:20
03:57:25
03:57:27
lives will be saved in the United States alone.
03:57:29
So what has Reynolds done?
Reynolds has
03:57:34
tried to develop those products that would allow
03:57:37
smokers to move down that continuum of risk and
03:57:40
face considerably less danger from their use of
03:57:44
tobacco than they otherwise would.
You saw this a lot.
I won't belabor it.
03:57:46
03:57:49
But RJ Reynolds has developed products that fit
03:57:53
into every category of product on that risk
continuum, the heat-not-burn products, the
03:57:56
03:57:59
e-cigarette products, the smokeless products.
03:58:01
Now, Reynolds doesn't tell anybody that they're
03:58:03
safe or harmless.
They can't do it.
They don't
03:58:05
have the data to do it.
The FDA won't let you
03:58:07
do it.
But nonetheless, everyone agrees that
03:58:09
these products are less risky.
But RJ Reynolds
03:58:12
takes it a step further.
As you know, they have
03:58:16
developed these ZONNIC products that we looked
03:58:19
at, which are nicotine replacement products that
03:58:22
are used to help smokers quit.
03:58:27 4613
So you heard a lot of evidence in the first
03:58:31
phase about has RJ Reynolds done anything to
help smokers quit.
Well, now you know the
03:58:34
03:58:38
answer is yes.
They went out and purchased this
03:58:40
company and they got FDA approval to market
these in the United States.
03:58:42
03:58:45
Okay.
Premier and Eclipse.
You heard a lot
03:58:50
about them, decades of research, hundreds of
scientific studies, billion dollars spent.
Eclipse tastes -- excuse me, Premier tasted
03:58:54
03:58:57
03:59:01
awful and smelled pretty bad.
You can imagine
03:59:04
what some people have said that it smells like.
03:59:07
Nobody buys it.
Nobody likes it.
Nobody smokes
03:59:11
it.
Took it off the market, went back to the
03:59:15
laboratory, reengineered the product, came out
03:59:18
with Eclipse, which is sold nationally,
03:59:26
including here in Florida, a less risky product,
03:59:27
just like Dr. Cummings told you Premier was, but
03:59:29
the costs of producing it are so high and so few
03:59:32
people buy it that RJ Reynolds loses money on
03:59:36
every pack that it sells.
But nonetheless they
03:59:38
keep it on the market so that smokers have that
03:59:42
product to go to if that's the choice they make.
03:59:46
SNUS, the product that Dr. Figlar worked on
03:59:53
a great deal, you heard that they spent
03:59:55 4614
somewhere in the range of 50 million dollars to
03:59:58
develop this product and market it and that it
04:00:01
is a smokeless product that dramatically lowers
04:00:04
the diseases, especially those diseases
associated with inhalation of tobacco smoke.
04:00:08
04:00:12
Dr. Figlar explained to you that the drive
04:00:15
behind developing SNUS was that in Sweden,
unlike here, a large percentage of the
04:00:20
04:00:25
population has moved from combustible inhalable
04:00:28
tobacco products to using SNUS, and that as that
04:00:32
migration from cigarettes to SNUS occurred that
04:00:37
the lung cancer rates dropped in Sweden.
04:00:40
Because of course you don't inhale SNUS.
Smoke
04:00:43
doesn't get into the lungs.
There is no smoke.
04:00:47
Now, no one claims it's a safe product.
04:00:50
Reynolds tells everybody, it's addictive and it
04:00:53
can cause mouth cancer, but it's a lot safer
04:00:55
than tobacco-burning cigarettes and it's been
04:00:59
brought to the market to give smokers, tobacco
04:01:01
users, another option to use tobacco without
facing the risk of smoking cigarettes.
04:01:04
04:01:07
VUSE, the electronic cigarette.
You heard
04:01:12
that RJ Reynolds has spent about 175 million
04:01:16
dollars over three years to develop their VUSE
04:01:20
cigarette.
They didn't just go out and buy some
04:01:23 4615
other cigarette on the market and try to sell
04:01:27
it.
Instead you heard they developed the new
04:01:29
technology that could be used that much more
04:01:32
tightly controlled the vapor delivered from VUSE
04:01:37
so that each puff would be consistent, just like
04:01:40
Dr. DiFranza told you that they should.
There's
04:01:45
no tobacco burned.
There's no tobacco smoke.
04:01:48
It's basically a nicotine vapor.
04:01:50
Now, Dr. DiFranza, I want to go back to that
04:01:55
because there's a reason we played that
04:01:59
testimony for you because we wanted you to hear
04:02:01
from one of plaintiff's witnesses the benefits
04:02:03
of e-cigarette, not from our witness.
Dr. DiFranza told you that e-cigarettes he
04:02:06
04:02:09
believes can be a very safe product if they're
04:02:11
regulated and made by the right companies.
He
04:02:14
told you they could help smokers quit.
They can
04:02:17
decrease nicotine addiction and e-cigarettes are
04:02:21
much safer than conventional cigarettes.
04:02:24
In fact, here's what he said in that video.
04:02:27
And by the way, the video was entered into
04:02:30
evidence.
You'll have it back there.
You can
04:02:32
play Dr. DiFranza's statements from that
Massachusetts -- University of Massachusetts
program that he was involved in.
04:02:35
04:02:38
04:02:40 4616
Here's what he said:
And if we could get
04:02:42
people off the cigarettes, off of the tobacco
04:02:45
and just get them to take the medicinal form of
04:02:48
pure form of nicotine that would save hundreds
04:02:53
of thousands of lives every year.
You know, by the way, you heard that even
04:02:57
04:03:00
though e-cigarettes aren't regulated yet, the
04:03:03
FDA is getting ready to do so, Reynolds
voluntarily put a warning label on VUSE that
04:03:06
04:03:10
tells the consuming public that VUSE contains
04:03:14
nicotine, which is addictive.
Dr. DiFranza was asked a very interesting
04:03:16
04:03:19
question in that area, about whether he thought
04:03:22
it would be a good thing if companies like RJ
04:03:24
Reynolds began making these cigarettes as
opposed to the companies that are currently
making the cigarettes, which of course is
04:03:28
04:03:32
04:03:34
exactly what Reynolds has done with VUSE.
And
04:03:36
let me remind you what Dr. DiFranza told you.
04:03:38
He told you that "So if the tobacco
04:03:41
companies were to take over the manufacture of
04:03:45
electronic cigarettes, you know they would do it
04:03:47
right and that the product's going to be
consistent and it's not going to have any
contaminants."
04:03:50
04:03:53
04:03:55 4617
And that's exactly what Dr. Figlar told you
04:03:57
the goal of the three-year, 175 million dollar
04:04:01
to develop a product as VUSE was, to develop an
04:04:04
e-cigarette that delivered a consistent puff
04:04:06
every time, unlike the other products that are
04:04:09
out on the market.
04:04:12
And ultimately Reynolds is helping smokers
04:04:13
quit.
They went and bought Niconovum from
04:04:17
Dr. Fagerstrom.
They brought it to the United
04:04:22
States.
They went through the process of
04:04:26
getting FDA approval.
And to show the sincerity
04:04:29
with which they are pursuing helping smokers
quit should be obvious by the way in which
04:04:33
04:04:36
they're marketing the product.
They had to go
04:04:39
get FDA approval to market it in smaller package
04:04:41
sizes so that it would be cheaper and more
04:04:46
accessible to smokers.
In addition, they market
04:04:49
it in the same place that cigarettes are sold so
04:04:53
that when a smoker goes in they have the choice
04:04:55
whether to reach for Niconovum or a pack of
cigarettes, unlike a smoker having to decide
ahead of time I'm going to go to CVS or
04:05:00
04:05:03
04:05:06
Walgreens or someplace like that and lay down 85
04:05:10
bucks to get a whole regimen of nicotine
replacement therapy.
That was a barrier to
04:05:13
04:05:15 4618
people becoming involved with nicotine
replacement products.
So to remove that
04:05:18
04:05:20
barrier, Dr. Figlar explained to you Reynolds
04:05:28
markets it in a way that they think will
increase the likelihood that people will use
these products and quit.
You saw the
04:05:28
04:05:30
04:05:32
illustration of how it's marketed next to other
04:05:34
tobacco products.
04:05:37
You know, perhaps one of the most important
04:05:38
things you heard about today is that,
04:05:40
notwithstanding the documents that you saw in
04:05:43
the first phase, everything has changed at
04:05:45
Reynolds, everything has changed, including the
04:05:48
way it markets its products.
And you now know
04:05:50
that Reynolds is committed to preventing youth
04:05:54
tobacco use.
Skip that in the interest of time.
04:05:57
04:06:02
I want to remind you of where we are today
04:06:03
in 2014.
Dr. DiFranza, again during the
04:06:06
deposition that was read to you this morning,
04:06:10
told you that youth smoking is down by 80
04:06:12
percent, 80 percent.
Since 1997 when the Master
04:06:15
Settlement Agreement went into place and there
04:06:22
were marketing restrictions placed on the way
04:06:23
tobacco companies sell products, the youth
04:06:26 4619
smoking rates have dropped through the floor,
04:06:28
down by 80 percent.
That's Dr. DiFranza's
testimony.
04:06:31
04:06:36
But you know that Reynolds hasn't sat on the
04:06:36
sidelines and just watched all this happen.
04:06:39
Reynolds got involved and became proactive and
04:06:42
did its part to try to bring down youth smoking.
04:06:45
You heard that Reynolds restricts the way it
04:06:48
markets and advertises to adults voluntarily,
04:06:50
that Reynolds was one of the founders of the We
04:06:54
Card program and trains retail employees as to
04:06:57
how they should evaluate requests to purchase
04:06:59
tobacco products from underage people.
They
told -- and he told you about the Right
04:07:02
04:07:04
Decisions Right Now program, in which Reynolds
04:07:07
has funded the development of the materials that
04:07:10
are shared with middle schools and other people
04:07:15
across the country free of charge to help people
04:07:15
combat youth smoking.
You saw some examples of that.
You saw
04:07:19
04:07:21
examples of materials that were developed for
04:07:24
parents and grandparents to use when talking to
04:07:28
youth and examples of materials that were
created for use in middle schools.
You were
04:07:30
04:07:35
also told that there's a partnership with the
04:07:35 4620
Boy Scouts and with Big Brothers Big Sisters.
I
04:07:37
think he told you with the United Way also.
04:07:44
Reynolds is partnering with these organizations,
04:07:47
made the materials available so that they can be
04:07:50
distributed more broadly and so that this
04:07:53
decline of youth smoking can continue to come
04:07:57
down.
Dr. Figlar told you he wants to see that
04:08:00
reach zero some day, and that's the company's
04:08:03
belief as to what should happen.
Dr. Figlar also told you, I've summarized
04:08:06
04:08:08
some of his testimony here, that Reynolds warns
04:08:11
about the risk to discourage initiation and
promote quitting, that they have marketing
04:08:14
04:08:16
guidelines in place to avoid promoting tobacco
04:08:19
products to youth, that they've developed
04:08:21
smokeless products to reduce harm to users and
04:08:24
to people around them.
No secondhand smoke, no
04:08:27
secondhand smoke exposure to youth.
He told you
04:08:31
that Reynolds supports restrictions and
04:08:33
penalties for retailers to combat underage sales
04:08:37
and that they support tougher punishment for
04:08:40
underage users if they purchase cigarettes.
He
04:08:43
also told you about how they engage in and
support the youth prevention programs.
04:08:45
04:08:48
What more can they do, ladies and gentlemen?
04:08:50 What more can they do?
Thank you.
Okay.
It's come down 80 percent; youth

04:08:53
04:09:06
04:09:07
smoking has come down 80 percent.
Reynolds is
04:09:12
out there with the Right Decisions Right Now
program, the We Card program partnering with
04:09:15
04:09:19
groups like Big Brothers Big Sisters, all with
04:09:22
the hope that this youth smoking problem would
04:09:25
continue to drop.
04:09:27
You heard also that Reynolds has marketing
04:09:29
restrictions over and above the MSA
requirements.
I won't go through all these
04:09:32
04:09:35
again, but you heard they don't use models who
04:09:37
look under 25 years old, no athletes, no
celebrities, no people engaged in strenuous
activities, no ads that equate the use of
cigarettes with glamorization, with sexual
04:09:39
04:09:43
04:09:46
04:09:50
attractiveness, with success, with wealth, with
04:09:53
any of those advertising themes that you may
have seen in the first phase of the trial.
04:09:56
04:10:00
Everything has changed.
Cigarettes are marketed
04:10:03
entirely differently today than they were in the
04:10:06
'40s, '50s, '60s, '70s and even the '80s.
04:10:10
And what you've heard is that Reynolds' harm
04:10:15
reduction strategy aligns with public health
04:10:18 4622
recommendations.
What are those
recommendations?
Prevent initiation among youth and young
adults.
Reynolds tries to do that.
Promote quitting among adults and youth.
Reynolds tries to do that.
They even offer
nicotine replacement products.
04:10:21
04:10:24
04:10:24
04:10:30
04:10:33
04:10:37
And eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke.
04:10:38
Reynolds is proactively voluntarily involved
04:10:41
in doing all the types of things that people
04:10:44
believe can be used to drive down the impact of
04:10:47
tobacco -- excuse me, to drive down youth
smoking.
04:10:51
04:10:53
So when you get to this question of whether
04:10:55
punitive damages are needed to prevent Reynolds
04:10:59
from concealing information in 2014, I think
04:11:01
it's pretty clear that there's zero chance that
04:11:05
Reynolds is concealing information in 2014 or
04:11:10
that it will ever again conceal information.
It's impossible under the regulatory program
04:11:13
04:11:16
that we have now.
And you've heard the evidence
04:11:19
from Dr. Figlar, Reynolds makes no effort
04:11:23
whatsoever to conceal information from anybody.
04:11:25
Let's go back to our instruction, our
mitigating evidence instruction, instruction
04:11:29
04:11:33 4623
number 4, that's what we ask you to consider
when you consider the evidence today and
04:11:35
04:11:38
consider this instruction when evaluating the
04:11:40
punitive damage award.
Because, again, you'll
04:11:43
see that mitigating evidence is evidence which
04:11:46
may demonstrate that there's no need for
punitive damages or that a reduced amount of
punitive damages should be imposed.
So what have you heard?
You heard that
04:11:48
04:11:51
04:11:53
04:11:56
Reynolds is under the microscope with the FDA,
04:11:59
that they have to disclose everything they do in
04:12:02
every aspect of their business to the FDA.
04:12:06
Reynolds is completely transparent.
They write
04:12:10
it, the FDA gets it.
They have to disclose any
04:12:14
research related to smoking and health related
04:12:17
to addiction, product ingredients by brand,
content and delivery of nicotine by brand,
quantities of carcinogens and other harmful
constituents in tobacco products and tobacco
04:12:20
04:12:23
04:12:26
04:12:29
smoke.
It's a long, boring exhaustive list, but
04:12:31
the importance of it is that they have to
04:12:35
disclose everything they do and the FDA knows
04:12:37
everything about how they make, market and sell
04:12:40
their cigarettes and tells them how to do it
also.
04:12:43
04:12:47 4624
And then you heard some pretty unique
04:12:47
evidence.
I mean, it is one thing to be policed
04:12:49
by the FDA, but Reynolds actually has to pay the
04:12:52
policeman to police it.
04:12:54
And you've heard that just in the past four
04:12:57
years -- excuse me, in the four years between
04:12:59
2009 and 2012 Reynolds paid the FDA 321 million
04:13:02
dollars so that the FDA would have the resources
04:13:09
and personnel that it needed to do its job of
04:13:12
policing Reynolds.
Finally, you've heard that the FDA has
04:13:17
04:13:24
strong enforcement powers and Reynolds also pays
04:13:27
this policeman 320 million dollars who has the
04:13:31
power to come in, make unannounced inspections
04:13:35
of their plants, seize their product, close it
04:13:38
down, take whatever steps are necessary.
It's a
04:13:42
unique situation.
Now, I want to go back to something else
04:13:45
04:13:47
that was discussed during jury selection.
We
04:13:50
talked about how you were questioned and all of
04:13:53
you agreed that when people change they deserve
04:13:56
a fresh start.
There were another set of
questions that each and every one of you was
04:13:58
04:14:02
asked during jury selection and that is you were
04:14:04
asked whether you believe that when people pay
04:14:07 4625
their debt to society should their slate be
04:14:11
wiped clean?
And each of you agreed that once
04:14:15
someone has paid their debt to society their
04:14:19
slate should be wiped clean and they should be
04:14:22
given a second chances -- excuse me, a second
04:14:25
chance.
04:14:28
Well, then, ladies and gentlemen, isn't it
04:14:28
also true that when corporations pay their debt
04:14:33
to society their slate should be wiped clean?
04:14:36
The Court has instructed you that corporations
04:14:40
and people should be treated the same.
You've
04:14:45
agreed that people's slate should be wiped
clean, and we submit to you -- we ask you to
04:14:48
04:14:51
consider whether that same rule should apply to
04:14:54
corporations, because Reynolds sure has paid its
04:14:57
debt to society.
And you've heard about some of
04:15:01
that.
I'm going to review it quickly.
In that mitigation instruction, number 4,
04:15:03
04:15:04
04:15:06
you were given examples of mitigating evidence.
04:15:08
One of those examples is that you are instructed
04:15:11
to consider the total punishment that Reynolds
04:15:16
has received or is likely to receive from other
04:15:18
sources.
That is imbedded in your instructions.
04:15:21
And now you know the following about how
04:15:25 Reynolds has paid its debt to society.
Under the Master Settlement Agreement

04:15:28
04:15:32
Reynolds has paid 2 billion dollars to the State
04:15:35
of Florida since 1997 and a total of -- it's an
04:15:37
astounding number -- 42 billion dollars to all
04:15:43
of the states of this country since 1997 and
that these payments go on in perpetuity.
As
04:15:46
04:15:50
long as Reynolds is in business, it will make
04:15:53
these payments.
They never end.
04:15:55
And Dr. Figlar told you about all the good
04:15:59
that had been done with this money, how that 2
04:16:01
billion dollars had been used in the state of
04:16:04
Florida to fund a number of activities that
04:16:06
ultimately have resulted in decreases in youth
04:16:09
smoking rates in Florida.
You were told about another way that
04:16:11
04:16:20
Reynolds has paid its debt to society.
You were
04:16:22
told that Reynolds has defended about 120 Engle
04:16:24
cases in the state of Florida and that Reynolds
04:16:27
has already paid, paid, over 102 million dollars
04:16:30
in punitive damages in those cases.
04:16:35
I want to talk with you about the punitive
04:16:40
amount.
For a lot of reasons I hope you
conclude that there's no reason to pinish --
04:16:45
04:16:48
excuse me, to punish Reynolds farther in 2014.
04:16:51 4627
It's changed its ways, conducts business
04:16:56
differently.
It's already paid its debt, and
04:16:59
there's no further need for punishment.
Of
course I recognize that you decided that
Reynolds should be punished, so I'm going to
suggest an alternative to you as to a number
that might be appropriate to punish Reynolds
04:17:02
04:17:05
04:17:08
04:17:10
04:17:14
further something other than the one-day sale of
04:17:16
cigarettes, which really has nothing to do with
04:17:19
this case, of course.
And that's this:
You
04:17:22
awarded Ms. Odom $6,004,209 in the first phase.
04:17:26
You found Reynolds to be 75 percent responsible
04:17:34
for her death.
So that award comes out to be
04:17:38
really, really close to about four and a half
04:17:42
million dollars, the award that you made in the
04:17:45
first phase.
04:17:46
Do you remember the request that was made of
04:17:48
you by plaintiff's counsel in the first phase?
04:17:50
You were asked to do two things.
You were asked
04:17:54
to even the score and level the playing field.
04:17:58
Those were the two phrases that were used over
04:18:04
and over, "even the score" and "level the
04:18:08
playing field."
And plaintiff's counsel told
04:18:10
you how they thought you could do that.
They
04:18:13
asked you to award Ms. Odom $500,000 -- excuse
04:18:16 4628
me, 5 million dollars.
Their request to you in
04:18:21
the first phase was that you award 5 million
04:18:25
dollars and that that was an amount that would
04:18:28
level the playing field and even the score.
I'm
04:18:33
going to suggest to you that if you decide to
04:18:34
award punitive damages you should take them at
04:18:37
their word; you should award an additional
04:18:39
$500,000, an additional $500,000 that when added
04:18:42
to the 4.5 million you already awarded would
04:18:47
equal 5 million.
You would then have awarded a
04:18:51
total of 5 million dollars in this case, which
04:18:55
is the amount plaintiff's counsel told you was
04:18:58
required to level the playing field and even the
04:19:00
score.
As you consider that, I'd also ask you to
04:19:03
04:19:04
think about this, as you've been told, there are
04:19:07
over 5,000 Engle cases still pending, over
04:19:10
5,000.
If an award were made in each of those
04:19:17
cases of punitive damages of $500,000, if you do
04:19:20
the math, that alone would be 2.5 billion
04:19:24
dollars in punitive damages award, 2.5 billion
04:19:30
dollars if each plaintiff were to receive
$500,000.
04:19:36
04:19:39
The number that you were asked for today, 18
04:19:46
million, sort of winging this trying to do the
04:19:49 4629
math in my head a little bit, but if you
multiply 18 million by 5,000, if you were to
award 18 million in each of 5,000 cases I
believe that number comes out to 90 billion
04:19:52
04:19:55
04:19:58
04:20:01
dollars.
So you're essentially being asked to
04:20:05
use a yardstick that would result in 90 billion
04:20:07
dollars of punitive damages if applied to each
04:20:12
case, clearly an award that would financially
04:20:15
destroy Reynolds over and over and over and over
04:20:19
again.
But that's what you're being asked to
04:20:25
do.
04:20:28
There are the numbers.
Somebody did it for
04:20:29
me while I was talking.
04:20:33
Okay.
Where are we?
You've already fully
04:20:36
compensated Ms. Odom.
Punitive damages aren't
04:20:40
needed to make Reynolds stop concealing
04:20:43
information.
I mean, there's really no dispute
04:20:46
about that.
Counsel basically conceded that to
04:20:48
you in the argument she made a little while ago.
04:20:53
And if you award an additional $5,000 -- excuse
04:20:55
me, $500,000 ultimately prorated over all the
04:20:59
cases would result in another 2.5 billion
04:21:03
dollars worth of punishment.
So we suggest to
04:21:06
you that in an individual case like this
awarding more than that would be excessive.
04:21:09
04:21:11 4630
Okay.
I do want to address where counsel
04:21:16
ended, though.
Because counsel told you that we
04:21:20
were going to talk with you about what an award
04:21:24
would and would not achieve.
Now, I am going to
04:21:27
do that, because I want to ask you to think
about the following things.
Because you're
04:21:29
04:21:32
being asked to send a message, and I want you to
04:21:34
think about the message you're really being
asked to send.
And I want to ask you, even
04:21:37
04:21:39
though Reynolds has already changed the way it
04:21:42
does business, and I don't think there's any
dispute about that, the plaintiff wants more
04:21:44
04:21:46
punishment for the conduct of a long-time past,
04:21:48
in this case, conduct that ended 25 years ago.
04:21:50
Even though Reynolds has already paid its debt
04:21:55
to society, the plaintiff is asking you to
04:21:58
punish Reynolds over and over and over and over
04:22:00
again.
And the question is, you know, you were
04:22:03
told send a message to other corporations about
04:22:05
how to conduct themselves, what kind of message
04:22:08
would it send to other corporations if the
04:22:11
message is you completely changed your behavior,
04:22:13
you pay your debt to society but you still keep
04:22:19
getting punished over and over and over again no
04:22:24
matter what you do.
The message will be that if
04:22:28 4631
you change everything you still will be punished
04:22:30
over and over and over again.
And you have to
04:22:32
decide whether that's the message that you want
04:22:35
to send.
Finally, I want to talk with you about
whether punitive damages are needed to
04:22:37
04:22:39
04:22:42
accomplish any of the things that were suggested
04:22:44
to you this morning, this afternoon.
04:22:46
First of all, is a punitive award needed to
04:22:48
make Reynolds stop concealing information?
Of
04:22:51
course not.
There is no concealment.
There
hasn't been for a long time.
04:22:54
04:22:56
Would a punitive damage award improve public
04:22:59
health?
There's no evidence of that.
And
there's no conceivable way that awarding 18
04:23:03
04:23:05
million dollars to Ms. Odom is going to improve
04:23:08
public health.
Would it make more people aware of the
04:23:14
04:23:14
dangers of smoking, including youth?
No.
As
04:23:17
you heard, hundreds of millions of dollars are
04:23:20
being spent to do that already.
04:23:23
Would it stop people from beginning to smoke
04:23:25
or make more people quit?
No.
There are
04:23:29
programs all over the place and have been a long
04:23:30
time working on those issues.
A punitive award
04:23:31 4632
here won't accomplish anything.
04:23:32
Would it make Reynolds more transparent?
Of
04:23:35
course not.
Reynolds can't be any more
04:23:38
transparent.
It's fully transparent already.
04:23:41
And you have to ask yourself, would a large
04:23:43
punitive damage award serve any valid purpose in
04:23:48
this case?
04:23:50
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
That's all
04:23:51
I have.
I've enjoyed trying this case before
04:23:53
you; although I have to tell you, I hope I never
04:23:55
try another case while standing on a crutch like
04:23:59
I have in this trial.
Thank you very much.
