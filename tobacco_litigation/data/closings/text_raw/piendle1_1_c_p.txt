22                       CLOSING ARGUMENT
10             MR. BARNHART:  Good morning, ladies and
11        gentlemen of the jury, Counsel.
12             First let me say thank you, on behalf of
13        Mrs. Piendle, on behalf of myself, on behalf of
14        Jack Scarola, on behalf of Sia Baker-Barnes, on
15        behalf of Mr. Sales.  I'm sure I speak for
16        defense counsel too.
17             This is a large, big, important case, and
18        there's no way in closing argument we can cover
19        everything that's happened, and we don't intend
20        to.  But we've watched you, and each and every
21        one of you has paid close attention, taken good
22        notes, and thank goodness we can rely upon
23        that.
24             Now, one thing.  This is closing argument.
25        It's going to be more adversarial, and anything

 1        I say or anything that Jack Scarola says or
 2        anything that Sia Baker-Barnes says, it's not
 3        intended as a slight against defense counsel.
 4        They're excellent lawyers and they have done a
 5        fine job for their clients.  But closing
 6        argument is a time to determine and separate
 7        truth from falsity, sense from nonsense, lies
 8        from deceit, illusion from reality.
 9             Now, if you'll remember, about a month
10        ago, I came in front of you in the courtroom
11        right next door, and I told you that we were
12        here for the death of a fine man, and that you
13        would hear no evidence other than that.  And we
14        are indeed here for the death of a fine man,
15        and you have heard no evidence other than that.
16             Now, you sit as a jury and you've watched
17        us and you've seen objections and you've seen
18        arguments and so on, but the decision is yours.
19        And so you sit collectively as the
20        representatives of the state of Florida, of the
21        United States of America, and you have immense
22        power.  When you go back in there tomorrow, in
23        that jury room, you have the immense power to 24        right a wrong, to do what people have been
25        doing in England and in the United States for

 1        1200 years.  You have the power to do what's
 2        right.
 3             Now, folks, I want to tell you that how --
 4        I want to talk about the way in which you do
 5        this.  The way you do this is you follow the
 6        law.  And so let's start from the beginning.
 7        When we started this case, we told you that
 8        this was an Engle progeny case; in other words,
 9        it comes from an Engle class action, and this
10        case didn't start yesterday.  This case started
11        in the 1950s, really when all the actions were
12        done, and we're going to go through that.
13             It goes to court in the -- the lawsuit is
14        filed in 1994, it goes to court in 1999, and
15        the Florida Supreme Court makes its decision,
16        and we're really at the end of 2006, early
17        2007.  And then people were given the
18        opportunity to file a lawsuit within that next
19        year if they believed they fell within that
20        class, and that's when this lawsuit was filed
21        on behalf of Charlie Piendle.
22             And in the very first paper that was filed
23        in this case, when we walked down to this
24        courthouse, we admitted, on behalf of Charlie
25        Piendle, that he himself shared fault, that he

 1        himself beared responsibility for what he did,
 2        but that's not the end of the story, because
 3        tobacco denies any fault, not a smidgen, not an
 4        iota, not an iota, not a sliver of fault, and
 5        that's why we're here.
 6             All right.  So we heard the judge, and
 7        let's talk a little bit about what the law is
 8        as you approach your job.  The first and
 9        primary issue, was addiction to cigarettes
10        manufactured by R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris
11        a legal cause of Charlie Piendle's death?  A
12        legal cause.  And we'll explain that.  Let's go
13        to the concurring cause.
14             All right.  So here are the instructions
15        that you saw, you have them with you, but I
16        want to work through them because it gives you
17        an easy way to weigh the evidence, to follow
18        the evidence, and see what goes on.
19             Addiction to cigarettes containing
20        nicotine is a legal cause of death if it
21        directly and in natural and continuous sequence
22        produces or contributes substantially, it
23        doesn't have to be the only cause, but
24        contributes substantially to producing the
25        death, so that it can be said that but for the

 1        addiction -- but for the addiction to
 2        cigarettes containing nicotine, the death would
 3        not have occurred.
 4             All right.  And to be regarded as a legal
 5        cause of death, addiction need not be the only
 6        cause, and we know it's not, because the
 7        actions of Charlie Piendle were part of the
 8        cause and the actions of tobacco were part of  9        the cause.
10             Addiction may be a legal cause of death,
11        even though it operates in combination with the
12        act of another, Charlie Piendle, R.J. Reynolds,
13        Philip Morris, some natural cause or some other
14        cause if the addiction contributes
15        substantially to Charlie's death.
16             Okay.  So what is the addiction?  It's
17        combined with Charlie's actions, with tobacco's
18        actions.  But to put this case in context, if
19        we weigh it into what goes on in 2010, we're
20        not doing justice.  Because what happens is
21        Charlie Piendle started smoking, when, in the
22        1950s.  He was born in 1941, and it was a
23        different time, a different time.
24             Remember in opening statement when I
25        pulled out a cigarette, it was shocking, it was

 1        jarring, but that was the milieu, that was the
 2        time in which Charlie grew up, when everybody
 3        was smoking, when we had -- people smoked in
 4        the hospitals, people smoked on airplanes,
 5        people smoked at the doctor's office, doctors
 6        smoked, people smoked in schools, teachers and
 7        principals, they smoked everywhere.  We had
 8        nurses, famous coaches, people in orchestras,
 9        people of everyday life, priests and clergy.
10        Well, we heard in this case that their priest
11        smoked cigars, that their doctor who made house
12        calls would show up smoking a cigarette, you
13        heard Betty Piendle say that.  People smoked
14        during athletic activities.  Arnold Palmer
15        smoking away during a tennis tournament.
16        People smoked traveling.  They smoked
17        everywhere.
18             And to put this in study again, if we
19        were -- if we were back in that time, people in
20        the audience would be smoking.  You would have
21        ashtrays right here.  Somebody would be
22        smoking.  Maybe I would, maybe the Court would.
23        But it was a different time.
24             And so when we weigh Charlie's activities,
25        when we weigh a decision he made as a kid, we

 1        need to weigh it at the time when he lived, at
 2        the time when he was young, at the time when
 3        all of the influences around him counted the
 4        most.
 5             All right.  So let's go back to the 1950s
 6        and talk about it statistically.  In the 1950s
 7        nearly 80 percent of all men smoked.  So
 8        remember, that was the World War II generation,
 9        just above Charlie.  Everybody had gone to war,
10        and what did they get, free cigarettes in their
11        rations, free cigarettes on their ships if
12        you're in the Navy, free cigarettes on the
13        beaches if you were a Marine.  80 percent of
14        the men who fought in World War II, 80 percent
15        of all men in the United States were smokers,
16        regular smokers.
17             Charlie grew up in a haze of smoke.  It
18        was what happened, it was not anything unusual.
19        Dad smoked, Mom smoked, the kids down the 20        street smoked, the teacher smoked, the firemen
21        smoked, the police officer smoked, priests
22        smoked, doctors, nurses, everybody smoked.
23             All right.  So by the time, we know from a
24        poll, we don't particularly know about
25        Bridgeport, the national high school classes of

 1        1958 and 1959, Charlie was the class of '59, 65
 2        to 68 percent of the kids were regular smokers.
 3        I don't mean experimenting out behind the
 4        bleachers, I mean regular smokers.  Regular
 5        smokers.
 6             All right.  So going back, here is
 7        Charlie.  So what do we know about Charlie?
 8        And when you evaluate the impact of the loss of
 9        Charlie Piendle on his wife Liz -- on your way
10        there.  When we evaluate the loss of Charlie
11        for Liz, we have to go back and see what kind
12        of a man Charlie was.  Right?
13             No one in this courtroom other than Liz
14        knew Charlie, but to evaluate the loss to Liz,
15        we have to understand Charlie, we have to get
16        to know him, we have to understand what that
17        loss meant to her.
18             Well, who was Charlie?  Well, he was a
19        good-looking kid.  He was a nice kid.  We saw
20        his grade card, he wasn't the best student, but
21        he was a good athlete.  He was a popular kid.
22        He was captain of the track team.  He was a
23        football -- I don't know if he was a football
24        star, but he was the starting halfback on the
25        football team.  His best friend Babe, we heard

 1        him testify, Babe was a star, and they were
 2        best friends growing up.  And so what was he?
 3        He was different things.  He was a Marine, he
 4        was a member of the school, and he wasn't stuck
 5        up and he wasn't conceited.  He was just a nice
 6        guy.
 7             And how do we know that?  Because the
 8        friends he made in high school are his -- were
 9        his best friends all his life, all his life.
10             Remember Babe who came down?  The very
11        last question, one of the defense lawyers asked
12        him about why he was here, and he said, I'm
13        here for my friend.  I'm here for my friend.
14             And when you have a man who inspires that
15        kind of loyalty, that kind of love, even 14
16        years after his death, that's a remarkable man,
17        and that's a terrible loss.
18             All right.  So I wanted to talk -- we --
19        you know, we talked about the time, but now
20        let's talk about the ads.  And, look, the judge
21        told you there's nothing wrong with
22        advertising, and there's not.  There's not.
23        You can advertise.  There's nothing wrong with
24        that.  But what you cannot do, what you cannot
25        do is false, misleading, deceitful advertising

 1        and representations are not protected by the
 2        First Amendment.  You know why, because they're
 3        wrong.  You can advertise, you can puff, so to
 4        speak, but you can't lie, and you can't  5        mislead.
 6             All right.  So what are some of the
 7        advertisements we've seen?  Lucky Strikes,
 8        prom, 1952.  And these were everywhere.  They
 9        were in magazines; they were in newspapers;
10        they were on billboards.
11             And remember what Babe said?  Right across
12        from the candy story where they got their penny
13        cigarettes, you know, kids would go in, plunk
14        down a penny, get a cigarette and a match,
15        penny cigarettes.  And right across the street
16        from that was a billboard of the Marlboro Man.
17             And what did Babe say?  Everybody wanted
18        to be the Marlboro Man.  Everybody wanted to be
19        there, because he was a tough ombré.  He was a
20        man's man.  He was an American, square-jawed,
21        tough, independent, the kind of person that
22        conquered the west.  And what teenager -- or
23        what child would not want to be like that?
24             We have sports figures.  John Wayne.  We
25        have doctor's advertising.  The defense keeps

 1        saying -- you know, there are warnings
 2        everywhere.  He had to know more than tobacco
 3        as a kid.  We have doctors.  "More doctors
 4        smoke Camels than any other cigarette."  How
 5        did they get that?  Remember what Dr. Cummings
 6        said, how did they get that poll, so to speak?
 7             The doctors had a convention, and they put
 8        Camel cigarettes in their rooms.  And then when
 9        they ran out of their cigarettes, they had the
10        Camels.  They came down, and said, Doctor, what
11        cigarette is in your pocket?  That's how they
12        got them on Camels.
13             They advertised 28 percent less nicotine,
14        more sports figures.  We had -- is it Don
15        Newcombe and Roy Campanella?  They don't mean
16        much to us now, but to Charlie they did.  That
17        was Lebron James, that was Dwayne Wade, that
18        was Dan Marino, that was Frank Gifford.
19             So to put it in context, to do what's
20        right, to be fair, to understand the
21        responsibility Charlie had, compared to the
22        responsibility tobacco has, we need to see the
23        information environment that he lived in.
24        Remember that, and that's when -- the
25        cross-examination of their polster and the

 1        cross-examination of their historian, this came
 2        out.
 3             So here's Charlie in the 1950s and let's
 4        look and see what are his influences.  Well,
 5        the number one influence are his parents, of
 6        course, his siblings, his teachers, his
 7        neighborhood, his friends, his neighbors, his
 8        peers, his school, the military.  Military was
 9        big back then.  We were just out of World
10        War II.  We had beaten the bad guys.  The
11        American Navy ruled the waves.  The American
12        Army conquered.  The U.S. Marines were tough.
13        That was in the 1940s, 1950s.  Big heros.
14             TV started in the early 1950s, and it was
15        saturated with TV ads.  And then doctors, we 16        talk about doctors.  So what do we have,
17        billboards, newspapers and magazines, and from
18        the annual report of Philip Morris and RJR -- I
19        can't remember which one it was, in the '50s,
20        1957, 3 billion messages that year.  That's one
21        company, and you see it has a synergistic
22        effect, because although he didn't smoke
23        cigarettes from other companies, they all did
24        it.  They all advertised.  And every Cigarette
25        Company advertised sex, cool, sophisticated,

 1        manly, boy meets girl.  That was the story.
 2             All right.  This is Frank Gifford.  We can
 3        start it.
 4             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
 5        transcribed as follows:)
 6             MR. GIFFORD:  Some fun, I sure hope you
 7        get a chance to try it sometime.  Here's
 8        something else you ought to try, and soon,
 9        Lucky Strike.  Why?  Because if you like taste
10        in your cigarette, you'll get it with Luckys.
11        This is all the taste a smoker could want.
12        It's rich and smooth, the taste of fine
13        tobacco.  And let me tell you, once you start
14        getting that taste, you'll want to keep getting
15        it --
16             MR. BARNHART:  Because you're addicted.
17             MR. GIFFORD:  -- so come on, get that fine
18        tobacco taste.  Get Lucky, the taste to start
19        with --
20             MR. BARNHART:  He was the biggest star.
21             MR. GIFFORD:  -- the taste to stay with.
22        Get Lucky Strike.
23             MR. BARNHART:  The biggest star, the Dan
24        Marino of his life.
25             NARRATOR:  It takes a steady hand and a

 1        quick mind to put a jet fighter plane through
 2        its paces.  Every jet pilot is given intensive
 3        training at some of the most modern airbases in
 4        the world . . .  Try them for 30 days.  You'll
 5        discover --
 6             MR. BARNHART:  For 30 days.
 7             NARRATOR:  -- Camel's rich flavor --
 8             MR. BARNHART:  Dr. Benowitz, get addicted.
 9        Try them for 30 days.
10             NARRATOR:  -- and cool mildness continue
11        to please you pack after pack.  You'll see why
12        Camel is America's most popular cigarette.
13        Leads all other brands by billions of
14        cigarettes per year.
15             BANKER:  . . . with Winston's filter blend
16        up front, it's like money in the bank --
17             MR. BARNHART:  Beverly Hillbillies was the
18        most popular show on TV in its time.
19             BANKER:  You're going to like Winstons.
20             MR. CLAMPETT:  I reckon I'll decide that
21        for myself.
22             BANKER:  Yes, sir.
23             MR. CLAMPETT:  Uhm, I like it.  This here
24        Winston tastes good . . .
25             MS. LONDON:  . . . you get a lot to like
6821  1        with a Marlboro filtered, flavored, pack or
 2        box.
 3             MR. RUBBEL:  Gee, we ought to do
 4        something --
 5             MR. BARNHART:  Sexy, cool, sophisticated,
 6        even the little fist bump with the cigarette.
 7        It's very well done.  There's no question about
 8        it.
 9             MR. RUBBEL:  -- Fred.
10             MR. FLINTSTONE:  Okay.  How's about taking
11        a nap?
12             MR. RUBBLE:  Hey, I got a better idea,
13        let's take a Winston break.
14             MR. FLINTSTONE:  That's it.  Winston is
15        the one filtered cigarette that delivers flavor
16        20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter
17        blend.
18             MR. RUBBLE:  Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend
19        makes the big taste difference and only Winston
20        has it, up front where it counts.  Here, ahead
21        of the pure white filter . . .
22             MR. FLINTSTONE:  . . . Winston tastes good
23        like a cigarette should.
24             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)
25             MR. BARNHART:  Now, that was, in its time,

 1        the number one TV show, and it was shown at
 2        night.  It was prime time.  And who watched it?
 3        A lot of people did.  But who primarily watched
 4        it?  Kids and teenagers.  It just covered the
 5        media, saturated the media.
 6             All right.  So that puts us into the time.
 7             So what is the evidence you-all saw on
 8        addiction, going back in time, realizing where
 9        Charlie grew up, how he grew up, what he
10        thought.  The evidence on addiction causing
11        death came from three experts, and let's talk
12        about them.
13             These were three of the most qualified
14        experts in the world.  I mean, it really bears
15        scrutiny as to who came to testify for you.
16        What did Neal Benowitz -- if you'll recall,
17        he's published almost 400 peer review
18        documents -- peer-reviewed articles.  That
19        means -- and we've heard about this, and some
20        of you know the process of peer review.  You
21        can't just willy-nilly throw off an article and
22        it gets published.  It has to go to judges who
23        are leaders in their field, leaders in their
24        field.
25             He's a peer reviewer himself.  He lectured

 1        all over the world on nicotine, on addiction,
 2        on substances.  He's board-certified in three
 3        specialties.  He's written over 80 chapters in
 4        books.  He didn't look that old.  Frankly, I
 5        don't see how he did it.  But eighty chapters
 6        in books.  He was involved in seven Surgeon
 7        General's reports.  He was the senior editor of
 8        the Landmark 1988 Surgeon General's report,
 9        which did what?  Link addiction -- addiction to
10        nicotine to all other addictions, alcohol,
11        cocaine, heroin.  Put it in that class as a 12        matter of medical science.
13             So what did he say?  Cigarette smoke is
14        addictive; nicotine's is a responsible culprit;
15        the physiological processes are similar to
16        other drug addictions; nicotine is highly
17        addictive, and I believe he used 80 to
18        90 percent of the people who used nicotine
19        regularly are addicted.  You remember that.
20             Compare that to alcohol.  Now, many people
21        drink alcohol.  Not many people are alcoholics.
22        It's 10 percent or lower.  Nicotine, 80 to 90
23        percent of the people, regular smokers, become
24        addicted.  Does everybody?  No.  Some people
25        are lucky.  But a regular smoker, eight to nine

 1        out of ten become addicted.
 2             Okay.  And he's consulted with a number of
 3        organizations around the world, the National
 4        Cancer Institute, the EPA, and so on.
 5             David Burns.  David Burns was our first
 6        witness in this case, as you'll recall, a long
 7        time ago.  It's been a month-long trial.  David
 8        Burns, medical school at Dartmouth, medical
 9        school at Harvard.  And he took -- he studied
10        from Harrison's, as do all doctors, all
11        fledgling doctors, in the United States and
12        probably in a lot of countries, Harrison's or
13        Cecil.  That's your basic textbook.  And he
14        studied from it at Dartmouth and Harvard.
15             He wrote -- and he wrote chapters on
16        nicotine in those books and at the time he
17        became a star in his field.  So when the new
18        doctors at Harvard and Dartmouth and the
19        University of Florida and University of Miami
20        are studying to become doctors, they're reading
21        chapters written by Dr. Burns.
22             He was the senior editor of the 1975 and
23        1976 Surgeon General's reports.  And then he
24        had an important role.  It varied, but an
25        important role in every single Surgeon General

 1        report thereafter, except for a couple, '75,
 2        '76, '79, '80, '81, '82, '84, '85, '87, '88,
 3        '01 and '04.  And every one of those Surgeon
 4        General's reports were attacked by tobacco, and
 5        we're going to see the evidence.  Don't take my
 6        word for it.  You've seen it.  We're going to
 7        put it together, and we're going to see the
 8        documents, and you'll watch that attack as part
 9        of a coordinated plan.
10             You know, it's rare that you get a case
11        where you have actual documents showing a
12        conspiracy, a cover up, a plan.  Most cases are
13        like footprints in the sand.  You have to piece
14        it together.  Not here.  Not here.  You are
15        going to see it in their own words.
16             All right.  Let's go to the next one.
17             Then we brought Dr. Michael Cummings, and
18        he's a Ph.D. kind of doctor.  He's at the
19        Roswell Cancer Institute, and he has written
20        almost 270 peer-reviewed articles.  So when you
21        put these experts together, folks, we're
22        talking about a thousand, approximately, 23        peer-reviewed articles from the people that
24        came before you.
25             He served on editorial boards of the two

 1        leading cancer journals.  He's the director of
 2        New York State's smoking cessation line.  And
 3        what did they have -- something like a million
 4        people have gone through it, something like
 5        that.  It's the oldest Cancer hospital in the
 6        country.  He got 50 -- what was it -- 57 grants
 7        for over $57 million for the Roswell Cancer
 8        Institute.  He was the author, senior editor
 9        and senior author of the 1988 and 1999 Surgeon
10        General's reports.
11             And then -- and you'll see what happened.
12        And tobacco said, look, we've done a lot of
13        good things.  We put -- we put warnings on
14        cigarette -- cigarette packages.  Well, sure,
15        because they were forced to by law.  You'll see
16        from the facts that everything they did, all
17        the manufacturing changes they did were either
18        required by an act of Congress, forced by a
19        lawsuit, or done to maximize profit.  Every
20        single one of the things they did.
21             And so, he, Dr. Cummings, is the
22        repository of millions of documents from the
23        State Attorney's General who sued the tobacco
24        companies and forced them to produce the
25        documents which you've seen in this court and

 1        you'll see now.  Thank you.
 2             Okay.  So who did tobacco bring to talk
 3        about addiction?  We heard about each one of
 4        these folks.  Tobacco brought nobody, nobody to
 5        say that Charlie was not addicted.
 6             Now, look, tobacco has the resources, and
 7        they certainly have the lawyers who can find an
 8        expert around this country to have said Charlie
 9        Piendle was not addicted.
10             MR. KELLY:  Your Honor --
11             MR. BARNHART:  And they didn't.
12             MR. KELLY:  Your Honor, it's improper to
13        reference resources of the various parties.
14             THE COURT:  I'll sustain, and ask the jury
15        to disregard that statement by counsel.
16             MR. BARNHART:  Thank you, your Honor.
17             We know that the experts they did bring
18        came from Las Vegas, Nevada, right, and from
19        Tennessee -- Knoxville, Tennessee.  They
20        brought nobody.  Nobody.
21             Okay.  So what was the testimony that you
22        heard, without a doubt, according to Dr. Burns,
23        according to Dr. Cummings, without a doubt,
24        addiction was a contributing cause of his
25        death.  Now, what are you going to do with

 1        evidence of that -- like that?  It's all --
 2        it's not just the greater weight of the
 3        evidence.  There's none on the other side.
 4             So the evidence on that is very clear, but
 5        we need to see how that affected -- because
 6        it's not just whether he was addicted, it's how
 7        it affected his behavior and the behavior of  8        everybody else they studied and who was
 9        addicted to cigarettes.  Addiction drove his
10        smoking.
11             When an addicted smoker smokes, there's a
12        drive.  It's the drive for addiction.  It's the
13        core.  It's the critical element to what a
14        smoker does.  It's the critical element to why
15        somebody will smoke 20 or 30 or 40 cigarettes a
16        day for ten, 15, 20, 40, 50 years.  Your
17        control is affected and, as we'll see, most
18        smokers want to quit and want to -- and regret
19        the day they started.  And it's no longer a
20        free choice.  It's not impossible, nobody ever
21        said that it was impossible to quit smoking
22        cigarettes.  We know people do it.  Many people
23        have done it.  Millions of people have done it.
24        But it's difficult.  It's doggone difficult.
25        It's hard.  And as Charlie said to his family,

 1        it's the hardest thing he ever did.
 2             When we picked the jury, you heard that
 3        from some of the smokers who smoked a long
 4        time:  It was a hard, hard thing to do from an
 5        addicted smoker.
 6             And the relapse rate, unfortunately, well,
 7        you can quit, but the relapse rate is tough.
 8        So people have quit for a day, a week, a month,
 9        a year, sometimes many years, but the relapse
10        rate is high.
11             Okay.  And that brings us to the circle of
12        addiction, which you saw, but it's a good graph
13        to show things.  People experiment.  Kids,
14        usually, experiment.
15             Can you see Mr. Tad-Y?
16             JUROR TAD-Y:  Yes.
17             MR. BARNHART:  As they smoke more
18        cigarettes and they become more and more
19        addicted, their choice, their free choice
20        diminishes, until they get to the point where
21        they're addicted, and then you have daily use
22        and physical dependence.
23             Could you go to the next one?
24             Then, what do we have?  We have a cycle of
25        addiction.  That's why people smoke so much,

 1        smoke so regularly.  There are actual physical
 2        changes.  There are brain changes in the brain
 3        of smokers.  You heard Dr. Benowitz talk about
 4        tolerance, and tolerance is -- most people who
 5        have tried cigarettes had an unpleasant
 6        experience.  They either get sick or they don't
 7        like it.
 8             They certainly couldn't start smoking two
 9        packs a day, for example, when you're kid.
10        You'd become deathly ill, but you develop
11        tolerance over time.  Then you develop a
12        compulsion, a physical compulsion, a physical
13        craving to have cigarettes, and then you
14        develop withdrawal symptoms, which are -- range
15        from very unpleasant to dreadful.  They're
16        awful.  And then it goes hand in glove with the
17        psychological effects.  People like the high.
18        It relaxes people.  It stimulates them. 19        Remember that?  It targets the pleasure center.
20        So the brain secretes dopamine, and all the
21        other pleasure hormones that Dr. Benowitz
22        talked about.
23             But over time, over time, that constant
24        bath of nicotine causes the body to reach an
25        equilibrium where the body lowers its own

 1        natural production of dopamine, and that causes
 2        withdrawal symptoms.  So in a daily cycle, even
 3        though people don't think, gosh, I'm going
 4        through withdrawal, they think or they feel
 5        it's time for a cigarette.
 6             And if you -- an addicted smoker, a
 7        regular smoker takes them out, depends on how
 8        addicted they are, you take your cigarettes out
 9        for two hours or one hour, three hours, first
10        thing they do, they're fumbling with their
11        cigarettes when they get out of whatever it is,
12        movie, church, a restaurant.  That's now.
13             I mean, you heard testimony from Liz and
14        Tracy.  Their daughter was a gifted gymnast,
15        and she had dance recitals and so on.  Can't
16        smoke there, now not, not a cute little girl.
17        As soon as there was an intermission, mom and
18        dad were out there smoking cigarettes, because
19        they had the craving, because withdrawal
20        symptoms started.
21             All right.  So let's talk about the brain
22        changes.  And there was an issue that one of
23        you raised, and it was a very good one, and
24        that is what are short-term brain changes and
25        what are the long-term brain changes.  And this

 1        is a video of Dr. Benowitz about three weeks
 2        ago in front of you.
 3             If you could.
 4             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
 5        transcribed as follows:)
 6        Q.   "And what are the permanent brain changes
 7   called?"
 8        A.   "Well, again" --
 9             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)
10             MR. KELLY:  Your Honor, this is from the
11        testimony in court.  It's impermissible to show
12        any videos of what occurred in court.  A
13        transcript is the only record that can be used.
14             MR. BARNHART:  The transcript is right
15        here, your Honor.
16             THE COURT:  Counsel can approach.
17             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
18        held out of the presence of the jury:)
19             MR. BARNHART:  I thought -- I thought you
20        had --
21             THE COURT REPORTER:  Wait, hold on a
22        second, it's so loud in my ear, it's blaring.
23             MR. BARNHART:  You need a statute, case
24        law without using video -- you have the
25        transcript.

 1             MR. KELLY:  I'd be happy to give it to
 2        you.  The reason I didn't use any of it, I
 3        looked to see if there was a rule, and there's  4        one right on point.
 5             THE COURT:  You have to bring that, yeah.
 6             MR. BARNHART:  It's just one question and
 7        one answer.
 8             MR. KELLY:  We gave it to you this
 9        morning, your Honor.
10             THE COURT:  Apparently, it's just the one
11        question and answer.
12             So do you want to just move on then?  If
13        they're objecting and there's a -- all -- I
14        need time to look at it.
15             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was
16        concluded and the following proceedings were
17        held within the presence of the jury:)
18             MR. BARNHART:  Tell you what, here's what
19        we'll do, go ahead and turn off the sound, and
20        we'll read it.
21             Okay.  So here was the question from
22        Dr. -- that I posed to Dr. Benowitz:
23             "What are the permanent brain changes
24        called?"
25             Answer:  "Well, again, the technical term

 1        for it is neuroplasticity, which really means
 2        that you're developing new brain circuits."
 3             "Thank you."
 4             And we had, if you'll remember, we had
 5        Dr. Benowitz --
 6             Christine, I don't want to smash you.
 7             And I wrote down some of the things
 8        Dr. Benowitz said.  And Dr. Benowitz said,
 9        you're most vulnerable to addiction when you're
10        young, when you're a youth.  The average age
11        people start is 14 to 15 years, and that
12        80 percent of the smokers are regular smokers,
13        not experimenting, regular smokers by the time
14        they're 18.
15             And then I ask him, "Well, is this an
16        informed decision, based upon all your
17        research, based upon everything you've done,
18        based upon your evaluation with an involvement
19        with the Surgeon General?"
20             He said, "No, it's not an informed
21        decision."
22             Teenagers -- I mean, do we need an expert
23        to say it?  The teenager brain is
24        physiologically not fully developed.  They can
25        be big, but the judgment centers are affected,

 1        and children's brains top out at about age 20,
 2        21, 22, depending on who you are.  That's why
 3        teenagers do so many dumb things.  Their
 4        judgment centers are affected.  But it's not an
 5        informed decision for somebody who is 12, 13,
 6        14, 15.
 7             And then he said, "Teens underestimate how
 8        much they'll smoke and whether they'll get
 9        addicted."  Right?
10             So that's actually the decision.  They see
11        all this stuff.  It's really cool.  It's really
12        sexy.  I want to be cool.  I want to be sexy.
13        I want to look good.  I want my self-image to
14        be good.  But they don't understand how much 15        they're going to smoke, and they have no clue
16        about addiction.
17             And what are the stages of somebody who's
18        starting, a kid who's starting?  He prepares.
19        There's a trial and experimental phase.  Then
20        they start regular use, and within 30 days it's
21        regular use, and most kids are addicted.
22             Okay.  And he said, look, nicotine is a
23        drug addiction, pure and simple.  There's --
24        and it involves, like any drug addiction, a
25        loss of control.  It's a disease of the brain

 1        reward centers, the hormones receptors, and the
 2        average number of attempts before someone is
 3        finally able to quit, the average number is
 4        five.  Five.  That's how strong the addiction
 5        is.
 6             And then he was talking about -- we talk
 7        about the cycle of addiction, which we just
 8        covered, and then he talked about
 9        neuroplasticity, which are the long-term brain
10        changes.  And then we talked about
11        rationalization and denial.
12             Why with withdrawal do we rationalize?
13        Why do we deny something that a nonsmoker today
14        can see clearly?  Because we want a crutch, as
15        tobacco puts it, a psychological crutch.
16             All right.  So let's talk about levels of
17        addiction, if we could.  We found out from all
18        the evidence, and I summarize it all right
19        here, that more heavily addicted people start
20        at a younger age; that heavier smokers are more
21        heavily addicted; that a cigarette the first
22        thing in the morning is the hallmark of
23        addiction; and that those who have smoked for a
24        long time are the most heavily addicted and,
25        conversely, the less heavily addicted are just

 1        the other way, they're older, they're light
 2        smokers.  They don't smoke their first
 3        cigarette as soon as they get up out of bed or
 4        right when they have their coffee.  They smoke
 5        for less time.  It's exposure related, in other
 6        words.
 7             Okay.  So where does Charlie Piendle fit?
 8        Well, if you'll remember the Fagerstrom test,
 9        based on Dr. Fagerstrom, you saw it a couple of
10        times.  You saw it with Dr. Benowitz, and then
11        you saw it when Liz Piendle testified.
12             Now, let's go back.  This is the
13        Fagerstrom test used by people involved in
14        addiction medicine.  It's the gold standard, if
15        you will, and let's take Charlie through this.
16             How soon, after you wake up, do you first
17        smoke your first cigarette?  That's question
18        No. 1 because it's the most important.
19             All right.  Liz Piendle:  "We both had
20        cigarettes on the side of our bed."  You know,
21        their ashtrays and smoking stuff on either side
22        of the bedstand.  Smoked at night, they smoked
23        first thing in the morning.
24             Ted Cabral, Babe Cabral:  "First thing in
25        the morning." 6838
 1             Eddie Piendle:  "First thing with coffee,
 2        right away."
 3             So within five minutes, maybe six minutes,
 4        it's either a three or a two.  Charlie Piendle,
 5        most important.
 6             So let's go to the second question.  "Do
 7        you find it difficult to defrain -- refrain,"
 8        excuse me, "from smoking in places where it's
 9        forbidden?"
10             We heard Liz, and we heard Tracy.  They
11        could barely sit through Tracy's recital.
12        First night out, bang, they'd be right outside
13        smoking.
14             Third question.  "Which cigarette would
15        you hate to give up in the morning?"
16             Well, we don't have Charlie to say that.
17        Liz said, "I think it would have been the first
18        one when he got up in the morning."
19             And I'm sure she's right.  But let's give
20        them that because we don't have Charlie, and
21        I'm sure they never talked about, "Charlie,
22        which cigarette is most important to you?"
23        That's something most people wouldn't talk
24        about.
25             Let's go to the next one.

 1             How many cigarettes per day do you smoke?
 2             Well, there's evidence back and forth.
 3        Liz said, clearly, between 31 or more.  When
 4        they were cutting back, it was less.  Most of
 5        the time it was two packs a day.
 6             How do we know that?  Well, medical
 7        records are in evidence, okay?
 8             Most of these medical records are from the
 9        VA when Charlie Piendle went in to be treated
10        for lung cancer, and Charlie Piendle did not
11        want to die.  We can see that in the records.
12        And he told -- he told the doctors that.
13             So what he did to help him, to help his
14        recovery, we hope, is that they give a history
15        to a doctor, and the thing you tell your doctor
16        when he's trying to save your life is the
17        truth.  It's long before any lawsuits, long
18        before anything.
19             So what did he tell his doctor?  One,
20        smoker, one pack a day, smoked age 16 to 48.
21        That's when you become a regular smoker.  40 to
22        45-pack smoking history.  Those are pack years.
23        40 to 45, packs per day, 40 to 45, 50-pack
24        years.  You have different doctors give
25        different things.  Smoking two packs per day,

 1        two packs per day for many years, two packs of
 2        cigarettes per day for many years.  They just
 3        smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for many
 4        years, two packs of cigarettes, two packs of
 5        cigarettes, two packs of cigarettes, two packs
 6        of cigarettes.  He smoked a lot.  He clearly
 7        smoked, going back to the Fagerstrom test, the
 8        highest amount.
 9             Let's go to our next question.  Do you
10        smoke more frequently during the first hours 11        after awakening than during the rest of the
12        day?
13             Now, why is that an important question,
14        just like the first cigarette in the morning?
15        Because that is when withdrawal is at its most
16        keen moment.  Right?
17             You don't have nicotine bathing your brain
18        and you crave it, you need it, and that's why
19        it's the most dear.
20             Well, what did Liz say?  Yes, in the
21        morning.  Why?  To replenish the nicotine
22        levels.
23             Let's go on to the next one.
24             And do you smoke even if you are so ill
25        that you are in bed?  Okay.  So remember what

 1        the evidence is about this.
 2             Charlie Piendle had Crohn's disease,
 3        doesn't have anything to do with this case,
 4        it's an autoimmune disorder, your body attacks
 5        your intestinal tract.  So what we know from
 6        the evidence is, is really painful.  There's
 7        nothing worse than when your guts are hurting,
 8        when you feel sick, when you feel nauseated,
 9        when you feel like you have diarrhea, that's an
10        awful feeling.  People don't leave the bathroom
11        when it's bad.
12             Charlie had severe occurrences of it.  He
13        had to leave the Marine Corps because of the
14        first occurrence.  The second occurrence when
15        he had an acute attack and he almost died, he
16        was in the hospital for months, according to
17        Liz.  That's when they took out his lower
18        colon, that's when he had the colostomy bag.
19             And what did Liz say and what did Tracy
20        say?  Liz -- I don't know if Tracy was there.
21        What Liz said is, even in the VA Hospital, when
22        he was so sick he almost died, he was sitting
23        there smoking away or lying there smoking away.
24        Clearly, he met that standard.
25             So let's go -- let's tally this score.

 1        All right.  So if you want to give him
 2        everything, how soon did he wake up?  Within
 3        five minutes, three points.  Difficult to
 4        refrain, one point.  Which cigarette would you
 5        hate to give up?  We don't know.  I bet if you
 6        ask Charlie, it would be that, we'll give him
 7        that.  How many cigarettes?  31 or more a day.
 8        Do you smoke more frequently during the first
 9        hours?  You bet.  Did you smoke when you're
10        sick?  He smoked when he was so sick he was
11        almost dead.
12             And so what does the score -- what does
13        the Fagerstrom score tell us?  Over seven.
14        Your level of dependence is high.  You are not
15        in control of your smoking, it, your smoking,
16        is in control of you.
17             Okay.  We didn't invent this for this
18        lawsuit.  That's what's used by nicotine
19        addiction specialists over the world, and as
20        you heard Dr. Benowitz, addiction involves a
21        loss of control. 22             All right.  So what is it?  As
23        Dr. Benowitz said, a chronic relapsing disease.
24        Dr. Cummings told us 80 percent of current
25        smokers would not start again.  Whoa, that's

 1        customer satisfaction, 80 percent would not
 2        start again.  80 to 90 percent want to quit.
 3        96 percent have tried to quit.
 4             And so why are smokers still smoking?
 5        Because they're addicted, because it's tough,
 6        because it hurts, because it's miserable to
 7        quit, because for some smokers, it's the
 8        hardest thing they ever did, and for some
 9        smokers, even those who are in the hospital,
10        dying, as Dr. Benowitz said, from heart disease
11        or lung cancer, they're still smoking, maybe
12        through a trach, they're still smoking because
13        they can't quit.  That's not everybody, but
14        that's how insidious this addiction is.
15             What are the relapse rates, because
16        quitting is only half the story.  95 percent of
17        people relapse as they're on their road to
18        trying to quit, and the average quit attempts,
19        we talked about, it's five.
20             So what does tobacco claim about all this?
21        Well, they presented no evidence, not one
22        smidgen.  They called no witnesses, not one
23        witness.  But they say this:  Look, this was
24        just a choice.  He wasn't motivated.  He was
25        only motivated when he finally quit.  They

 1        didn't throw out the ashtrays.  He didn't seek
 2        hypnosis.  He didn't go to see a shrink.
 3             Well, when Charlie was quitting, trying to
 4        quit, they didn't have the patch, they didn't
 5        have Chantix, they didn't have anything except
 6        Nicorette gum by prescription, and what Charlie
 7        did is he used toothpicks, all along, really,
 8        toothpicks and straws and he finally was able
 9        to quit it.
10             Okay.  They say, hey, look, Charlie
11        Piendle was a Marine, he was strong-willed.
12        And I asked Dr. Benowitz that question, do
13        strong-willed people get addicted?  Do Marines
14        get addicted?  Do people who read newspapers
15        get addicted?  Of course.  Of course.  Or he
16        could have quit earlier, he could have quit --
17        you know, he quit.  See, they turned it on its
18        head.  He quit, so he could have quit earlier.
19        That's what's known as circular reasoning,
20        isn't it?  He quit, therefore, he could have
21        quit at any time.  Great argument.
22             People, according to Dr. Burns and
23        Dr. Cummings and Dr. Benowitz, do not just
24        choose to die.  They smoke because they're
25        addicted.  No one just chooses to die.  No one

 1        is motivated to die.  They smoke because they
 2        have to or until they're able to quit.
 3             Okay.  So we have a jury verdict form
 4        that's been sitting there all by itself and
 5        there are some questions that we have to answer
 6        and we're going to go through this.  So the  7        first thing, I'm going to combine them, were
 8        tobacco's defective and dangerous cigarettes a
 9        cause of death?  And did the defendants conceal
10        facts about heath and addiction?  I'll put them
11        together so it will make it easier.
12             Okay.  Let's go to the findings by the
13        court.  If you could show those.  These are the
14        instructions of finding, they're actually over
15        here behind me, which I'm sure nobody can see.
16        The first one is smoking causes lung cancer.
17        We can't go behind those findings, those are
18        the findings from the Florida Supreme Court in
19        the Engle case.
20             Nicotine is addictive, is the second
21        finding.
22             The defendants, RJR and Philip Morris
23        placed cigarettes on the market that were
24        defective and unreasonably dangerous, that they
25        concealed or omitted material information not

 1        otherwise known or available, knowing that the
 2        material was false or misleading and they -- or
 3        they failed to disclose a material fact
 4        concerning the health effect of -- or the
 5        addictive nature of smoking.
 6             And then, finally, this is really where
 7        all the meat is, but we're going to see this,
 8        they agreed to conceal or omit information
 9        regarding the health effects of cigarettes.
10        They agreed to conceal with others with the
11        intent that smokers and the public would rely
12        on this information to their detriment.  And
13        then they talk about the companies that were
14        involved and they also include the Tobacco
15        Institute, which we're going to see and you've
16        heard about, and Council for Tobacco Research
17        and so on.
18             So those are findings, we can't go behind
19        them.  So we can only look to see what did
20        Philip Morris and RJR know and what did they do
21        with that knowledge.  What did they know?  When
22        did they know it?  And what did they do with
23        that knowledge?
24             Okay.  Let's start in the beginning, 1953,
25        the Claude Teague memo.  1953, a research

 1        scientist at R.J. Reynolds does this, he
 2        studies all of the cancer studies, that is, he
 3        does a review of all the cancer articles around
 4        the world, and this is what he comes up with,
 5        you know, and this is given to the executives,
 6        to the top brass.  He doesn't just leave it on
 7        his desk.
 8             What does he show?  Studies of clinical
 9        data tend to confirm the relationship between
10        heavy and prolonged tobacco use, tobacco
11        smoking, and incidence of cancer of the lung.
12             And what did these articles and the
13        bibliographies say, cancer, cancer, cancer,
14        tumor, tumor, tumor, cancer, cancer, cancer.
15        This wasn't public knowledge at this time, this
16        was knowledge that they had.  But very soon,
17        there was a cancer scare.  And we heard about 18        this, there were a number of studies, but the
19        one that really captured the public's attention
20        was when a doctor did a study, painted
21        cigarette tar on the backs of mice and they
22        grew tumors.  It was a mouse study and that got
23        a lot of publicity.  TV was new, but it was on
24        TV, it was in newspapers.
25             And what do we know?  Cigarette sales

 1        began to fall, they plummeted, really.
 2             If we can go to the next one.  Maybe we're
 3        having some technical difficulties.
 4             But what happened was, sales began to
 5        fall, and that was extremely alarming to the
 6        tobacco industry, because the last time they
 7        had sales fall was in the Great Depression.
 8        They didn't fall that much, according to
 9        Dr. Burns, because people needed their
10        cigarettes.  So what they had is an emergency
11        December meeting.
12             Are we up there or no?  Okay.
13             So what happened, they had a series of two
14        meetings.  Where?  The Plaza Hotel in New York
15        City.
16             Now, before this, the cigarette companies
17        were fierce competitors, because everybody was
18        trying to market each other, elbow each other
19        out to capture the share of the market, it was
20        an extremely lucrative business.  And what they
21        wanted to do is capture the share of the
22        particular smokers.
23             So this was an extraordinary meeting,
24        extraordinary.  And what did they do, right,
25        they had -- they're armed with the knowledge

 1        that their products caused lung cancer, and so
 2        did they bring their scientists?  Did they
 3        invite world class scientists like the -- back
 4        then, equivalent to Dr. Benowitz or Dr. Burns?
 5        No.  Did they'd bring the Surgeon General, the
 6        doctor to the United States of America?  No.
 7        Did they bring any doctors?  No.  Who did they
 8        bring?  The C.E.O.s, the presidents, and a PR
 9        firm, and a PR firm, best in the business,
10        Hill & Knowlton.
11             All right.  So at this point, Philip
12        Morris and RJR had choices.  They talk about
13        Charlie's choices.  They made choices, and they
14        made a choice, a plan, a strategy that was
15        hatched that would go for 50 years.
16             All right.  So what was their choice?
17        Conceal, cover up, don't link hands with the
18        medical authorities, cover it up, conceal it,
19        never tell the truth, fight every health
20        announcement.  And we saw that happen.  Every
21        Surgeon General's report was attacked.  False,
22        defamatory, it's unproven, it's a controversy.
23        And then when you fight, reassure, reassure
24        your customers, because if you don't, guess
25        what?  People might quit.  They might start

 1        quitting and they might, even worse, not take
 2        it up in the first place.  That would be a  3        catastrophe.  Of course, the millions of people
 4        getting lung cancer and emphysema, well, that
 5        wasn't the primary concern.
 6             So we have some memos of these meetings,
 7        if we could.
 8             This -- this is a -- really, this is a
 9        unique document.  This is the Hill & Knowlton,
10        the PR firm's rendition of what happened,
11        because they went and talked to people from the
12        tobacco industry.  So the author says, the PR
13        guy, the adman says, you'll get little real
14        information about lung cancer, but you'll get
15        some mighty interesting opinions.  One of the
16        men said, it's fortunate for us that cigarettes
17        are a habit they can't break.  Whoopee for us.
18        They're hooked, they're addicted.  Said
19        another, boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our
20        company was the first to produce a cancer-free
21        cigarette for health reasons?  No.  What we
22        could do to the competition, how much more
23        money.  But there's more here.
24             Wouldn't it be wonderful if we were the
25        first to produce a cancer-free cigarette?  And

 1        what does that statement say?  Our cigarettes
 2        are not cancer free.  Our cigarettes cause
 3        cancer.  This is back then.  This is not 2010,
 4        this is 1953.  Suppose everybody smoked just
 5        one cigarette less a day, that would be maybe
 6        40 billion a year.  You know what was on their
 7        minds, and it wasn't the health of their
 8        customers, it wasn't the health of the American
 9        public.
10             So what did they do?  This resulted in
11        what's called the Frank Statement, and there
12        was nothing frank about it.  You've seen this
13        from the evidence.  This Frank Statement was a
14        pure public relations endeavor that was part of
15        this 50-year plan.
16             Okay.  So there's only one problem, they
17        say.  So what's the problem?  Health, our
18        customers may be dying?  No.  It's confidence.
19        Public assurance.  How do we assure the public,
20        not how do we protect the public, how do we
21        assure them, how to free millions of Americans
22        from the guilty fear that's going to arise deep
23        in their biological depths, regardless of any
24        pooh-poohing logic, every time they light a
25        cigarette.  How do we make them feel better?

 1        How do we relieve them of the fear?  That's the
 2        question.  That was their challenge.
 3             So they issued the Frank Statement, okay.
 4        And here is the Frank Statement and this --
 5        remember the Frank Statement, it was published
 6        in 248 of the leading newspapers in the country
 7        and it hit almost everybody in the country.
 8        What did it say?  Medical research indicates
 9        many possible causes of lung cancer.  Conceal,
10        cover up.
11             There is no proof that cigarette smoking
12        is one of those causes, and they did that.
13        They knew there was proof, they knew what 14        caused it, they're talking to the admen.
15             We believe the products we make are not
16        injurious to health, they don't hurt anybody.
17        Never tell the truth.
18             We always have and always will cooperate
19        closely with those whose task it is to
20        safeguard the public health.  That was a lie
21        too.  They never did, not once.
22             All right.  So their plan -- go if you
23        could to their plan, and what was the plan?
24        Make it easy to start smoking.  Make it as hard
25        as possible to stop.  Make it as easy as

 1        possible to start up again.  Easy to start,
 2        hard to quit, and easy as possible to start up
 3        again, and all the reasons that they did that.
 4             Okay.  So that brings us to some of the
 5        new documents, and the first one is from RJR, I
 6        believe, the most important type of story, this
 7        is when they're setting the plan how to tell
 8        the story, the most important type of story is
 9        that which casts doubt, casts doubt on the
10        cause and effect theory of disease and smoking.
11        So they're formulating their plan, what we want
12        are how to cast doubt on the science.
13             Our basic position, they say, in the
14        cigarette controversy is subject to the charge
15        and may be subject to a finding that we are
16        making false and misleading statements to
17        promote the sale of cigarettes.  They're right.
18        They're right.
19             Now, this was not intended for public
20        consumption.  This was The Tobacco Institute
21        and all the companies, and there were C.E.O.s
22        or the vice president or whatever, on this
23        Tobacco Institute, they rotated chairmanship.
24        And what are they saying?  Look, our position
25        is such that we may be subject to a finding

 1        that we're making false statements, that we're
 2        making misleading statements to the public, to
 3        the Surgeon General, to our customers, don't
 4        take it from me, take it from them.
 5             THE CLERK:  Counsel.
 6             MR. BARNHART:  Thank you.
 7             So what happens is did they know, of
 8        course, that cigarettes were dangerous?  This
 9        is shortly before they sent things on.  Yes,
10        they knew.  They're talking about carcinogens,
11        carcinogens clearly cause cancer.
12             We can skip over that for the lack of
13        time.
14             The physiological requirements of the
15        smoker could be met by the application of the
16        optimum amount of nicotine to be extracted,
17        expanded tobacco.
18             What does that mean?  It means that they
19        meet the needs of the addicted smoker by
20        adjusting the amount of nicotine.  You put it
21        in, you take it out.  You put it in, you take
22        it out.  You keep the smoker addicted, take
23        away his choice, make it terribly difficult to
24        stop. 25             Okay.  So what did tobacco know and what

 1        did they -- what did they conceal?  They knew,
 2        in fact, that tobacco causes cancer.
 3             Oh, we're still going.
 4             Okay.  This is important.
 5             During the past two decades, they say,
 6        1962, RJR, cigarette smoke has been the target
 7        of a bunch of studies relating to ill health.
 8        The majority of these studies incriminate
 9        cigarette smoke from a health viewpoint.
10             Well, that's not a surprise, but this is
11        back in the '60s.  Obviously, the amount of
12        evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoke
13        as a health hazard is overwhelming.  The
14        evidence challenging this indictment is scant.
15             Put this in time.  This is about -- this
16        is 1962, late 1962.  What came out in late
17        1964?  The landmark Surgeon General's report.
18        So what they're talking about -- they knew that
19        scientists were working on, and so what they're
20        doing is they're anticipating the Surgeon
21        General's report and, of course, we know that
22        they denied any link, but what's happening is
23        they're saying the evidence to indict cigarette
24        smoke is overwhelming, the evidence challenging
25        this is scant.  That's what they knew before

 1        the Surgeon General's report came out.
 2             Okay.  Then we have two things.  This is,
 3        again, close and prior to the Surgeon General's
 4        report.  Let's go through that quickly.  This
 5        is a talk about carcinogen.
 6             What is a carcinogen?  According to
 7        tobacco, it's a substance which applied to the
 8        tissue of a test animal causes a tumor.  And we
 9        have to assume that if a tumor is caused in an
10        animal, it's caused in a human.  You have to --
11        that's their definition.  Carcinogens are found
12        in practically every class of compounds in
13        smoke.
14             And what's the next document?
15             Carcinogens are found in practically every
16        class of compound in smoke.  And present
17        technology does not permit selective filtration
18        of particulate smoke.  We can't filter out any
19        of this stuff, they know that.
20             So this is just before the Surgeon
21        General's report.  And then they send a letter
22        to the Surgeon General, because they knew the
23        report was coming out, 1963.  Right after we
24        just saw their internal document that says
25        that, what did they tell the Surgeon General?

 1        None of the chemical substances listed, to our
 2        knowledge, has been found by scientific
 3        research to be harmful to the health of the
 4        smoker in amounts reported in smoke.
 5             What did they -- what did they know?  It
 6        was carcinogen, it caused cancer, the evidence
 7        was overwhelming, the evidence against was
 8        scant, and what did they officially say to the
 9        Surgeon General?  It's not there.  It's not 10        there.  They lied to the Surgeon General.  They
11        didn't just mislead, that was deceit, but it
12        was deceit with a motive.
13             Okay.  So then we go on.  We know the
14        Surgeon General's report did find a link to
15        cancer, and that made big news.  So then we
16        come down to 1972 to talk about addiction,
17        because they always denied it was addictive,
18        it's just a habit, just a habit.
19             Okay.  So what is going on behind the
20        scenes at RJR in this case?  Happily for the
21        tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating
22        and unique.  If nicotine is a sine qua non, the
23        end all, be all of tobacco products, and
24        tobacco products are recognized as being
25        attracted dosage forms of nicotine -- sounds

 1        like a doctor, doesn't it?  Write a
 2        prescription, what are we doing?  We're making
 3        dosage -- dosage machines is what we're doing.
 4        We're giving our smokers doses of nicotine.  We
 5        have -- and this follows back the plot.  We
 6        have deliberately played down the role of
 7        nicotine.
 8             Now, look, defense counsel is going to get
 9        up here and say, hey, everybody knew nicotine
10        was habit forming.  They talked about nicotine
11        fiend, cigarette fiends, we had this and we had
12        that.  Look what tobacco said in the privacy of
13        their own boardrooms, we have deliberately, not
14        accidently, not negligently, not inadvertently,
15        we have deliberately played down the role of
16        nicotine.  We somehow must convince him, the
17        smoker, with wholly irrational reasons that he
18        should try smoking, in the hope that he will
19        himself then discover the real satisfactions.
20        Those are not my italics or quotes.  You know
21        what they are?  Theirs.  Because you know what
22        real satisfactions are?  Nicotine addiction.
23             All right.  Let's go to the next one.
24             So get them to rely, get the people to
25        rely, downplay the addiction.  All right.  So

 1        then we come up to what they know.  All right.
 2        Our next one is an RJR memo and this one says,
 3        we -- they're worried about their business,
 4        right, so we can't ever be comfortable selling
 5        a product which most of our customers would
 6        stop using if they could.  Again, they knew it
 7        was addictive.  That's to say, hey, we would
 8        lose our business, we'd go out of business
 9        overnight.  We can't be comfortable marketing a
10        product which most of our customers would do
11        without if they could.  Most of our customers
12        would do without if they could, but they can't,
13        and we deliberately downplayed the role of
14        addiction.
15             All right.  So was their plan successful?
16        Their plan was amazingly successful.  You have
17        got to hand it to them, if you're going to
18        hatch a plot, if you're going to conceal, if
19        you're going to mislead, they did a terrific
20        job of it. 21             How do we know?  Well, they say so
22        themselves.  This industry has employed a
23        single strategy, and you've seen it, cover up,
24        while the strategy was brilliantly conceived
25        and brilliantly executed, over the years, it's

 1        just a holding strategy, right?
 2             So, you know, again, this is not a
 3        footprint in the sand.  This is a confession.
 4        It's brilliantly conceived, it's brilliantly
 5        executed.  Who says so?  We do.  Because we did
 6        it.  What's our strategy?  Create doubt.  Don't
 7        take my word for it, take theirs.  Creating
 8        doubt about the health charge, without actually
 9        denying it.  Advocate the public's right to
10        smoke without actually urging them to take it
11        up.  Oh, it was a good plan, it was a good
12        plan, and it provided reassurance to these
13        addicted smokers over the years and their
14        business went up and up and up.
15             Okay.  That brings us to the next
16        document, and now this talks about The Tobacco
17        Institute's successful defensive operation, and
18        then they talk -- because people hadn't --
19             Are we here?  Okay.  I'm going to have to
20        go through these more quickly.
21             Look, if this committee had not been
22        formed, that is their plan, the cigarette
23        industry, by now, would be in a deplorable
24        portion.  You know why?  Because if word had
25        gotten out, they would be in the position

 1        people are in now, people still smoke, but it's
 2        at a far less rate.  What would have happened
 3        is people would have tried to quit and many
 4        would have been successful and many more,
 5        millions more would never have started.
 6             Okay.  So we'd be in a deplorable
 7        position, instead a very fine job has been
 8        counteracting unverified, unjustified, and
 9        unsubstantiated claims.  It's been a successful
10        defensive operation.
11             Go to the next one.
12             The TIRC, so what do we have here?  Let's
13        look at this.  Nicotine is addictive.  We're in
14        the business of selling nicotine, 1963, right
15        before the Surgeon General's report.  An
16        addictive drug, but guess what?  Cigarettes,
17        nicotine have some unattractive side effects.
18        Gee, that's too bad.  What are they?  They
19        cause or predispose people to lung cancer.
20        Well, that's a bad side effect.  They
21        contribute to cardiovascular disorders and they
22        may call emphysema and so on.
23             Next one.
24             Okay.  So what was the TIRC?  Philip
25        Morris, happens to be one of their documents.

 1        We must, in the near future, provide some
 2        answers which will give smokers a psychological
 3        crutch and self-denial -- I mean,
 4        self-rationale.
 5             That's one of the most important documents  6        here.  Why?  Because that's the reliance, get
 7        people to rely, give smokers a psychological
 8        crutch and a self-rationale to continue.
 9        Excuse me.  Get them to doubt.  Get them to
10        rely.  That's it.  That's the plan.  That's the
11        bottom line, make more money, sell more
12        cigarettes, hook more people.
13             Then they had a new public relations firm,
14        and this one is, if we could, this is Tiderock
15        Corporation.  And their proposal, which was
16        accepted, reestablished the cigarette
17        controversy.
18             And what's the controversy?  It's
19        unproven, we don't know, it's not addictive,
20        it's a choice, but it's going to cost us a lot
21        of money.  Back in that day, 1967, 50 million a
22        year.  It's chicken feed now.
23             Okay.  Did they mislead the public?  They
24        attacked the Surgeon General in 1972.  They
25        attacked the Surgeon General in 1964.  They

 1        attacked the Surgeon General again and again
 2        and again.  Let's go very quickly through these
 3        if we could.
 4             Look what they say about the '72 Surgeon
 5        General's report.  It insults the scientific
 6        community.  And we know from their documents
 7        that we just saw that they agreed with what the
 8        Surgeon General said.  They knew the Surgeon
 9        General was telling the truth.  Insults the
10        scientific community.
11             The number one health problem is not
12        cigarette smoking.  No, it's not.  It's the
13        extent to which public health officials, the
14        Surgeon General, is knowingly misleading the
15        American public.  That lying Surgeon General,
16        he's misleading the public, that's the danger,
17        not cigarettes.  And we know they knew the
18        Surgeon General was right.
19             Next one.
20             Okay.  More continuing controversy.
21        Scientists are becoming concerned that the
22        preoccupation with smoking -- no scientists
23        were, none of them, except paid for by grants
24        from tobacco.  Those were the scientists.
25        Becoming concerned with the preoccupation that

 1        smoking may become -- may be both unfounded and
 2        dangerous.
 3             And here's why.  Here's what they say.
 4        It's dangerous because it diverts attention
 5        from other hazards.  Focusing on tobacco is
 6        dangerous.  It's dangerous.  And they knew that
 7        was wrong, they knew it was deceit, they knew
 8        it was misleading, and they knew that people
 9        would get the message.  They would -- smokers
10        particularly, they would rely on it.
11             It's time for the parties to admit that
12        there is much that is unknown.  There wasn't
13        anything unknown.  You heard Dr. Burns, there
14        was unanimity in the scientific community.  No
15        one knows now a cancerous growth begins.  Sure,
16        they did.  They don't know exactly how, but 17        they knew that cigarette smoking caused cancer.
18        Of course they did.
19             Okay.  Let's keep going.  1984.  1984, you
20        may assume the case against smoking is closed,
21        but this is far from the truth.  Advertising.
22        Get our smokers to rely, get Charlie Piendle to
23        rely, because you know it's tough to quit.
24        They may be right, it may be something else.
25        Maybe I don't have to quit, maybe I don't.

 1        Give me a crutch, give me a psychological
 2        crutch.  Give me a reason, a self-rationale why
 3        I don't have to go through withdrawal.  Because
 4        we think reasonable people who analyze this see
 5        this not as a closed case, but as an open
 6        controversy.
 7             And where did that language come from?
 8        The PR people.  We saw that.  An open
 9        controversy, with who?  Cigarette manufacturers
10        and their customers, that's who.  We don't say
11        there are no questions, there's just a lot of
12        questions.
13             Next one, please.
14             Okay.  So then we come to Dr. Benowitz,
15        who is the author of the 1988 Surgeon General's
16        report, the one that linked addiction with
17        other drugs, addiction to nicotine with other
18        drugs.
19             And what did they say about that?  We know
20        from their documents we just saw.  They know
21        that they were giving doses of nicotine, that
22        it was addictive.  We know that.  They knew it
23        a decade, two decades ago.
24             And what are they saying?  The claim by
25        the Surgeon General, Dr. Benowitz, Dr. Burns,

 1        Dr. Cummings, the claim that cigarette smoking
 2        is a drug addiction similar to cocaine, heroin
 3        or alcohol is irresponsible.  Defame, attack
 4        the Surgeon General, attack the medical
 5        establishment, attack medicine, attack science.
 6             The message to the American public, and in
 7        particular, American youth, that using illegal
 8        drugs like crack and heroin has the same risk
 9        of addiction as smoking.  To convey this
10        message is to invite disaster, disaster, and
11        trivialize a serious drug problem.
12             I mean, you know, that's the point.
13        They're good at that stuff.  They were very
14        good at that stuff.  And millions and millions
15        of people and millions and millions of Charlie
16        Piendles relied on this.  Because, hey, it was
17        up in the air, there was a controversy.
18             Okay.  Let's go to the next one if we
19        could.
20             So what do they say about this 1968
21        report?  The Surgeon General's report is
22        shocking.  It's a shockingly intemperate
23        defamation of an industry, a blue-blooded
24        American industry.  They defamed us, saying
25        that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.

 1             Let's go to the next one if we could.  2             So then we go all the way to 1994, a year
 3        before Charlie Piendle is diagnosed with what's
 4        going to kill him, his lung cancer.  This is in
 5        front of Congress.  They have sworn to tell the
 6        truth, just like you swore your oaths as jurors
 7        and just like every witness swore to tell the
 8        truth in this courtroom.
 9             And what do they say?
10             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
11        transcribed as follows:)
12             CONGRESSMAN WYDEN:  Let me begin my
13        questioning on the matter of whether or not
14        nicotine is addictive.  Let me ask you first,
15        and I'd like to just go down the row, whether
16        each of you believes that nicotine is not
17        addictive.  I heard virtually all of you touch
18        on it.  Just yes or no.  Do you believe
19        nicotine is not addictive?
20             VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not
21        addictive, yes.
22             CONGRESSMAN WYDEN:  Mr. Johnston?
23             MR. JOHNSTON:  Congressman, cigarettes and
24        nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
25        definitions of addiction.  There is no

 1        intoxicants --
 2             CONGRESSMAN WYDEN:  We'll take that as a
 3        no.  And, again, time is short.  If you could
 4        just -- I think each of you believe nicotine is
 5        not addictive, and we'd just like to have this
 6        for the record.
 7             VOICE:  I don't believe that nicotine or
 8        our products are addictive.
 9             VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not
10        addictive.
11             VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not
12        addictive.
13             VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not
14        addictive.
15             VOICE:  And I, too, believe that nicotine
16        is not addictive.
17             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)
18             MR. BARNHART:  That's a lie, it's a lie,
19        it's a lie, it's a lie, and they knew it was a
20        lie.  And they lied under oath to Congress and
21        they lied under oath to the American people.
22             And what did they say about cancer?
23             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
24        transcribed as follows:)
25             NARRATOR:  Mr. Campbell --

 1             MR. BARNHART:  1994.
 2             NARRATOR:  -- you were also deposed and
 3        you said, quote, to my knowledge, it has not
 4        been proven that cigarette smoking causes
 5        cancer.  This is a rather passive and pleasant
 6        approach, especially in light of the consensus,
 7        not by some, but all of the scientific
 8        community.  Will you ever be convinced and what
 9        evidence are you waiting for?
10             And let's have the microphone passed over.
11             MR. CAMPBELL:  Yes, I may be convinced.
12        We don't know what causes cancer in general 13        right now.  So I think that we may find out
14        what causes cancer and we may find out some
15        relationship, which has yet to be proven.
16             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)
17             MR. BARNHART:  That's from the 1950s, stay
18        on the message, keep to the plan, follow the
19        game plan, keep the strategy, convince,
20        confuse, provide a psychological crutch,
21        provide a reason for self-rationale.
22             Okay.  Another deception, and then we'll
23        start going through the jury verdict form, is
24        the illusion of filtration.  Not my word, their
25        word.

 1             Now, remember, filters came up in response
 2        to the 1953 cancer scare.
 3             If you could show us the sales.
 4             This is the illusion of filtration.  It
 5        comes from their documents.  The illusion of
 6        filtration is as important as the fact of
 7        filtration.
 8             Why?  Remember the ads, clean, ivory
 9        white.  The illusion of filtration is that
10        people were smoking something safer, and people
11        relied on that by the millions.  The illusion
12        of filtration is as important, their words, as
13        the fact -- as the fact.
14             The primary reason stated for smoking or
15        being interested in smoking filter tips are
16        reasons of health.  This is their research on
17        what smokers thought.  Why did smokers go to
18        smoking filter tips?  For reasons of health.
19        They thought it was healthy.  And did tobacco,
20        and tobacco knew early on, knew that filters
21        did nothing.  Why?  Why?  Because the smokers
22        customize their use and because filters don't
23        take out anything that the smoker can't
24        overcome.
25             All right.  Let's go to next one if we

 1        could.
 2             Okay.  So what does this say?  This talks
 3        about what they were proposing to do.  "I have
 4        observed and generally believe" -- this is
 5        1953, during the cancer scare -- "that the
 6        cigarette-smoking public attaches great
 7        significance to the visual examination of the
 8        filter material in filter-tip cigarettes."
 9             This is Claude Teague, this is their
10        research scientist.  It is proposed that
11        filter-tip material such as cotton and this and
12        that be treated so that it turns color.  Right?
13        They actually -- it turns out they didn't adopt
14        this.  But what are they looking at?  They know
15        that filters don't work, they want to give the
16        illusion of filtration so people think it's
17        safer.
18             Go to the next one.
19             And we know all too often that a smoker
20        who switches to a hi-fi, high-filter cigarette
21        winds up smoking more units.  Remember what
22        Dr. Burns said?  Remember what Dr. Cummings
23        said?  This is 1961, early 1961.  All too often 24        a smoker who switches to a high-filter
25        cigarette winds up smoking more units,

 1        scientific precision, in order to provide
 2        himself with the same delivery which he had
 3        before.  They titrate, the smoker does,
 4        unconsciously, subconsciously, to get the
 5        nicotine and the tar that they need.  They suck
 6        it in, they smoke more, they inhale more
 7        deeply, they smoke more cigarettes, they puff
 8        more often.  In short, I don't believe the
 9        smoking pattern has changed much, even with the
10        cancer scares and filtered cigarettes.  1961.
11             Next one, please.
12             Okay.  So what happens is Dr. Burns says,
13        right after that, sales went right back up.
14        Introduction of filters before the 1950s, less
15        than 1 percent of the cigarettes sold in the
16        United States were filtered.  After that, sales
17        zoomed.
18             Are you with me?  Okay.  All right.
19             So what happens is smokers compensate, as
20        they say.  They customize their use, they smoke
21        more.  The industry knew this.  And, you know,
22        it's interesting, what Dr. Burns said is the
23        medical community denied, and this is one area
24        where it said, unfortunately, the medical
25        community did not, and why?  Because the

 1        cigarette smoker, the cigarette research
 2        departments used real people.  They watched
 3        smokers.  The medical community used smoking
 4        machines, so they just measured a draw through
 5        a filter.  And they thought the filters
 6        actually helped.  So the scientific community
 7        actually helped that out.  And they didn't find
 8        out about it until they did the research that
 9        tobacco did and used real smokers and found out
10        that people compensate, that they suck in more,
11        that they inhale more deeply.
12             Filters deceived people for 60 years and
13        are still deceiving smokers.  You heard their
14        expert, tobacco's -- well, he's an employee,
15        the nonmedical doctor, Dr. Figlar, and he said
16        every product that Charlie Piendle smoked from
17        the time he started until the time he quit was
18        equally hazardous to his health.  All their
19        changes have not done a doggone thing to make
20        cigarettes less hazardous.  They are still
21        hazardous, they still kill, and all these
22        filters do is provide an illusion of safety.
23             Okay.  So did they cause people to rely?
24        Of course, they did.  They spent billions of
25        dollars, and you can advertise, but you can't

 1        mislead people, you cannot deceive people.
 2        It's okay to advertise, but you can't lie to
 3        them.
 4             What do they say?  It's safe, it's
 5        unproven, it's filtered.  You can quit.  It's a
 6        choice.  It's just a choice.  And that's what
 7        smokers want to hear.  Nonsmokers are different
 8        things.  Remember Dr. Cummings told us about  9        that?
10             But smokers get reassurance, and that's,
11        remember, going back to their documents, we
12        want to reassure them deep in their biological
13        depths, we want to pooh-pooh any fears they
14        have.  1953.  Reassure them, provide the
15        rationale, give them a reason to rely to keep
16        smoking, to start smoking, because otherwise we
17        won't sell enough.
18             So why did tobacco do this?  Well, you-all
19        didn't fall off the turnip truck.  They did it
20        to make money.  And there's nothing wrong with
21        making money, that's the American way.  What is
22        wrong about making money is if you make money
23        deceitfully, if you lie, if you conceal, and if
24        you kill people, and you know you're doing it,
25        and you attack the Surgeon General, who is

 1        trying to protect people, and you attack the
 2        medical establishment, that's not right, and
 3        that is why you're here.
 4             They deceived their customers for money,
 5        they killed people for money.  They didn't go
 6        out and shoot them, but they knew they were
 7        killing people.  They put profits over safety.
 8        They put business ahead of the health of
 9        mothers and fathers and girls and boys and
10        grandmothers and grandfathers and aunts and
11        uncles and everybody who smoked.
12             So did this coverup make a difference to
13        Charlie Piendle?  The defense will say, hey, we
14        never heard Charlie Piendle say, "I want to sue
15        somebody."  Look, if it didn't matter to
16        Charlie Piendle, it didn't matter to America.
17        It didn't matter to anyone.
18             Why?  Charlie smoked the most advertised
19        brands of his time, the most -- the most
20        popular ones, Lucky Strikes.  They tried
21        Camels, but you heard Babe, they didn't like
22        them, they were too strong.  Marlboro, Winston.
23        He followed the typical prototype of kids his
24        age.  He smoked what they smoked.
25             Did he rely on it?  You better believe it.

 1        There was a billboard across the street, the
 2        Marlboro Man, right there across the street
 3        from where they bought cigarettes.  Babe says,
 4        "We all wanted to be the Marlboro Man."  Indeed
 5        they did, indeed they did.
 6             They targeted kids, they targeted
 7        teenagers.  That was their market.  You're
 8        going to see a bunch of documents in just a
 9        minute.  It was cool, it was sexy, it was
10        sophisticated, it was the thing to do.  That
11        was their market.  You saw those letters to the
12        teachers, the principals, actually the
13        students.  They made it hard to quit.  They
14        made it hard -- they made it easy to start
15        again.
16             You know what Dr. Burns said, they studied
17        it, they studied it.  And subconscious reliance
18        is still reliance, give them a psychological
19        crutch, let them -- let them deny, give them 20        reassurance.  That's what they did.  Of course
21        Charlie relied on it.
22             Okay.  So what's tobacco's excuse?  He
23        never said he wanted to sue anybody.  I mean,
24        can you imagine this conversation?  "Well,
25        honey, how are you doing?"

 1             "Well, you know, I feel like suing tobacco
 2        today."
 3             That just didn't happen, and why?  He
 4        never knew what they knew.  All of the
 5        documents that you now know about didn't even
 6        surface until the Engle case and other cases
 7        came forward.  He didn't know what they knew
 8        about cancer.  He didn't know what they knew
 9        about addiction.
10             And their plan, the plan they hatched and
11        carried out for 50 years, lasted all the way
12        through Charlie Piendle's life.  He died before
13        it was uncovered.  It took courts, it took
14        lawsuits to get these documents out.  I mean,
15        these documents were not produced voluntarily
16        by tobacco.  They came out of the Surgeon --
17        out of attorney's general suing, out of
18        lawsuits, out of judges telling them, you got
19        to produce your documents.
20             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.  That's
21        way beyond the scope of any evidence in this
22        case.
23             THE COURT:  I'll sustain.
24             MR. BARNHART:  Not at all.  Dr. Cummings
25        testified about it.

 1             THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.
 2             MR. BARNHART:  Then they say, hey,
 3        everybody knew.  Everybody knew smoking was
 4        bad.  Well, everybody -- everybody did not
 5        know.  People who don't smoke, yes, they knew
 6        after a while, after they were addicted.  We
 7        knew Charlie wanted to quit.  We know that 80
 8        to 90 percent of the people wanted to quit, but
 9        by then it's too late.
10             And then they say, "Hey, Charlie should
11        have known what we knew.  Charlie should have
12        known what we covered up."  I think you'll find
13        the evidence is just -- that can't be.
14             Okay.  So what did they do?  They called
15        an economist from Las Vegas to testify about
16        polling, go figure.  And what did she admit,
17        hey, there's a big difference between belief
18        and awareness in polls.  99.9 percent of the
19        people are aware of UFOs, but a small fraction
20        believe in them.  There's a huge difference in
21        misreading a poll.
22             In 1954, one of the polls she showed,
23        50 -- there were no kids.  Remember, Charlie
24        was a kid.  He just started smoking.  58
25        percent of the adults either did not believe

 1        that smoking caused lung cancer or didn't know.
 2             She ignored the conclusions of the Surgeon
 3        General's reports.  That's a common thread,
 4        isn't it?  Ignore the Surgeon General's  5        reports.
 6             She said under cross-examination, you
 7        know, smokers do respond differently to poll
 8        questions.  Smokers tend not to believe.  Why?
 9        Reliance, psychological crutch, self-denial.
10             THE CLERK:  Counselor, 30 minutes.
11             MR. BARNHART:  Thank you.
12             She relied on these Ogg studies, but she
13        disagreed with the conclusions.  She relied on
14        a study paid by RJR lawyers, the Jones Day
15        firm.  I'm not talking about these lawyers over
16        here, but a national law firm that underwrote
17        one of their studies.  And she admitted that
18        teens don't understand the risks and they
19        regret smoking.
20             Then they called a historian, Dr. Norrell.
21        He's been made a millionaire, or almost, by
22        tobacco.  What's his field?  American history,
23        not tobacco.  He never published a doggone
24        thing on tobacco.  His interest was in
25        testifying.

 1             You know what he did, he showed articles
 2        with no connection to Charlie Piendle.
 3        Articles from Hartford, not Bridgeport.
 4        Articles from Jacksonville and Orlando.  The
 5        Reader's Digest.  The Piendles didn't read the
 6        Reader's Digest and a kid didn't read it, he
 7        read Sports Illustrated and National
 8        Geographic.  And he only showed one side, we
 9        saw that when he was being cross-examined.  He
10        ignored industry articles, he ignored industry
11        statements, he ignored the billions of ads, he
12        ignored harmful evidence.
13             And then finally has this business about
14        Charlie's schools, Charlie took a course in
15        health.  And then we saw on his grade card he
16        didn't take a course in health.  Well, then he
17        took it in gym.
18             Lucille, his best friend, said, "I never
19        did that.  I was in the same class as him."
20        Probably not the same gym class, but same
21        class.  "We never took a health course on
22        smoking."  I mean, who are they trying to kid?
23             And then, finally, teens should have known
24        that tobacco was lying.
25             Okay.  So let me work through this very

 1        quickly.  Was Charlie Piendle addicted to
 2        cigarettes?  There's no evidence to the
 3        contrary, yes.
 4             Were the cigarettes placed on the market
 5        by RJR a legal cause of his death?  Yes.
 6             Were the cigarettes placed on the market
 7        by Philip Morris a legal cause of his death?
 8        Yes.
 9             Did he rely to his detriment on omissions,
10        concealment, omissions of material fact, of
11        failure to disclose things?  Did he rely on
12        tobacco's lies and public relations campaign?
13        That's the answer, that's the question.  Yes.
14        The evidence is overwhelming.
15             Did he rely to his detriment on Philip 16        Morris's, their campaign, their strategy, the
17        things they did to get him to rely, the
18        statements they made?  Of course he had, it was
19        his culture.  It was all over.  Drum, drum,
20        drum, beat, beat, beat.  All the smokers did,
21        yes.
22             Now, look, if we have to prove that
23        Charlie Piendle read a particular ad and have
24        Liz remember it from 20 years ago, no smoker
25        could ever win.  But that's not the law, that's

 1        not the law.
 2             Was any act taken in furtherance of an
 3        agreement, the conspiracy?  We saw that, we
 4        just worked through it.  Yes.
 5             And did they do it with an intention that
 6        smokers and the public would rely on this
 7        information?  They spent billions and billions
 8        and billions of dollars.  Of course they wanted
 9        to.  They say no, nobody relied on it.  Why
10        then spend billions and billions and billions
11        of dollars on a worthless task?  Because you
12        know what, they are not dumb business people.
13        They don't do worthless things in terms of
14        spending their dollars.  Of course they did.
15        Yes.
16             Were they negligent?  You've already seen
17        that.
18             And then was negligence a legal cause of
19        Charlie's death?  I submit to you the answer is
20        yes.
21             All right.  So we're up to speed, and I'm
22        going to jump over these things and rely on
23        your memory.
24             We come to Dr. Figlar.  Dr. Figlar was --
25        I believe he's a chemist, and here's what he

 1        said.  Dr. Figlar.  They had the capacity to
 2        reduce tar and cigarettes and they did not.
 3        They sold some cigarettes with 19 times the tar
 4        that was the cancer-causing agent than others,
 5        and all the cigarettes that Charlie smoked were
 6        hazardous, every single one, despite all this
 7        filtration and this and that, poking holes in
 8        the cigarette.
 9             That brings us to percentages of fault.
10        And what is the percentage of fault?  This is
11        this question right here.  You-all will be
12        asked to determine the percentage of fault that
13        will cause Charlie's death.  And we have
14        admitted, Charlie has admitted that Charlie was
15        at fault.  So some percentage is going to go on
16        Charlie.
17             And what does it do?  Let's take a verdict
18        for $100.  If you find Charlie Piendle
19        5 percent or 10 percent at fault, Charlie would
20        get $95 or $90.  That's the effect of that.
21        You're not supposed to make any reductions,
22        Judge Rosenberg does that.
23             So I suggest to you this:  You've got to
24        consider the time he started, the environment
25        created by tobacco, the massive campaign to
6884  1        target teenagers, the immature teenage brain,
 2        the fact that teenagers are more susceptible to
 3        addiction, and the fact that cigarettes back
 4        then had two or three times the amount of
 5        nicotine than they do now.
 6             And what did Dr. Burns or Cummings say?
 7        Teens do not make informed decisions.  So in
 8        terms of fault, that's something to consider
 9        strongly.  Why?  Because they feel immortal,
10        they don't understand addiction, their brain
11        changes.
12             Let's compare doctors in 1964.  Remember
13        the 1964 report, you saw the TV, and we're
14        going to go very quickly through that, because
15        we're running out of time.
16             Compare Charlie -- these are doctors.
17        Charlie had a high school education.
18             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
19        transcribed as follows:)
20             MR. REASONER:  . . . industry's spokesmen
21        and anti-cigarette crusaders alike --
22             MR. BARNHART:  These are the men at the
23        top of their field.
24             MR. REASONER:  -- the committee finally
25        assembled --

 1             MR. BARNHART:  They're like Dr. Benowitz.
 2        They're like Dr. Burns.
 3             MR. REASONER:  -- some 14 months ago.
 4        These men, each an expert in his field --
 5             MR. BARNHART:  The cream of the crop the
 6        best of the best --
 7             MR. REASONER:  -- were brought together
 8        from different parts of the country and from
 9        different fields of science --
10             MR. BARNHART:  -- and they studied it for
11        13, 14, 15 months.
12             MR. REASONER:  -- Dr. Walter Burdette,
13        surgery, University of Utah.  Dr. John B.
14        Hickman, internal medicine, Indiana, nonsmoker.
15        Dr. Emmanuel Farber, pathology, Pittsburgh,
16        nonsmoker.  Dr. Stanhope Bayne-Jones, J.L.
17        School of medicine, nonsmoker.  Dr. Leonard M.
18        Schuman, public health, Minnesota, cigarette
19        smoker.  Dr. Charles LeMaistre, preventative
20        medicine, Texas, pipe smoker.  Professor
21        William G. Cochran, statistics, Harvard,
22        cigarette smoker.  Professor Lewis G. Fieser,
23        chemistry, Harvard, cigarettes and pipe . . .
24             (Thereupon, the video clip was stopped.)
25             MR. BARNHART:  That's enough.

 1             You compare what those learned men knew
 2        who had studied it, and a number of them, I
 3        can't remember what it was, 25, 40 percent of
 4        them, I can't remember, were still smoking when
 5        they announced the '64 Surgeon General's
 6        report.
 7             And compare the journalists we saw,
 8        learned men, men who had reported on this story
 9        since the cancer scare began, men who reported
10        on the 1964 Surgeon General's report.  Edward
11        R. Murrow, dead of lung cancer, an addict. 12        Harry Reasoner, dead of lung cancer, unable to
13        stop.  Peter Jennings, Charlie's age, dead of
14        lung cancer, unable to stop.
15             So when we compare all that -- let's
16        compare Charlie Piendle.  Yes, he was at fault,
17        he shouldn't have started smoking.  I suggest
18        to you that 5 to 10 percent is reasonable.  And
19        for Philip Morris and RJR, you determine that.
20        45, 45, 47, 5, whatever it is, you determine
21        and you fill that in.
22             That brings us to damages.
23             And Judge, this is a good time to take a
24        break.


17                     CLOSING ARGUMENT
18             MS. BAKER-BARNES:  Good morning, ladies
19        and gentlemen.
20             When Greg started this morning some time
21        ago, he told you that you have immense power,
22        and you do, you have a tremendous power in this
23        case to make it right, to make it right for Liz
24        Piendle, and to measure all of the damage and
25        all of the harm that she has suffered and that

 1        she continues to suffer every day, and she
 2        suffered a tremendous harm.  She suffered a
 3        tremendous loss.  She lost a great man.  Greg
 4        said he was a fine man, he was a great man.
 5             He served his country until his body
 6        wouldn't let him anymore and he never
 7        complained, not one complaint.  When his father
 8        died in front of him, right in front of him and
 9        right in front of his brother, he stood up and
10        became the father, he stood up and became the
11        man.  And you heard from Eddie, you heard from
12        his brother Eddie Piendle, he said he was my
13        brother, he was my father, he was my best
14        friend, he was my everything.  And he wasn't
15        everything to just Eddie, he was everything to
16        everybody who ever met him.
17             Babe Cabral, his best friend from grammar
18        school, came in.  He told you Charlie was my
19        best friend 50 years, 50 years, he was my best
20        friend.  You heard from Lucille Worobel, met
21        freshman year in high school, he was my best
22        friend.  Everybody who met this man, everybody
23        whose life he touched, he was my best friend.
24             And for Liz, after all that she has been
25        through, at such a young age her husband is

 1        swept away at sea, she's got a three-month old
 2        baby, and Charlie comes in and he makes it all
 3        better.  He fell in love with her, he made her
 4        smile again, he made her laugh again, and Alan
 5        wasn't her son -- he wasn't my stepson, he was
 6        Charlie's son, Charlie's son.
 7             They read you portions of Alan's
 8        deposition and what did Alan say?  What did you
 9        call Mr. Piendle, what did you call him?  I
10        called him dad.  He was my dad.  And they built
11        a beautiful life together, a life filled with
12        family and friends and love and support,
13        support for Charlie through his many obstacles.
14        We know he had Crohn's disease and there were 15        times when it was so difficult.  Three months
16        in the hospital, he got last rights twice and
17        almost died, and Liz was right there, right
18        there with him every step of the way, for 27
19        years.
20             And yes, they had some bumps and bruises
21        along the way, as we all do, but what did Liz
22        tell you?  It made us stronger, it only made us
23        stronger, it only made us love each other more,
24        it only made that bond so much deeper.
25             And members of the jury, they had a

 1        beautiful life together raising their family
 2        and raising their children and they got to that
 3        stage where it was their time.  And you heard
 4        about the motorcycles and you heard Liz tell
 5        you that when Charlie rode those motorcycles,
 6        he felt free.  She didn't know if he was going
 7        to be able to do it, I didn't know physically
 8        if he would be able to do it, but he did it and
 9        he felt free.  And she told you and Lucille
10        told you it was the best time of his life.  And
11        they had dreams, they had dreams to travel this
12        country together, to travel the world together,
13        to grow old together, and those dreams were
14        shattered when Charlie got lung cancer.  They
15        were shattered and they were cut short, and
16        they were never realized.
17             And who was right there with Charlie every
18        step of the way?  Because he was a fighter.
19        You heard it from both of them, Charlie was a
20        fighter.  He was a Marine, and he fought a
21        valiant battle against cancer, a valiant
22        battle, but it was too much.  It spread
23        everywhere.  It spread from his lungs to his
24        brain.  It took over his body.  It didn't take
25        over his soul, but it took over his body, and

 1        Liz was right there with him every step of the
 2        way.
 3             And there came a time when Charlie and Liz
 4        and everybody realized that the end was near
 5        and they took that last trip to Connecticut.
 6        And you heard about it from Eddie, he threw a
 7        party with hundreds of family and friends and
 8        who was there, Lucille was, Babe was there,
 9        Eddie was there, Liz was there, their whole
10        family was there, to say we love you, Charlie,
11        we want to tell you while you're still here,
12        not after you're gone, we love you.
13             And that plane ride home.  And Liz is the
14        only one that can tell you what happened on
15        that plane, the only one, she's right there,
16        four stops, three stops to get gas to refuel,
17        and every time they stopped, they didn't know
18        if he was going to make it.  I don't know if
19        you're going to make it, Charlie, but hold on
20        for your kids, I want you to make it home to
21        see your kids.  And he did.  He made it because
22        that was Charlie.  He made it.  And what did he
23        say when he got off that plane and Liz was
24        right there, where is my baby girl?  I just
25        want to see my baby girl, and then he was gone. 6901
 1             After 27 years, he was gone.  And family
 2        was there, Liz told you, for a while, and
 3        friends were there for a while, but there comes
 4        a time when everybody is gone.  And that time
 5        came for Liz and she went back home to the
 6        house they built with their hands and they
 7        lived in for 15 years.
 8             And what did she tell you?  It was eerily
 9        quiet, dead quiet, and for the first time since
10        I was 17 years old, I was scared and I was
11        alone and I was afraid, and for 14 years, for
12        14 years, every second, every minute, every
13        hour, every day, every month, every year, she
14        misses Charlie, every day she misses Charlie.
15        She watches her granddaughter growing up
16        without her grandfather and she misses Charlie.
17        They have Christmas holidays and celebrations
18        and she misses Charlie.  She wakes up in the
19        morning and walks out her front door, she
20        misses Charlie.
21             And yes, she's dated.  The defense has
22        brought that to your attention and made it very
23        clear, she's tried, she absolutely has, she's
24        tried to move on, she's tried to continue with
25        her life, but you know what, none of it worked

 1        out, none of it.
 2             Jorge, she told you about Jorge.  They
 3        asked her directly, how long did you date him,
 4        when did you meet him?  She told them
 5        everything they wanted to know about Jorge and
 6        everything they wanted to know about anybody
 7        else that she dated and she told them, but you
 8        know what, she never met another Charlie.
 9        Jorge was a nice man, but he wasn't Charlie.
10        Jerry was a nice man, but he wasn't Charlie.
11        And every day, every day she lived without him.
12             So what is it worth?  What is it worth to
13        live your life, to have 23 years -- and
14        Judge Rosenberg has instructed you that that's
15        the time they had, those were their golden
16        years, those were supposed to be the best time
17        of their lives -- 23 years cut short by the
18        defendants in this case?
19             So what is it worth?  You heard
20        Dr. Norrell come to you and come in here and
21        tell you that he's made over a million dollars
22        to come in here and show you some newspaper
23        clips and magazine articles and TV clips, a
24        million dollars.  What is it worth to live
25        every day without your soulmate?

 1             MR. KELLY:  Your Honor, that's an improper
 2        argument.  Comparative valuations are not
 3        permitted.
 4             MS. BAKER-BARNES:  It's a perfectly
 5        reasonable argument, your Honor.
 6             THE COURT:  I'll overrule.  You may
 7        proceed.
 8             MS. BAKER-BARNES:  What is the value of
 9        the time that she would have had with the love
10        of her life, the man who made it all better, 11        the man who took away all her pain?
12             I would submit to you, members of the
13        jury, we would submit to you that you take it
14        one year at time, one year at time and think
15        about every second, every minute, every hour of
16        every day that she has to spend missing not a
17        good man, not an okay man, but a fine man, a
18        great man.  And you take that number, whatever
19        it is, is it $500,000 year, is it the million
20        dollars they pay Dr. Norrell to come in here
21        and show you some newspaper clips, whatever
22        that number is, you take it and multiply it
23        times 23, every year that she has to live
24        without Charlie Piendle.
25             And you're going to get instructions in

 1        this case that you should not base your
 2        decision on sympathy, and you shouldn't, and
 3        Margaret Piendle doesn't want your sympathy,
 4        she doesn't want you to feel sorry for her,
 5        she's here for justice in this case.
 6             THE CLERK:  Counsel, ten minutes left.
 7             MS. BAKER-BARNES:  She's here for justice.
 8        And justice, a just verdict that measures all
 9        of the harm caused to Liz Piendle by the death
10        of what everyone described, everyone who came
11        in this courtroom as a great man, a great man.


12                     CLOSING ARGUMENT
13             MR. BARNHART:  Thank you.
14             We're almost finished.  I know it's been
15        hard and I know it's been long, but it's a
16        month-long trial, and we've covered -- in most
17        cases you end at the losses, but this is not
18        such a case.  You're called upon not only to
19        view the losses and conduct, but whether or not
20        these corporations should be punished for what
21        they did.  It has nothing to do with
22        compensating Liz Piendle, it has nothing to do
23        with that.  It has to do with deterrents and
24        punishment and setting an example, and the law
25        on that --

 1             Could we have that law?  I'll tell you
 2        what, it's right here.  No, it's not.
 3             MR. KELLY:  You're blocking it.
 4             MR. BARNHART:  Oh, no wonder.  Give me
 5        that extra minute for screwing up.
 6             So what happened is, it's any one of
 7        these, either/or, either/or, either/or, the
 8        conduct causing the loss -- excuse me -- to the
 9        plaintiff is so gross and flagrant as to show a
10        reckless disregard of human life or safety.
11        The conduct showed such an entire lack of care
12        that the defendant must have been consciously
13        indifferent.  They didn't care, they didn't
14        give a hoot who they hurt.  The conduct showed
15        such an entire lack of care that the defendant
16        must have wantonly or recklessly disregarded
17        the safety and the welfare of the public.
18             Well, isn't that us, disregarding the
19        safety and the welfare of the public, or their
20        all-mighty treasury.  The conduct showed such a
21        reckless indifference to the rights of others 22        as to be equivalent to an intentional violation
23        of those rights.
24             I'm not going to go through the evidence
25        again, but you know what you've seen.  There

 1        was a clear, deliberate conspiracy, a clear,
 2        deliberate plan, and they called it that, and
 3        they carried it on for 50 years, for 50 years
 4        of kids getting hooked, of people dying, people
 5        getting lung cancer and keeping people smoking.
 6             So what do we have to show to you?  We
 7        have to show to you by clear and convincing
 8        evidence -- and, boy, if this isn't clear and
 9        convincing, I don't know what evidence is --
10        that there was a violation of what, the public
11        trust, of the trust that society has with
12        either individuals or corporations to do the
13        right thing, to do what's right and not do
14        what's wrong and not deliberately mislead
15        people and not carry on a plan, not hatch a
16        plan to keep people in the dark, don't attack
17        the Surgeon General, don't attack science,
18        don't cover it up, don't give people a
19        psychological crutch.
20             So if you do find, if you do answer that,
21        yes, there was a violation, and yes, there
22        should be punitive damages assessed against the
23        defendants, then there would be Phase II of the
24        case, and that will be brief, we won't have any
25        evidence.

 1             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.  That's
 2        improper argument.
 3             MR. BARNHART:  Not at all.  Not at all,
 4        your Honor.
 5             THE COURT:  On the basis of what?
 6             MR. KELLY:  There's no suggestion that's
 7        going to be brief or long or what the evidence
 8        is going to be.
 9             THE COURT:  I'll sustain that.
10             MR. BARNHART:  There will be a phase after
11        this where evidence will come in about net
12        worth and whatever the defense wants to do.  We
13        will call no witnesses.
14             And by way of apology, I would ask that
15        you not say no just so you can get out of here,
16        because this is a very, very important case,
17        and your mission is very important.
18             All right.  So what did they do?  You know
19        what they did, they covered up, they deceived
20        about cancer, addiction, they conspired for
21        50 years, they kept millions of people smoking.
22        They hooked millions of kids, they targeted
23        children.
24             And now let's see the actual targets.  And
25        you've seen them here.  Okay.  First go back,

 1        1973.  Excuse me.  Again, Mr. Teague, research
 2        scientist.  What do we want?  We want to show
 3        adventuresome, adventurous, sophisticated adult
 4        images, smoking may enhance one's self-image if
 5        one values certain characteristics in specific
 6        individuals or certain types, like movie stars,  7        like athletes.  Then if one also smokes, he is
 8        psychologically a little more like that valued
 9        image.  Like Frank Gifford, or like if you're a
10        girl, like the woman who was singing, like
11        somebody famous, like somebody cool, like
12        somebody sexy.
13             This self-image enhancement effect has
14        traditionally been a strong promotional theme
15        for cigarette brands and should be continued to
16        be emphasized.  Continued to be emphasized.
17             Let's go to the next one if we could.
18             Realistically, if our company is to
19        survive, 1973, we must get our share of the
20        youth market.  Same kind of language,
21        self-enhancement, the fragile developing
22        self-image of the young person needs all of the
23        support and enhancement it can get.
24             So what are we going to do?  We're going
25        to support the young person, we're going to

 1        enhance their image with cigarettes, with the
 2        Marlboro Man.  And we know all the time that
 3        we're selling products that are addictive and
 4        that kill people.
 5             Next one if we could.
 6             Again, another RJR document.  Younger
 7        adult smokers, that's their language, have been
 8        the critical factor in the growth and decline
 9        of every major brand and company over the last
10        50 years.  And you know what we heard, they're
11        brand loyal.  Start with Marlboro, you tend to
12        stick with Marlboro.  You start with Winstons,
13        you tended to stick with Winstons.
14             All right.  So what did they do with kids?
15        We know this.
16             If you could.
17             You guys heard this -- well, here's
18        another one.  This is talking about high school
19        students, about Camel and Winston are holding
20        their shares, Salem is increasing among high
21        school students.  Those aren't adult smokers,
22        they're kids, they're kids.  Just like Charlie
23        Piendle.  How are we doing businesswise with
24        high school kids, with the Charlie Piendles of
25        the world?

 1             All right.  So you saw those two letters
 2        in evidence.  It's shocking, really.  "Dear
 3        students" is the first one from 1963.  "Dear
 4        students, despite many years of extensive
 5        research, medical science has been unable to
 6        establish that smoking has a direct causal link
 7        with any human disease."
 8             We know they knew that wasn't true, and
 9        they're writing to kids, elementary school
10        kids, I believe it was in this case, your
11        memory will serve you better than mine.
12             "We're firmly of the opinion that there's
13        unanswered questions.  Our company intends,
14        therefore, to continue to support such
15        research."
16             The only thing they didn't do is send free
17        samples to these kids. 18             "Dear students, medical science has been
19        unable to establish."
20             Their science did, and they knew it.
21             "Dear principal."  1990.  1990.  "In spite
22        of all the research going on, the simple and
23        unfortunate fact is that scientists do not know
24        the causes, the cause or causes of chronic
25        diseases associated with cigarette smoking."

 1             Come on, who are they kidding?  That was a
 2        blatant misstatement, and they knew it.
 3             "We appreciate" -- oh, this is the best
 4        part.  "We appreciate you passing this
 5        information, Ms. Principal, on to your
 6        students."
 7             So where does that leave us?  The evidence
 8        is overwhelming, overwhelming.  And you do need
 9        to be convinced by clear and convincing
10        evidence.  The evidence is overwhelming that
11        the actions here were reckless, they acted in
12        reckless disregard of the health and welfare of
13        the citizens of the United States, and
14        particularly their smoking customers like
15        Charlie Piendle.
16             So what did they do, they targeted
17        children.  We're in the business of selling
18        nicotine, an addicting drug.  We incorporate
19        chemicals, the filter tip, the fragile
20        developing image of the young person, build it
21        up.  You can't be comfortable with selling a
22        product which most of our customers would stop
23        using if they could.
24             The amount of evidence to indict cigarette
25        smoking as a health hazard -- that was years

 1        before they wrote those letters -- is
 2        overwhelming.  The evidence challenging this
 3        indictment is scam.
 4             To the successful defense of our present
 5        and future suits, you heard that in
 6        cross-examination.  They removed files, you
 7        heard that in the cross-examination of
 8        Dr. Figlar.  Carcinogens are found in
 9        practically every class of compounds in smoke.
10        Happily, nicotine is both and habituating and
11        unique.  Think of a cigarette dispenser as a
12        dose for nicotine.  You've seen every one of
13        these documents or heard about them.
14             THE CLERK:  Counselor, you have two
15        minutes.
16             MR. BARNHART:  Thank you.  Give me an
17        extra five if you would.
18             Compounds, it's always been a holding
19        strategy of creating doubt.  The illusion of
20        filtration is more important.  No one has ever
21        became a cigarette smoker by smoking cigarettes
22        without nicotine.
23             Boy, they sure are right there, they hit
24        the nail on the head.
25             A cigarette that does not deliver nicotine

 1        cannot satisfy, it will give our smokers a
 2        psychological crutch, and on, and on, and on.  3             And when you weigh the evidence just like
 4        we've done in the scales of justice, I submit
 5        to you there's only one conclusion.  This is
 6        wanton conduct, this is reckless conduct, this
 7        is complete disregard of the health and the
 8        safety of their customers like Charlie Piendle.
 9             Okay.  So did Philip Morris and RJR,
10        before 2000, 2001, ever admit that they were
11        addicting and killing people?  No.
12             Like Dr. Farone, remember the short little
13        clip from Dr. Farone, he was a research
14        scientist at Philip Morris, I believe he worked
15        there for eight years --
16             Oh, yeah.  That would help.
17             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and
18        transcribed as follows:)
19        Q.   Good morning, Dr. Farone.
20        A.   Good morning.
21        Q.   Would you please introduce yourself to the
22   jury?
23        A.   My name is William Anthony Farone,
24   F-A-R-O-N-E.
25        Q.   And you worked for Philip Morris for a

 1   time, Dr. Farone?
 2        A.   I did.
 3        Q.   And how long did you work for Philip
 4   Morris?
 5        A.   For eight years.
 6        Q.   Did Philip Morris, during that same period
 7   of time, refuse to share what it knew with public
 8   health authorities, all that it knew with public
 9   health authorities regarding the risks of smoking?
10        A.   Yes.
11        Q.   So when the Surgeon General said that
12   smoking was harmful to health, during your time at
13   Philip Morris, did Philip Morris ever step up on the
14   podium with the Surgeon General and say, we agree,
15   we should work together to reduce the harms
16   associated with smoking?
17        A.   No, they did not.
18        Q.   Did Philip Morris make a public commitment
19   to join together with the Surgeon General to share
20   all that it knew on addiction and health risks of
21   smoking in order to reduce those risks?
22        A.   No, they did not.
23             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)
24             MR. BARNHART:  And neither did RJR, they
25        never did, they never did what they said they

 1        were going to do with that Frank Statement,
 2        join arms with the Surgeon General to find out
 3        the causes of smoking-related diseases, they
 4        didn't to it.
 5             All right.  So what had they done, what
 6        did they do?  They deny, they deny, they deny.
 7        They deny in this trial, they continue on,
 8        deny, deny, deny, obfuscate, obfuscate,
 9        obfuscate, cover up, cover up, cover up, and
10        blame the smoker, blame the smoker.
11             Folks, this is the day, this is the
12        courtroom where you should say no more.  On
13        this day in this courtroom, we will not stand 14        for it one time longer, and that really is your
15        mission.
16             There was a 16th century poet named John
17        Donne, he wrote, "No Man is an Island."  He
18        wrote during the Great Plague in England.  And
19        he said, "Never ask for whom the bell tolls, it
20        tolls for thee."
21             And by your verdict, you should make that
22        verdict ring.  You should make that bell toll
23        in Richmond, Virginia, in the corporate offices
24        of these corporations, so that they understand
25        that this conduct will not be commons.

 1             MR. KELLY:  Objection, your Honor.  It's
 2        improper comment in this phase.
 3             MR. BARNHART:  It's punitive damages.
 4             THE COURT:  Overruled.
 5             MR. BARNHART:  Your verdict should speak
 6        the truth, and it should deter them and punish
 7        them for what they did.
 8             Thank you very much.  Thank you,
 9        your Honor.


7092                  CLOSING ARGUMENT
12             MR. SCAROLA:  Thank you very much,
13        your Honor.
14             May it please the Court, Counsel,
15        Cocounsel, Liz, and ladies and gentlemen of the
16        jury.
17             You have made extraordinary sacrifices,
18        for which I join every lawyer that has
19        addressed you and thank you.  Perhaps, some
20        day, if our paths cross outside this courtroom,
21        I'll be able to spend the time, regardless of
22        what your verdict may be, to appropriately
23        express that thanks.  For now, my
24        responsibility is to Liz and require that I
25        move on very quickly to talk about this case.

 1             Defense counsel drew an analogy to a
 2        jigsaw puzzle, and, indeed, the trial of a
 3        civil lawsuit is very much like assembling a
 4        jigsaw puzzle.  Around my house, with 13
 5        grandchildren and five granddogs running
 6        around, jigsaw puzzles don't last very long.
 7        They get opened up and maybe they get put
 8        together once, frequently they never even make
 9        it that far, pieces get lost under the couch,
10        pieces disappear and can't be found anywhere,
11        babies chew on pieces, dogs chew on pieces, the
12        cover picture gets torn off pieces, and this
13        jigsaw puzzle is not unlike that.  It is a
14        jigsaw puzzle that, in many respects, is more
15        than half a century old.
16             The pieces began to be assembled in some
17        circumstances back in the early 1900s.  Through
18        the frailty of the human body, people die,
19        Charlie Piendle died, the pieces of the puzzle
20        that he possessed left with it.  Through the
21        fallibility of human memory, people with the
22        very best of intentions do not remember
23        accurately and pieces get damaged.  Through the
24        defects in human integrity, sometimes pieces
25        get intentionally destroyed.

 1             This is a document that was marked for
 2        identification, and we dealt with a portion of
 3        it during the course of the plaintiff's
 4        presentation.  It is dated December 18, 1969
 5        from Mr. Max Crohn (phonetic) of the legal
 6        department, and it is a memo regarding
 7        invalidation of some reports in the research
 8        department.
 9             What does Mr. Crohn tell his tobacco
10        industry bosses?  We do not foresee any
11        difficulty in the event a decision is reached
12        to remove certain reports from research files.
13        Once it becomes clear that such action is
14        necessary for the successful defense of our
15        present and future suits, we will promptly 16        remove all such reports from our files.
17             We invalidate about 15 reports each year
18        for various reasons.  The most common reasons
19        for invalidating a report and/or requiring
20        rewriting are confidentiality of content, and
21        several miscellaneous reasons.  We can cite
22        misinterpretation of as data -- excuse me, of
23        data as a reason for invalidation.  As an
24        alternative to invalidation, we can have the
25        authors rewrite those sections of the reports

 1        which appear objectionable.  15 reports per
 2        year, for the 30 years that Charlie Piendle was
 3        a smoker.  450 reports intentionally removed
 4        from the historical record in anticipation of
 5        avoiding litigation problems, countless other
 6        reports rewritten in anticipation of avoiding
 7        litigation problems.
 8             And so what we are left with in assembling
 9        this jigsaw puzzle are the fragments that
10        remained, that escaped the intentional effort
11        to cleanse the record of damaging evidence, but
12        that's not unusual.  People who do bad things
13        do everything they can to avoid being held
14        responsible for the bad things they do.
15             And if our efforts were to stop because
16        this puzzle has been damaged, if they were to
17        stop because Charlie Piendle was killed by
18        addiction to cigarettes, if they were to stop
19        because we don't have every document in the
20        historic record, justice could not be done and
21        so we must deal with the evidence that is
22        available and the standard that does not
23        require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but
24        proof by the greater weight of the evidence.
25        We must construct the best picture that can be

 1        constructed from the evidence that is available
 2        and deal with the probabilities.
 3             Now, sometimes those probabilities are in
 4        the form of statistics.  And as opposing
 5        counsel has pointed out, where there is direct
 6        evidence, we need not rely on statistics.  The
 7        fact that 80 percent of smokers do not get lung
 8        cancer, they get COPD, they die of emphysema,
 9        they die of heart problems, they die of a whole
10        lot of other reasons, but only 20 percent get
11        lung cancer.  It doesn't mean that it is not
12        probable that Charlie Piendle got lung cancer,
13        because the direct evidence establishes that
14        Charlie Piendle died of smoking-related lung
15        cancer, by stipulation.  It was so
16        overwhelming, so compelling that the defendants
17        have not contested the fact that Charlie
18        Piendle died because he contracted cancer of
19        the lung from 30 years of smoking.
20             I want to begin with an overview of the
21        defense case because, in effect, what they have
22        told us is we manufactured lies.  We presented
23        smoking as sexy, sophisticated, safe, a safe
24        source of relaxation, a safe means by which to
25        relieve stress, and that was a lie.  But they
7097  1        tell us it was Charlie's choice to be stupid
 2        enough to believe us.  It's his fault that he
 3        believed what we were telling Charlie and
 4        telling everybody else for decades.  You can
 5        smoke and it's safe because it hasn't been
 6        established that smoking causes cancer.  We
 7        spent tens and hundreds of millions of dollars
 8        every year advertising our lies, but pieces of
 9        the truth must have penetrated into Charlie's
10        information environment, he must have learned
11        the truth in spite of our lies, so it was
12        Charlie's choice to be stupid enough to believe
13        the lies we advertised, to believe the lies we
14        told in full-page ads, in newspapers, in every
15        city with a population of 250,000 or more
16        across the United States.  You had to be stupid
17        to believe us.  It was Charlie's choice,
18        Charlie's stupid choice to be influenced by
19        that information in the environment.
20             We promoted the lies through front
21        organizations and even paid the AMA $10 million
22        for research at the same time the AMA agreed
23        not to support package warnings.  Don't need
24        warnings on cigarettes, everybody knows.  You
25        can shout it from the rooftops and you won't be

 1        telling anybody what they don't already know.
 2        But as we now know, there is such a big
 3        difference between knowing and believing and
 4        that's a distinction that the defendants knew,
 5        took calculated advantage of, and profited on
 6        at the expense of hundreds of thousands of
 7        deaths every year.
 8             The public health officials, like the
 9        Surgeon General, they were telling the truth
10        and Charlie had a choice as to who to believe.
11        Don't blame us because he was stupid enough to
12        believe us.  Does that really make sense?  We
13        denied the lies for 50 years.  But Charlie had
14        a choice because we were forced to put warning
15        labels on cigarette packages.
16             Remember the television interview of the
17        tobacco executive from these defendants who
18        stood up there and said, oh, yeah, the warnings
19        are on cigarettes, it says they may be
20        hazardous to your health.  That doesn't mean
21        they are hazardous to your health, and we
22        certainly don't believe they're hazardous to
23        your health.  Those warning don't mean
24        anything.
25             And Charlie was stupid enough to believe

 1        the tobacco industry.  Because Charlie, like
 2        hundreds of thousands of others in the words of
 3        Dr. Michael Cummings, had had his brain
 4        highjacked by nicotine, and he searched the
 5        information environment for the psychological
 6        crutches and the rationalizations that would
 7        allow him to continue to satisfy the need for
 8        nicotine that the defendants understood existed
 9        and took calculated advantage of to profit at
10        the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives
11        every year. 12             We qualified the lies.  We still don't
13        really know for sure, it's not proven,
14        statistical links don't mean causation, maybe
15        it's really genetics or rainfall or air
16        pollution.  Nicotine occurs naturally.
17             Well, you know, it really depends on what
18        you mean by "addiction," but Charlie had a
19        choice, because Charlie was a tough,
20        strong-willed Marine, and anyone can break an
21        addiction.  If you have the information, if you
22        know the truth, anyone can break their
23        addiction.  Was Charlie any smarter than Peter
24        Jennings?  Was he any smarter than Harry
25        Reasoner?  Was he any smarter, any less

 1        strong-willed that Barack Obama?  Did he have
 2        less motivation than the president of the
 3        United States who knows he is setting an
 4        example for the world, as well as his two young
 5        girls, but just can't break his addiction?
 6             We repeat the new lie over and over and
 7        over again.  Choice, choice, choice.  But
 8        Charlie, we know from the evidence, Charlie
 9        began to lose his free choice after five packs
10        of cigarettes.  101 cigarettes and he began to
11        lose his free choice and move on that line
12        closer and closer to the powerful cycle of
13        nicotine addiction.  Charlie had a choice, but
14        the choice became more and more and more
15        constrained, the deeper into the process of
16        addiction, he was drawn by the defendants'
17        lies.  And it was the defendants' lies that
18        killed Charlie Piendle.
19             Now, I want to try very quickly to go
20        through a pretty substantial number of points
21        that were made by the defense, and this is
22        going to be disjoined and it's going to be
23        fast, but I want to get through as many as I
24        can before I move on to some other things that
25        respond to defense arguments that were made.

 1             You were -- you were told that your
 2        verdict should not be based on sympathy.  You
 3        were told that by Greg, by Sia, by both defense
 4        lawyers, and you're being told that by me as
 5        well, and I want to draw an important
 6        distinction for you and it is this.  Sympathy,
 7        in very simple terms, means you hurt and I hurt
 8        with you, and any verdict that is rendered out
 9        of a sense of shared hurt is an unjust verdict,
10        you cannot do that.
11             There's another word that is important.
12        In describing not only what you can do, but
13        what you must do and that word is empathy.
14        Empathy means you hurt and I understand.  To
15        the same extent that a verdict rendered on the
16        basis of sympathy is an unjust verdict, a
17        verdict rendered without a full and complete
18        understanding of the loss, the magnitude of the
19        loss that Liz Piendle has suffered, is an
20        unjust verdict.  No sympathy, but a verdict
21        that reflects a full and complete understanding
22        of the loss that Liz has suffered for the last 23        14 years and will continue to suffer through
24        the end of Charlie Piendle's statistical life
25        expectancy, another nine years, had his life

 1        not been shortened by 23 years as a consequence
 2        of the misconduct of these defendants.
 3             The Court will not tell you that a medical
 4        diagnosis is necessary with respect to
 5        addiction, it's nowhere in your instructions.
 6        The Court will also not define "addiction" for
 7        you, but we know what addiction is.  We know
 8        that the definition of "addiction" was changed
 9        in 1988.  We know that that definition of
10        addiction was arrived at through a consensus of
11        the scientific community, and the defendants
12        may not like it, but it is the definition that
13        today we deal with, and under the terms of that
14        definition, there is no question about the fact
15        that Charlie Piendle, smoking two packs of
16        cigarettes a day for the better part of the
17        30 years, was addicted to nicotine.  The
18        evidence in this case clearly, convincingly,
19        beyond a reasonable doubt, establishes that
20        addiction and it certainly establishes that
21        addiction by way of a preponderance of the
22        evidence.
23             If the defendants really thought -- and,
24        incidentally, they make reference to the
25        DSM-IV.  The DSM-IV is not a medical

 1        definition.  It is used by doctors.  It is used
 2        by medical doctors.  It is used by
 3        psychologists.  It is used by those individuals
 4        who treat nicotine addiction.  And if the
 5        defendants really thought that there was
 6        someone whose credentials you would respect who
 7        could come in here and tell you, I have
 8        examined the record in this case, Charlie
 9        Piendle is not addicted pursuant to the
10        criteria of the DSM-IV, is there any doubt in
11        your minds that you would have had that
12        individual take the witness stand and you would
13        have had an opportunity to judge his demeanor,
14        to see him subjected to cross-examination and
15        to evaluate the credibility of the conclusion
16        that he expressed?
17             But they didn't call any such person, and
18        every individual who addressed the issue of
19        Charlie Piendle's addiction from a professional
20        perspective told you uniformly, there is no
21        doubt Charlie Piendle was addicted.
22             You saw repeatedly the definition of
23        concurring cause -- excuse me, the definition
24        of legal cause.  What you were not shown is the
25        second half of the definition that also

 1        appears, one, two, three, four, five times, and
 2        it is basically the same each time, we just
 3        substitute in the different word in the front
 4        the same way the defendants substituted a
 5        different word in the front.  Addiction may be
 6        a legal cause of death even though it operates
 7        in combination with the act of another, some  8        natural cause or some other cause, if the
 9        addiction contributes substantially to
10        producing such death.  That's the burden that
11        we have, that's the burden that we accept.
12             Did the conduct of the defendants, did the
13        addiction that they caused, did each of the
14        other elements, defective and unreasonably
15        dangerous cigarettes, concealment, reliance,
16        negligence, did each of those or any one of
17        those contribute substantially to producing
18        Charlie Piendle's death?
19             And as we go through this, hopefully, I
20        will have the opportunity to take you through
21        it, you will see that the evidence is
22        overwhelming that the defendants' conduct was a
23        substantially contributing factor in every
24        circumstance to Charlie's death.
25             Withdrawal symptoms.  I'm going to skip

 1        ahead.
 2             There has been a significant attack on the
 3        credibility of Liz Piendle.  I ask you, ladies
 4        and gentlemen, if Liz Piendle were a person who
 5        was inclined to shade the truth to help her
 6        case, don't you think that you would have heard
 7        about all kinds of withdrawal symptoms that
 8        Charlie Piendle experienced, if she were a
 9        person whose integrity was such that she would
10        alter the facts as she remembers them, there
11        isn't anybody who could come into this
12        courtroom and tell you that there weren't 20
13        attempts to quit.  Liz could have made up some
14        really good stories about quit attempts,
15        efforts on her part and Charlie's part to put
16        away the cigarettes, to throw out all the
17        ashtrays, to destroy the lighters, but after 14
18        years, that wasn't the truth that Liz
19        remembered and wasn't -- wasn't an untruth that
20        she was prepared to testify to.  She respected
21        her oath.  She told the truth.
22             When she was asked about significant
23        relationships, she disclosed the relationship
24        that she continued -- that she considered to be
25        significant, and it is, indeed, unfortunate

 1        that having suffered the tragedy, the tragedies
 2        in her life that she has suffered, that she
 3        must suffer one more tragedy at the hands of
 4        these defendants and be accused openly in this
 5        courtroom of dishonesty.
 6             MR. HENK:  Your Honor, I object to that.
 7        The defendants are allowed to defend themselves
 8        in this case and present evidence to the jury
 9        without a conclusion being drawn that this is
10        somehow a personal attack.
11             THE COURT:  I'll sustain that objection.
12             MR. SCAROLA:  And what if Charlie, indeed,
13        showed no blatant, open, and obvious withdrawal
14        symptoms?  Who was this man?
15             Charlie Piendle was an individual who had
16        suffered silently for more than half his life.
17        He was stoic, he was tough, he hid his pain, he
18        didn't want the nurse changing his colostomy 19        bag because he was proud, even as he laid on
20        his death bed, dying of cancer.  This was a man
21        who wasn't going to complain about insomnia or
22        increased appetite or whatever the other
23        symptoms were that were included on the
24        defendants' list.
25             Can I have the half-a-pack-a-day slide,

 1        please, Jeff.
 2             The defense stands up and tells you the
 3        medical records reflect that Charlie Piendle
 4        was only smoking half a pack a day.  You're
 5        going to have a chance to take a look at those
 6        medical records.
 7             Enlarge the top for us, if you would,
 8        please.
 9             This is the document on the left-hand side
10        that you were shown, Charlie Piendle's medical
11        record, date of admission 3/17/75, transcribed
12        3/27/75, 10 days later.  This is the document
13        that says down here, "The patient smokes a half
14        a pack per day and has an occasional alcoholic
15        drink."
16             Well, let's take a look at what the
17        records really show.  The document on the right
18        is the handwritten form that is filled out from
19        which the typed form was transcribed.
20        Admission date March 17, 1975, Charlie Piendle.
21             Next page, please.
22             Right down here, Social History, social
23        history, "Smokes one and a half packs per day.
24        Occasional alcohol."  So the defense comes in
25        and tells you Charlie was only smoking half a

 1        pack a day, but ladies and gentlemen of the
 2        jury --
 3             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection, that
 4        mischaracterizes the argument that was made,
 5        your Honor.
 6             THE COURT:  Sustain the objection.
 7             MR. SCAROLA:  Well, you just heard what
 8        was said.  I leave it up to you to remember the
 9        way in which this was presented to you, but
10        there's the evidence.  The evidence isn't half
11        a pack a day, the evidence is there was a
12        transcription error, somebody goofed.  The
13        social history is a pack and a half a day.
14        It's the lowest figure that appears anywhere in
15        not dozens, but hundreds of pages of medical
16        records of Charlie Piendle where time after
17        time after time it is reflected that Charlie
18        was smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.
19             We're going to get to textbooks in a
20        little while.
21             The defense tells you there was no legal
22        obligation to cause Charlie Piendle and other
23        smokers to internalize the knowledge they were
24        given about the health hazards of smoking.  I
25        think I took those words down almost verbatim

 1        and they're right.  There is, however, a legal
 2        obligation not to actively prevent smokers from
 3        turning knowledge into belief.  There is a  4        legal obligation not to intentionally provide
 5        psychological crutches and bases for
 6        rationalizations that have no foundation, in
 7        fact.  There is a legal obligation not to do
 8        that.  And Charlie Piendle responded to those
 9        psychological crutches and those
10        self-rationales, provided on the basis of lies
11        by the defendants exactly the way in which the
12        defendants wanted him to respond.
13             You are told by both defendants that
14        Charlie Piendle would have bought someone
15        else's dangerous cigarettes if he weren't
16        buying the cigarettes of these defendants.
17             Well, first of all, I suggest to you
18        that's true only if Charlie Piendle didn't know
19        the truth and didn't believe the truth and only
20        if Charlie Piendle had become addicted to
21        nicotine as a consequence of having had the
22        truth concealed from him.  They tell you
23        there's no evidence that Charlie Piendle would
24        have smoked less dangerous cigarettes if they
25        were available, but Charlie Piendle did smoke

 1        less dangerous cigarettes when they became
 2        available.  He smoked Dorals and Merits,
 3        advertised as the lowest tar and nicotine
 4        brands.  He switched to those --
 5             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection, your Honor,
 6        mischaracterizes the evidence.
 7             THE COURT:  Response.
 8             MR. SCAROLA:  I believe, your Honor, that
 9        that's exactly what the evidence demonstrated
10        and the jury, obviously, can rely upon their
11        own notes, if somehow I have not remembered
12        that accurately, but that's not an appropriate
13        legal objection.
14             Mr. Barnhart did not tell you the design
15        modifications were forced by law.  What he told
16        you were that the warnings were compelled by
17        law and that the design modifications, every
18        one of them, if you remember that graphic in
19        your mind about all of the design changes in
20        cigarettes, every one of them was tied right
21        back to profit, every one of them tied right
22        back to profit.
23             Two-thirds of male former smokers said it
24        wasn't very hard to quit.  Well, they weren't
25        the first to say it.  It's easy to quit

 1        smoking, I've done it thousands of times.  You
 2        are told that the plaintiff has tried to avoid
 3        the effect of the information environment on
 4        Charlie Piendle, and you were also told that
 5        with the ability to quit comes the
 6        responsibility to quit, and I agree.
 7             From the outset of this case, we have
 8        agreed, but with the ability to tell the truth
 9        comes the responsibility to tell the truth,
10        with the ability to design and manufacture
11        safer cigarettes comes the responsibility to
12        design and manufacture safer cigarettes.  With
13        the ability to research health issues
14        associated with a product that you are selling 15        comes the responsibility to research those
16        health issues.
17             Remember Dr. Figlar's testimony, we've
18        never done any research on addiction, we didn't
19        even have a research department in spite of
20        everything that was being said about the links
21        between smoking and cancer, didn't even have a
22        research department until 1953.  We're not the
23        ones who done the research on smoking and
24        health hazards.  With the ability to make
25        public health considerations the primary

 1        concern comes the responsibility to make public
 2        health considerations the primary concern, not
 3        consumer acceptability, which when you get
 4        right down to it means profit.  The number one
 5        concern of these defendants, we are told by
 6        Dr. Figlar himself, had historically been and
 7        remains consumer acceptability.  Safety comes
 8        second to the question, will our products sell.
 9        That's the way it's always been for the
10        defense.  That's the way the defendants
11        continue to conduct their business, consumer
12        acceptability is number one, public health
13        falls somewhere low on the list, and nowhere on
14        the list at all, when and if it ever conflicts
15        with profit.
16             With the ability to keep promises made in
17        full-page advertisements, made on television,
18        made before the U.S. Congress comes the
19        responsibility to keep those promises.  If we
20        ever find out our cigarettes cause cancer, we
21        will immediately tell the general public.
22             (Thereupon, the video clips were played
23        and transcribed as follows:)
24             THE HOST:  Suppose the tremendous amount
25        of research now going on, including that of the

 1        Tobacco Industry Research Committee, were to
 2        reveal that there is a cancer-causing agent in
 3        cigarettes, what then?
 4             MR. LITTLE:  Well, if it was found by
 5        somebody working under the tobacco industry
 6        research grant, it would be made public
 7        immediately, and just as broadly as we could
 8        make it and then efforts would be taken to
 9        attempt to remove that substance or substances.
10             THE HOST:  Are you saying, then, sir, that
11        there are -- there is something toxic about
12        tobacco which are removable by filter?
13             MR. LITTLE:  Well, obviously, a filter
14        takes out certain tar and nicotine.  I don't
15        think the industry admits there are any bad
16        elements.  If there are bad elements, through
17        our laboratories, through the Surgeon General,
18        through the AMA, through acts of God and luck,
19        we hope we may find them, and if they have
20        found them, they will be removed, but at this
21        point, we do not know.
22             But we do talk to the question of whether
23        or not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not
24        believe that cigarettes are hazardous, we don't
25        accept that.  When, as, and if any ingredient 7114
 1        in cigarette smoke is identified as being
 2        injurious to human health, we are confident
 3        that we can eliminate that ingredient.
 4             THE HOST:  Do you believe that cigarettes
 5        are safe?  Have they been proved to be safe,
 6        Mr. Cullman?
 7             MR. LITTLE:  I believe they have not been
 8        proven to be unsafe.
 9             (New video clip played.)
10             MR. STOSSEL:  We asked Philip Morris,
11        R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, and
12        Lorillard to appear on this program.  None
13        would.  They told us to talk to The Tobacco
14        Institute, the Institute said Anne Browder will
15        speak to them.
16             MS. BROWDER:  The jury has not come in.
17             MR. STOSSEL:  It may not be harmful,
18        you're not convinced.
19             MS. BROWDER:  It may be or it may not be,
20        we don't know.
21             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)
22             MR. SCAROLA:  The defendants stubbornly
23        clung to the positions that they took in the
24        early '60s for too long, for much too long the
25        defense tells you, but Charlie Piendle had a

 1        choice, he didn't have to believe us, he was
 2        just too stupid not to have recognized the fact
 3        that we were lying for decades.  So it's
 4        Charlie's fault, not ours, he chose to believe
 5        our lies.
 6             You are told the Marlboro Man didn't exist
 7        before 1962.  Well, if you remember the
 8        testimony from Dr. Cummings, who I believe was
 9        the one who addressed that subject, what he
10        said was that the Marlboro Man came into
11        regular use within the company in 1962.  The
12        1956 annual report, the 1957 annual report, and
13        if you take a look at the 1959 annual report
14        that is also in evidence, and I venture to
15        suggest to you every annual report of the
16        company from 1956 on, you are going to see the
17        Marlboro Man, the same individual that looked
18        down on Charlie and his friends every day
19        across the street from the candy store.
20             Now, both defendants spent a great deal of
21        time talking to you about whether the
22        information concealed from Charlie Piendle made
23        a difference, you-all remember that, a lot of
24        talk about that.
25             Here are the instructions on the law.  If

 1        you find that Charlie Piendle was a member of
 2        the Engle class, you are instructed as a matter
 3        of law that RJR and Philip Morris concealed or
 4        omitted material information not otherwise
 5        known or available knowing that the material
 6        was false or misleading or failed to disclose a
 7        material fact with the intention that smokers
 8        and the public would rely on this information
 9        to their detriment.
10             Well, now what does that mean, "material 11        information"?  Well, the Court, and I think
12        it's the very next instruction in the package
13        that you have received, the Court tells you
14        what a material fact is.  You've just been told
15        the defendants concealed material facts.  A
16        material fact is one that is of such
17        importance, Charles Piendle would not have
18        acted as he did but for the concealment or
19        omission.  As a matter of law, as you have been
20        instructed and as you have sworn an oath to
21        follow those instructions, the information
22        concealed from Charlie was of such importance,
23        Charles Piendle would not have acted as he did
24        but for the concealment.
25             MR. HENK:  Objection, your Honor.

 1             MR. KELLY:  Objection.  That was a
 2        misinterpretation of the law, it's a
 3        misstatement of the law, and inapplicable
 4        argument with respect to the findings.
 5             THE COURT:  What's your preference to the
 6        actual instruction?
 7             MR. SCAROLA:  That is exactly what I have
 8        on the board, your Honor, the actual
 9        instruction that the Court has given the jury,
10        defining what a material fact is.
11             THE COURT:  Is the objection to the yellow
12        sticky?
13             MR. KELLY:  Sorry?
14             THE COURT:  Is the objection to the yellow
15        sticky?
16             MR. HENK:  Yes, your Honor.
17             MR. KELLY:  I wasn't sure what you said,
18        your Honor.  No, it's to the argument that
19        plaintiff does not have to establish reliance
20        because the findings establish reliance.
21             MR. SCAROLA:  Oh, I haven't said that at
22        all.
23             MR. KELLY:  It's absolutely improper.
24             THE COURT:  Why don't you restate what you
25        said with respect to the law, because the

 1        instruction speaks to reliance.
 2             MR. SCAROLA:  What I said is that as a
 3        matter of law, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris
 4        concealed material information.  The Court
 5        tells you what a material fact is, one that is
 6        of such importance, Charles Piendle would not
 7        have acted as he did but for the concealment or
 8        omission.
 9             Philip Morris, who did not call a single
10        witness, not one, tells us there's little
11        evidence that Marlboro was smoked for any
12        significant period of time.  And in the
13        division of responsibility, they say Philip
14        Morris should have none.  What Philip Morris
15        would like you to ignore is the fact that once
16        it has been established that Charlie Piendle is
17        a member of the Engle class, then we know,
18        because it has been established and we are
19        obliged to accept the fact, that R.J. Reynolds
20        and Philip Morris and other tobacco companies
21        that have been specifically identified entered 22        into an agreement.  They acted in concert.
23        They concealed or omitted material information.
24        They agreed to conceal or omit information
25        regarding the health effects of cigarettes.

 1        What they did, they did together.  Which brand
 2        Charlie Piendle smoked, I suggest to you makes
 3        no difference at all.  They acted in concert.
 4        They were cooperating to achieve the same
 5        result and they did achieve that result.
 6             Charlie Piendle is a tobacco industry
 7        success story.  Charlie Piendle began smoking
 8        in response to the information environment that
 9        the tobacco industry created.  Now, they will
10        tell you he started smoking in response to peer
11        pressure, but the peer pressure was
12        manufactured by the tobacco industry.  It was
13        the tobacco industry that made smoking sexy,
14        sophisticated, powerful, macho, and safe, and
15        they worked together to create that environment
16        to establish an information environment in
17        which peer pressure caused 70 percent of the
18        males in the United States, during that period
19        of time, to become smokers, most of whom, the
20        vast majority of whom began their smoking long
21        before age 18.
22             You are asked if Philip Morris shut down,
23        would Charlie Piendle still have smoked?  Well,
24        if Philip Morris had shut down, Philip Morris
25        wouldn't be here.  If R.J. Reynolds, instead of

 1        endangering the health of the general public,
 2        instead of concealing the information they
 3        knew, if Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds had
 4        both decided they were not going to participate
 5        in this agreement, they weren't going to sell
 6        defective products, they wouldn't be here in
 7        this courtroom.
 8             THE CLERK:  Counselor, ten minutes.
 9             MR. SCAROLA:  Thank you very much.
10             What kind of defense is it to say, if we
11        didn't rob the bank, somebody else would have.
12        If we didn't break into Liz Piendle's house,
13        somebody else would have.  If we didn't kill
14        Liz Piendle's husband --
15             MR. HENK:  Objection.
16             MR. SCAROLA:  -- somebody else would have.
17             MR. HENK:  Objection, your Honor.  As you
18        have instructed the jury, selling cigarettes is
19        a legal activity.  Everything that Mr. Scarola
20        is describing is illegal.
21             THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection,
22        but that instruction is noted and it's part of
23        what the jury has been instructed on with
24        respect to the legality of selling cigarettes.
25             MR. SCAROLA:  My mom and dad used to tell

 1        me, I don't care what everybody else is doing,
 2        it's wrong and you shouldn't do it.  Common
 3        sense tells us that what everybody else is
 4        doing is not an excuse, it is not a defense, it
 5        is not a justification for the kind of improper
 6        conduct in which these defendants have engaged.  7             What if?  What if?  What if the defendants
 8        really had put people's health paramount over
 9        profit and had designed, manufactured,
10        marketed, and sold only the safest cigarettes
11        that science would enable them to have designed
12        in the '50s, in the '60s, in the '70s, and the
13        '80s, instead of the defective and unreasonably
14        dangerous cigarettes it has already been proven
15        that they did sell?
16             What if when the defendants told us in the
17        Frank Statement, we accept an interest in
18        people's health as basic responsibility
19        paramount to every other consideration in our
20        business, what if they really acted in
21        accordance with those words?  But they didn't.
22        That was their real number one consideration.
23             What if the defendants' number one
24        consideration was what they told the American
25        people it was in 1954?  Reader's Digest,

 1        August 1957, secrecy is the rule in the
 2        cigarette industry, research is guarded
 3        jealously, developments immediately become
 4        highly classified trade secrets.
 5             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection, your Honor.
 6        It's not for the truth of the matter asserted.
 7             THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.
 8             MR. SCAROLA:  I'm not presenting it as in
 9        for the truth of the matter asserted, your
10        Honor, although I don't believe that there was
11        any limiting instruction.
12             In 1954, people's health was supposed to
13        have been paramount to every other
14        consideration in their business.  The brands
15        that sell the best are those with the least
16        effecting -- effective filters and the
17        strongest tobacco, improved filtration might
18        even be unprofitable.
19             MR. BIERSTEKER:  Objection, your Honor.
20        He's precisely using it for an impermissible
21        purpose.
22             THE COURT:  Do counsel want to approach or
23        do you want to move on to the next subject?
24             MR. SCAROLA:  I will move on.  This is the
25        information that was in the information

 1        environment.
 2             What if the defendants had told Charlie
 3        Piendle and everyone with influence over him
 4        the whole truth as soon as they knew it?  What
 5        if they told his parents, what if they told his
 6        friends, what if they told his teachers?  What
 7        if they told the United States of America the
 8        whole truth as soon as they knew it instead of
 9        concealing and omitting material information
10        and failing to disclose material facts
11        concerning the health effects or addictive
12        nature of smoking, as it has already been
13        established they did?  What if the whole truth
14        had been told, instead of polluting the
15        information environment with psychological
16        crutches and rationalizations to keep people
17        smoking, despite the Surgeon General's 18        warnings?
19             What if they didn't manufacture
20        controversies and acknowledged the scientific
21        truth that had been arrived at by a consensus
22        of every respected scientist in the world?
23        What if they weren't advertising and marketing
24        lies?  What if, instead of manufacturing
25        psychological crutches and rationalizations to

 1        keep smoking -- to keep people smoking, what if
 2        they told Charlie the truth?  What if they did?
 3        But they did everything they could to keep
 4        Charlie and his parents and his friends and
 5        everyone in Bridgeport, Connecticut and
 6        everyone in the United States believing lies.
 7             What if, instead of telling the public the
 8        Surgeon General was acting responsibly and
 9        engaging in scare tactics, they joined hands
10        with public health officials?
11             We know what would have happened because
12        it did happen, the Surgeon General's report
13        came out, cigarette sales plummeted until the
14        disinformation campaign, the pollution of the
15        information environment, the lies, the campaign
16        of misinformation was effectively carried out
17        by the cigarette industry.
18             We know what would have happened because
19        it began to happen, and what if they didn't do
20        that?  What if either one of these defendants,
21        either one of them had broken ranks with the
22        tobacco industry conspiracy?  What if they had
23        said, I'm going to stand up and tell the truth
24        and I don't care what the rest of you are
25        doing?  Can anyone say that that probably

 1        wouldn't have made a difference?  Because once
 2        the conspiracy begins to fall, it crumbles.
 3             THE CLERK:  Counselor, two minutes.
 4             MR. SCAROLA:  And it only takes one.
 5             What if Philip Morris had published a
 6        pamphlet like this, "Raising Kids Who Don't
 7        Smoke" in 1958?  What if the defendants had
 8        exercised reasonable care in every aspect of
 9        their business instead of having acted
10        negligently with respect to every aspect of
11        their business?
12             MR. BIERSTEKER:  I object to the last,
13        your Honor, it invites speculation as to the
14        findings.
15             THE COURT:  I'm sorry, as to the --
16             MR. BIERSTEKER:  The last comment invites
17        speculation as to the findings, that argument
18        was acting negligently with respect to every
19        aspect of their business not supported by the
20        findings or the evidence.
21             THE COURT:  Sustain the objection.
22             MR. SCAROLA:  I suggest it is directly
23        supported by the evidence, your Honor.
24             MR. KELLY:  What was the ruling,
25        your Honor?

 1             THE COURT:  Sustain the objection.
 2             MR. SCAROLA:  Isn't it at least probable  3        that every one of those things made a
 4        difference to Charlie Piendle, made a
 5        difference to public health in the United
 6        States, and likely would have altered the
 7        outcome of Charlie Piendle's addiction had
 8        these defendants done what these defendants
 9        should have done.
10             There's probably another hour there,
11        things I'm never going to get to tell you, but
12        things that I am confident that you already
13        know.  You have listened to this evidence
14        attentively, you have heard counsel speak of
15        the statute of justice, a strong woman
16        blindfolded, blind to power and prestige,
17        carrying a scale in one hand and a sword in the
18        other, and when those scales are intentionally
19        unbalanced, when there is a reckless disregard
20        for the public safety of hundreds of thousands
21        of people for the purpose of profit, then lady
22        justice is prepared to use that sword.
23             And, gentlemen, I don't mean to disregard
24        you, nor to suggest a gender change for you,
25        but all of you have your hands on that sword as

 1        a consequence of the power imposed on you when
 2        you took your oath --
 3             MR. HENK:  Objection, your Honor.
 4             MR. SCAROLA:  -- as jurors in this case.
 5             MR. HENK:  I'm sorry to interrupt, but
 6        objection.  There's an apparent suggestion that
 7        the jury use a sword against the defendants,
 8        your Honor.  This is inappropriate.
 9             MR. SCAROLA:  That is exactly what I am
10        suggesting, your Honor.  I am suggesting --
11             MR. HENK:  Then may we approach?
12             THE COURT:  Do you want to approach?
13             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were
14        held out of the presence of the jury:)
15             MR. HENK:  I'm going to move for a
16        mistrial.  He cannot suggest that the jury use
17        a sword against the defendants, that's
18        completely inappropriate argument.  He
19        confirmed that he is --
20             THE COURT:  What is the response?
21             MR. SCAROLA:  It is the sword of truth, it
22        is the sword of justice, it is the symbolic
23        sword that justice herself carry and entirely
24        appropriate to use in punitive damages that it
25        should be used.

 1             THE COURT:  I'd like a clarification that
 2        it's a sword of justice.
 3             MR. SCAROLA:  I was about to do that.
 4             THE COURT:  It's sustained as far as using
 5        the word "sword," but -- motion is denied.
 6             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was
 7        concluded and the following proceedings were
 8        held within the presence of the jury:)
 9             MR. SCAROLA:  The sword you hold is the
10        sword of justice and it is the sword of truth
11        and it is the sword that empowers you to right
12        the terrible wrongs that have been done to Liz
13        Piendle and to set an example, through your 14        verdict in this case, that this kind of conduct
15        will not be tolerated any longer.
16             Thank you so very much.
