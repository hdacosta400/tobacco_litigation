DEFENDANTS' CLOSING ARGUMENT ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES PHASE 
MR. REILLY:  Your Honor, I don't use the podium.
THE COURT:  Okay.
MR. REILLY:  So let me just do this.  Because we
have a limited amount of time, Your Honor has allowed us
15 minutes.  
Let me correct counsel's math.  Five times six is not
40.  Five times six is 30 last time I checked it out.  But
$30 million, for goodness' sakes.
Let me back up and say, as I started to say a little
while ago, obviously you guys came to a different
conclusion than what I thought you should, but this is your
job.  You are the jurors.  You have to do what you think is
right.  That's why you have the job you have.  And we
respect the decisions you made.  Okay?
But now you have a new decision to make, and let me
direct you to the instructions that you're going to get in
this case, and in particular, the one that addresses the
   143
 1
amount of punitive damages.  This comes directly from His
 2
Honor.  
 3
It says:  With regard to the amount of punitive damages
 4
to be assessed, you should consider -- and it has three
 5
items, and the third item here is any mitigating behavior
 6
of each defendant and whether there is a continuing need to
 7
punish for and/or deterrence.
 8
Now, frankly, ladies and gentlemen, that's why I'm
 9
standing before you at this moment, to explain to you
things that weren't relevant, I couldn't have told you
about in the prior phase of this trial, and that is, some
of it actually came in through plaintiff's experts
Drs. Cummings and Burns, the changes that have occurred at
Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.  
For a couple of different reasons.  You already
heard -- and I think we have a timeline.  Do we have -- are
you ready to put that up?  I can't see it so you'll have to
tell me if it's up.  I'm going to -- obviously you know I
love timelines.  So it's a very short timeline, though.
We'll start in 1999, and I want to revisit with you
what happened in 1999.  I don't know exactly because I
haven't spoken to you, I'll never have the opportunity to
speak to you, but obviously there are some things that
upset you about the conduct of Philip Morris and
R.J. Reynolds.  And I don't want to pretend like I don't
   144
 1
know what they may have been.  One of them may have been
 2
that, as I said to you in my opening statement in the prior
 3
phase, I said I think they clung too long to the notion
 4
that smoking hasn't been proved to cause lung cancer.
 5
Right?  
 6
And in fact, as of 1999, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds
 7
took a completely different direction.  They created
 8
websites.  And now you see on this timeline 1999, Philip
 9
Morris, R.J. Reynolds created websites in which they said,
"Hey, World, hey America, smoking causes lung cancer.
Smoking is addictive."  They -- nevermore could they take
the position that smoking hadn't been proved.
In 1999, they said smoking is addictive.  They said
there's no such things as a safe cigarette.  No more, never
again.  Nevermore.  All those people you saw on those
videos, you know how old those videos are, right?  You know
those people are dead and gone.  They don't exist anymore.
Those aren't the people that run these companies.  Dead and
gone.
In 2005, you didn't like advertising, you thought they
shouldn't have advertising.  Philip Morris has no more
magazine advertising, no more billboard advertising.  That
went away in 1999.  Billboard advertising all gone, 1999.
You thought you didn't like the Tobacco Institute.
Gone 1999.  You thought you didn't like Council for Tobacco
   145
 1
Research.  Gone 1999.  You thought you didn't like
 2
advertising in magazines.  For Philip Morris, gone 2005.
 3
Gone.  None.  You can't go to the store, open up a magazine
 4
and find an ad for a Marlboro or a Merit or -- it's not
 5
there.  Doesn't exist.
 6
Changed company.  Absolutely.  Changed company, R.J.
 7
Reynolds, absolutely.
 8
MS. LONDON:  I object.  There's no evidence that
 9
he's discussing.
THE COURT:  Overruled.
MR. REILLY:  Thank you.
And 2009.  What happened in 2009?  In 2009 Congress
enacted federal legislation that put the entire tobacco
industry, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, every cigarette
manufacturer in this country under the control of the Food
and Drug Administration.
You heard in Phase I that Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds
made cigarettes, engineered cigarettes so that they were as
addictive as humanly possible to keep people addicted,
right?
The constituents in cigarette smoke are now controlled
by the FDA.  They can tell the tobacco industry in, out,
in, out.  The amount of nicotine in cigarettes, controlled
completely by the Food and Drug Administration.  If they
think that the levels of nicotine in cigarettes are too
   146
 1
high or that the design of cigarettes is wrong, the FDA
 2
gets to control it.  Period.  End of story.  No debate.
 3
They can restrict what the companies say about their
 4
products in literally any respect.  They have the authority
 5
to enforce all these rules and regulations that they
 6
create.  They can shut companies down.  They can make it so
 7
they can't sell their products.  They have complete control
 8
because of federal legislation.  They have complete control
 9
over the design, manufacture, and marketing of cigarettes.
Filter cigarettes, low tar cigarettes.  You can't go to
the store today and find a cigarette that says light or low
tar.  Can't be done.  Gone.  FDA said gone.  Gone.  So if
you didn't like that, gone.
You don't need to award punitive damages to deter
Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds from saying these are light
cigarettes or low tar cigarettes.  They don't exist
anymore.  Don't exist.  So if you didn't like that, gone.
Gone.  And gone for good.
So when you're thinking about this five-times formula,
the Court is telling you, you know what, that's not the
right way to go about doing this, just to come up with a
multiplication table.  It says you are to consider in
mitigating the behavior of each defendant and whether there
is a continuing need to punish and/or deter.
Now, you got to ask yourself, if the companies made a
   147
 1
turnaround in 1999 and said, you know what, smoking causes
 2
lung cancer, smoking causes a whole host of other diseases,
 3
they set up websites and informed the American public,
 4
stopped advertising, did all these changes.  And they're
 5
all new and different people.  You have to ask yourself --
 6
and it comes from my old farming background -- if the mule
 7
is headed in the right direction, do you really need to
 8
whup it again?  I mean, you got to ask yourself that.
 9
That's what the Court is telling you on page 2 of these
instructions.
Now, you've decided that punitive damages are
warranted.  And I noticed that -- and of course you set
that amount.  There's no question about that.  You reduced
the $6 million that you awarded to Mrs. Searcy by
40 percent.  She has been made whole by your award.  That's
what you did.  You fully compensated her for her loss.  And
you determined what her percentage -- or what Mrs. LaSard's
percentage of responsibility was.
But instead of simply multiplying -- 
MS. BARNETT:  Your Honor, I object to the
misstatement of the law.
THE COURT:  Overruled.
MR. REILLY:  Instead of merely -- we're dividing
our time so you can say -- instead of multiplying, really
multiplying five times six, I'd suggest that you think
   148
 1
about, well, 40 percent of the 6 million that you awarded
 2
is 2.4 million.  Maybe that's a number that you should
 3
think about when you're considering whether or not there's
 4
a continuing need for punishment and/or deterrence.
 5
I couldn't tell you about that because it wasn't
 6
relevant in Phase I.  I would have loved to have told you
 7
about that.  I think you would have had a different idea
 8
about Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds of today.  I think
 9
you would have.  But it wasn't relevant yet.  It is now.
And so in order to give Mr. Geise a little time, I'm
going to sit down.  But I would ask you to think about what
I've just told you and the changes -- you could go down to
the -- you could go down and knock on the door at Philip
Morris or R.J. Reynolds and say, "Hey, I want to talk to
all those guys whose videos I saw."  They're all dead and
gone.
Thanks.


MR. GEISE:  Counsel, Ms. Searcy, Ladies and
Gentlemen, I told you the last two times I talked to you I
would be brief, but I'm going to be very brief.  I'm going
to start out the same way I did before and that's by
thanking you.  I'm obviously disappointed with the verdict.
My client is disappointed with the verdict.  But we
   149
 1
understand and we respect you and we know you take your job
 2
seriously.
 3
I'm just going to hit a couple things real quickly from
 4
Mr. Reilly said.
 5
You know, I wish I could ask you what is it that made
 6
you check "yes" to that box that sent us to this phase?
 7
What was it?  Maybe I could respond to that.  But I don't
 8
get that opportunity.
 9
I'm going to guess a couple of things.  If -- if
something upset you about secret documents or formerly
secret documents or documents that weren't out there for
the public, that's a thing of the past.  Dr. Cummings told
you there are 60 million pages of documents available
online.  So if tonight you want to look into what
Dr. Teague said or you want to look at what Dr. Rodgman
said, Judge Moore discharges you, you can go home, log onto
rjrtdocs.com, look at every document.  They're all there
online.
The denial of risks and addictiveness, you heard from
Dr. Gentry.  You heard from Mr. Reilly.  R.J. Reynolds and
Philip Morris don't say that anymore.  Smoking causes
cancer.  Of course it's addictive.  They tell you if you
have a question, rely on what the public health community
is telling you, rely on the Surgeon General's reports.
When you go to the website, there's a link to those reports
   150
 1
to look at.
 2
Dr. Gentry's testimony by videotape, he told you
 3
Reynolds is working with the regulators.  They're trying to
 4
gain their respect.  They're trying to gain their trust.
 5
And they're working with them.  They know there's something
 6
there, but they're working to do it.
 7
I submit that what it was that caused you to check that
 8
box to say "yes" were events that took place in the '50s or
 9
the '60s or the '70s or the '80s.  They are events that
took place in the 20th century.
In this century, Reynolds admits smoking causes cancer,
and the documents are all there for you to see.  So the
Reynolds of this century asks you to continue to do your
job and to be fair and to be just and request that there's
no need to deter that changed attitude, there's no need to
deter what they're doing now.
And thank you again.  This will be last time I speak to
you.  And thank you for your service.
