 2                   MR. BELASIC:  Good afternoon, ladies and
 3             gentlemen.
 4                   Mr. Skolnick wasn't fooled.  He was a
 5             strong and intelligent man who made his own
 6             decisions about the use of a legal product.
 7                   Mr. Skolnick wasn't fooled.  His daughter
 8             Barbara took the stand and swore under oath
 9             that in 1964, she told him the Surgeon General
10             had concluded that smoking caused cancer, and
11             she said that there was no doubt -- no doubt in
12             her mind that he believed it.
13                   Mr. Skolnick wasn't fooled.
14                   His own wife testified that during the
15             periods of time from the '64 Surgeon General's
16             report, when she had discussions with him, he
17             would tell her that he was trying to quit.
18                   And she told me on the stand that he was
19             trying to quit because he believed that smoking
20             was dangerous.
21                   Their own expert, Dr. Proctor, said that
22             when Mr. Skolnick grew up, it was mandatory,
23             state law, to teach the school children in the
24             New York public school systems that he attended
25             that smoking was dangerous.

 1                   And, ladies and gentlemen, that went back
 2             as far as 1899.  And Dr. Proctor agreed that
 3             that was New York law.
 4                   Mr. Skolnick wasn't incapable of
 5             quitting, despite the suggestions.  His own
 6             experts, Dr. Cummings, the first expert they
 7             put up for you on video, Dr. Burns said that he
 8             was capable and that every smoker was capable
 9             of quitting if they made a serious, persistent
10             and motivated choice to do so.
11                   Mr. Skolnick wasn't deprived of his
12             choice.  His own experts said repeatedly that
13             everyone, and again including Mr. Skolnick,
14             have a choice to quit.
15                   And Mr. Skolnick wasn't somehow rendered
16             non-responsible, irresponsible.  He was
17             responsible.
18                   And Dr. Burns, on the stand, said that
19             whether or not you call Mr. Skolnick addicted,
20             whether we call it a habit, a dependency,
21             Dr. Burns, his own expert, said that
22             Mr. Skolnick was responsible for his smoking
23             behavior.
24                   That's all of their experts, ladies and
25             gentlemen.  That's all of their witnesses.

 1                   Mr. Skolnick wasn't fooled.
 2                   Now, a lot of what you heard this morning
 3             I think in some way explains why we spent so
 4             much time here on this trial.
 5                   A lot of what you heard this morning was
 6             evidence about advertisements for brands that
 7             Mr. Skolnick never smoked, statements by
 8             tobacco companies that there is no evidence
 9             that he saw, conduct that they claim by tobacco
10             companies, some of them not even defendants
11             here, that there is no evidence linking to
12             Mr. Skolnick.
13                   We're not here to retry the Engle class
14             action.  When you see the verdict form, you
15             won't be asked any questions:  Did the tobacco
16             companies do something about advertising to
17             youth?  Did the tobacco companies conceal
18             something?  Did the tobacco companies do
19             something wrong?
20                   When you go through the verdict form, the
21             questions are about Mr. Skolnick, because this
22             is an individual lawsuit.
23                   The claim here is brought by
24             Mrs. Skolnick, and the only smoker, the only
25             smoker that matters in this case is

 1             Mr. Skolnick.  Not the Engle issues and all the
 2             other things that they're trying to talk about.
 3                   The questions you're going to decide is
 4             Mr. Skolnick and why did Mr. Skolnick die.
 5                   There's four key points that I think I
 6             would like to remind you when we go through the
 7             verdict form and what it is that you're going
 8             to have to decide.  On these key points,
 9             there's either no dispute or the evidence is
10             overwhelming.
11                   And the first is that Mr. Skolnick was
12             aware of the risks of smoking since at least
13             1964.
14                   And I'm going to cover the testimony of
15             his family members, the testimony of his
16             expert.  And when you consider that testimony,
17             remember it doesn't come from a tobacco company
18             witness.  It comes from his own family.
19                   It comes from the people who loved him,
20             or it comes from the experts that they hired
21             and paid -- yes, as you heard, their experts
22             have made more than $2 1/2 million in the last
23             20 years, or Dr. Proctor who made $100,000 in
24             the last month and $800,000 in the last three
25             years.

 1                   So make no mistake about it, that
 2             evidence comes from either the family members
 3             who loved him and the experts that were paid to
 4             testify on his behalf.
 5                   But, secondly, Mr. Skolnick was capable
 6             of quitting.  His experts admit it.  But only
 7             tried to cut down.  And, of course, you heard a
 8             lot of testimony.  Well, he was always trying
 9             to quit.  That's what Mrs. Skolnick says.
10                   I'm going to go through the evidence and
11             look at what he did, and see if we can judge
12             and see what Mr. Skolnick actually did, rather
13             than what Mrs. Skolnick says that he said.
14                   Third, Mr. Skolnick caused his own
15             injury.  You're going to see in the jury
16             instructions that Judge Crow instructs you that
17             in this case, the plaintiff says that
18             Mr. Skolnick's actions were a partial cause of
19             his own injury.
20                   The evidence is going to be undisputed
21             that he could have avoided his injury.  If, in
22             fact, he had primary lung cancer, we concede
23             that.  If it was lung cancer caused by smoking,
24             then his own experts said he could have quit.
25             And if he had quit 15 years earlier, he would

 1             not have gotten lung cancer.  That's their
 2             expert.
 3                   Finally, I think we know by now, in the
 4             radiation lawsuit, Mrs. Skolnick claimed that
 5             the Sylvania plant had caused Mr. Skolnick's
 6             lung cancer and had caused her husband's death.
 7                   Let's look at the evidence on was
 8             Mr. Skolnick fooled.
 9                   In '64, both Barbara Skolnick and
10             Mrs. Skolnick said that Mr. Skolnick heard
11             about the Surgeon General's report.  They both
12             had conversations with him.  Mrs. Skolnick said
13             she discussed the health risks of smoking.  She
14             asked him to quit.  There's no dispute about
15             this.
16                   But look at what he said in response.  He
17             said he would try.
18                   This was 1964.  It was 30 years before he
19             died.  He did not respond to her:  I don't
20             believe the Surgeon General's report, I saw
21             something on the news.  That's the plaintiff's
22             argument.  That's what they want you to
23             believe.
24                   Mrs. Skolnick said that his response to
25             her was he would try.

 1                   Well, if he had been tricked, if he
 2             didn't think that smoking caused lung cancer 30
 3             years earlier, why would he be trying to quit?
 4                   When I asked Mrs. Skolnick that, she
 5             admitted that the reason he was trying to quit,
 6             and she says it was a lot, and we'll look at
 7             that evidence, but the reason he was trying to
 8             quit is that he believed that smoking was
 9             dangerous.
10                   Well, it wasn't just Mrs. Skolnick,
11             because their daughter Barbara was more
12             emphatic.  She got up there and she testified
13             that, again, she raised the issue of the 1964
14             Surgeon General's report.
15                   And I asked her specifically if there was
16             any doubt, did she have any doubt that he
17             accepted the warning from that report?
18                   And remember, that report didn't just say
19             that smoking might be hazardous or smoking
20             might be dangerous.  When the report came out
21             in '64, it says:  Smoking causes lung cancer.
22                   And now, almost 50 years later, we're
23             debating whether or not this man was fooled?
24             His own daughter says he -- no doubt he knew 50
25             years ago that it could cause lung cancer.

 1                   She also said no doubt he believed that
 2             smoking could be dangerous to his health.
 3                   And because we know that the plaintiff's
 4             lawyers have been making these arguments that
 5             he was misled or he heard some unidentified
 6             statement on the news, I asked her what the
 7             response was.  You know.  And he didn't
 8             respond, Oh, I don't believe it because I heard
 9             the tobacco companies.
10                   No, he told her he would try to quit, or
11             try to cut down, as he told so many of his
12             loved ones when they warned him.
13                   We know, again, two years later, then the
14             package warning came out on every pack of
15             cigarettes.  And, once again, his daughter had
16             the conversation with him.  She told him about
17             the health risks.
18                   This is two years after she had told us
19             that he already believed that smoking could
20             cause lung cancer.
21                   And remember this testimony?  She
22             actually said:  Here it is in black and white,
23             holding the pack.  The tobacco companies are
24             telling you it is detrimental to your health,
25             and you need to stop.

 1                    Let me ask you this.  If it was true, if
 2             it was true that Mr. Skolnick had been tricked,
 3             cheated, deceived, if he actually believed in
 4             the middle of the '60s something that some man
 5             on television said or something from a tobacco
 6             company said, don't you think he would have
 7             told his daughter, Well, the tobacco companies
 8             aren't telling me it's detrimental to my
 9             health.  I think they're telling me it's safe.
10             I'm not going to quit.
11                   I asked her that, did he say that?
12                   Of course, no, he did not.
13                   He said, I'm trying to quit.
14                   She told him the tobacco companies are
15             telling you it's dangerous.  She said there's
16             no doubt in her mind that he believed the
17             Surgeon General.
18                   Now, we've all heard many times that two
19             years later, in 1968, Mrs. Skolnick decided to
20             change her life and change her smoking.  She'd
21             been smoking for 26 years.  She said she was
22             smoking a pack a day.  She was smoking the same
23             exact brand as her husband.  She wasn't some
24             occasional smoker; 26 years, a pack a day at
25             that point, the same exact cigarettes.

 1                   Whatever was in those cigarettes that
 2             they want you to imagine, it was going into
 3             Mrs. Skolnick.  She made the choice.
 4                   We know what happened.  He wouldn't even
 5             watch the TV show with her.  We know he didn't
 6             choose to quit.  We know he choose to continue.
 7             He wouldn't even watch the TV show.
 8                   And you'll be instructed, obviously
 9             you're the judges of the facts, you use your
10             common sense, your intelligence, your
11             experience.  If he actually wanted to quit
12             smoking, don't you think he would have sat on
13             the couch for an hour with his wife?
14                   Does it make sense that he really wanted
15             to quit, but their story is, well, he thought
16             he would cut down a little at a time?
17                   Thirty years later, he still hadn't cut
18             down.  He's always telling people, I'm going to
19             cut down.
20                   Does it make sense?  Did he really want
21             to quit?  Or did he choose to continue?
22                   He made a different choice than his wife.
23                   We know she chose to quit, we know she
24             chose to follow through.  She watched all five
25             episodes, and at the end of that she was a

 1             nonsmoker, and she never smoked again.
 2                   And for 25 years, from 1968 until 1993
 3             when Mr. Skolnick passed away, he had a living,
 4             breathing example of a nonsmoker.  And you know
 5             what?  She said that not once did he ever ask
 6             her, How did you quit, honey?  How did you
 7             quit?
 8                   Does that make sense if he really wanted
 9             to?  If you wanted to change your life
10             dramatically and your own spouse had done so,
11             if you really wanted to, don't you think you
12             would have asked even once, how did you do it?
13                   He chose not to quit.  He made a
14             different choice than her.
15                   At the same time, Mrs. Skolnick said in
16             1968 that she knew cigarettes were addictive.
17             This is 20 years before the Surgeon General's
18             report changed the definition of cigarettes
19             from habit to addictive, 20 years before.
20                   She got the same information her husband
21             did.  They weren't fooled.  Not just
22             Mr. Skolnick.  She wasn't fooled.  He wasn't
23             fooled.
24                   Now, we know that by the mid 1970s, her
25             husband had stopped smoking in the car.

 1                   And remember when Dr. Burns came?
 2             Dr. Burns, obviously he never met Mr. Skolnick,
 3             but he read all of the deposition testimony
 4             from Mrs. Skolnick, from Barbara, from the son
 5             Robert, from Amy Skolnick, the daughter-in-law.
 6             He read all of that.
 7                   And he agreed that by the mid '70s she
 8             had stopped, and he agreed that Mrs. Skolnick
 9             reported that the reason -- the reason her
10             husband (sic) stopped smoking in the mid '70s
11             was because everybody knew how bad it was.
12             Everybody knew how bad it was.  There wasn't
13             any doubt that he knew smoking was bad.
14                   Now, I've got to be fair here.  Do you
15             remember Dr. Burns speculated maybe they were
16             just talking about secondhand smoke?  Maybe
17             they meant secondhand smoke was bad and
18             everyone knew that.
19                   Imagine if that was true.  If it was true
20             in the mid '70s, that Mr. Skolnick thought
21             secondhand smoke was so bad that they couldn't
22             even be around it, well, isn't it obvious that
23             he knew smoking was bad for him.  Even if you
24             accept that rank speculation from Dr. Burns.
25                   And remember, this is ten years after

 1             their daughter swears under oath that there is
 2             no doubt that her father believed the Surgeon
 3             General's report on lung cancer.
 4                   We know that also his son Robert warned
 5             him repeatedly.  We saw that, and Dr. Burns
 6             agreed.
 7                   We know Robert the attorney, he did not
 8             testify, but he testified under oath at a
 9             deposition.  Dr. Burns agrees that Robert
10             warned Mr. Skolnick about the risks of smoking
11             and asked him to quit all throughout the 1970s.
12                   And this is the way Dr. Burns put it.  He
13             used a little more formal language than I did.
14             He said that Robert consistently provided a
15             message to Mr. Skolnick to quit.
16                   So it was coming at all directions, from
17             the people he loved the most, from the people
18             he trusted the most.
19                   And those people, including his daughter,
20             report that he wasn't fooled; that he wasn't
21             saying, I think smoking is safe because
22             somebody said something on TV.
23                   Under oath, they testified that he
24             believed it was dangerous.  And we know, as we
25             heard before, that Mr. Skolnick was told that

 1             his sister Sunny had died from lung cancer.
 2                   I heard Mr. Schlesinger say, well, he
 3             probably would have disputed that.
 4                   That's not really the issue.  No one in
 5             this room knows whether she died of lung cancer
 6             or not, but it's undisputed that's what
 7             Mr. Skolnick was told.  That's what
 8             Mrs. Skolnick said.  That's what Dr. Burns
 9             said.
10                   He was told his own sister had died of
11             lung cancer from smoking.
12                   And when I asked Dr. Burns how big a
13             proof is that, the emotional factor of seeing
14             in real life, Dr. Burns said that it was
15             virtually irrefutable, irrefutable
16             demonstration to Mr. Skolnick that smoking
17             causes lung cancer.
18                   So this is their expert, this is the
19             gentleman that they picked to come in and give
20             an opinion on addiction, and he admits in 1978,
21             basically no doubt, irrefutable that
22             Mr. Skolnick knew that smoking causes lung
23             cancer.  That's the same thing his daughter
24             said way back in the '60s.
25                   Now, you heard a lot of different themes

 1             in plaintiff's counsel's argument, and we heard
 2             a lot of different themes and messages about
 3             what the issues in this case are.
 4                   And I would submit to you that those
 5             messages from the plaintiff, from the
 6             plaintiff's witnesses, from the plaintiff's
 7             attorneys have been contradictory.
 8                   One of their arguments here is that
 9             Mr. Skolnick did not appreciate the risks
10             because of something a tobacco company said.
11                   And the only evidence of that is
12             Mrs. Skolnick said at some time she was sure
13             they were watching a news item where some
14             tobacco company person was testifying, and it
15             was on TV.
16                   But yet when I asked Mrs. Skolnick, how
17             can you say he tried to quit all the time, she
18             said:  Well, he tried to quit all the time
19             because he thought smoking was dangerous.
20                   They can't have it both ways.  Either
21             Mr. Skolnick wanted to quit all the time
22             because he thought smoking was dangerous, or he
23             had been somehow tricked, and in which case he
24             wouldn't want to quit.
25                   But they're trying to have it both ways,

 1             and it's simply contradictory.
 2                   Now, at times they've suggested he could
 3             not quit because of the effects of nicotine,
 4             and even today we saw that.
 5                   Even today when Mr. Hammer was talking
 6             about we take a certain percentage of fault,
 7             and he said that Mr. Skolnick was only 20
 8             percent responsible for 50 years of choices
 9             about smoking.  He actually used the phrase
10             because of his "inability to quit."  And a
11             minute later, he was saying of course he could
12             quit.
13                   It's contradictory.  Either he could quit
14             or he could not quit.
15                   Their experts say he could quit.  Their
16             admission and Judge Crow's jury instructions
17             tell you that they admit that he caused his own
18             injury in part because of his failure to quit.
19                   He could have quit, and he caused his own
20             injury.  And, again, that's not something a
21             tobacco company is saying.  That's what the
22             plaintiffs admitted in this lawsuit.  That's
23             what Judge Crow was instructing you.
24                   Now, we know the biggest contradiction,
25             and you've seen it from the very first five

 1             minutes of opening statement when I showed you
 2             that Sylvania case.  You hadn't heard anything
 3             about the fact that Mrs. Skolnick said that her
 4             husband had been killed by toxic exposures,
 5             radiation, from the Skolnick plant (sic).  From
 6             the very beginning, you saw that.
 7                   She did claim in this case that smoking
 8             caused lung cancer and death.  But she claimed
 9             years before in another lawsuit that it was
10             radiation that killed him.  And that is an
11             inherent contradiction.
12                   We're going to go through that, and I'll
13             address what Mr. Schlesinger said about it.
14                   Well, it's not just the contradictions
15             and themes.  Mrs. Skolnick's testimony is the
16             opposite of her own daughter.  She says at one
17             point that her husband relied on unidentified
18             statements.  I asked her when they were, are
19             you sure you're not thinking about the 1994
20             testimony, which obviously would be after her
21             husband had passed away.
22                   She said no, she was sure it was at some
23             point -- she couldn't even state the decade.
24             She said she just heard it was sometime after
25             the Surgeon General's report.

 1                   But when we asked Barbara, what did your
 2             father think about the Surgeon General's
 3             report, she said there's no doubt, no doubt
 4             that he believed it.
 5                   Mrs. Skolnick says he experienced
 6             withdrawal symptoms, although you heard the
 7             withdrawal symptoms.  She said she was edgy and
 8             fidgety.  That's not the kind of withdrawal
 9             symptoms we typically think of as interfering
10             with an ability to function.
11                   Yes, I suppose you would not want to be
12             fidgety or edgy, not the kind of serious
13             withdrawal symptoms that their experts talked
14             about.
15                   But when we asked Barbara under oath, she
16             said she doesn't remember her father having any
17             withdrawal symptoms.
18                   Now, why would Barbara, who knew him --
19             she was born in 1950, she was able to observe
20             him throughout the '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s,
21             why would Barbara say something under oath
22             that's the exact opposite?
23                   You'll have to make that decision.
24                   Mrs. Skolnick even contradicts herself.
25             We know she says he relied on some unidentified

 1             statements.  But you saw and you'll remember
 2             this was the point when I was cross-examining
 3             her, and I had to put up about two pages of her
 4             prior testimony that she gave under oath in
 5             this lawsuit.
 6                   And in there, she described how she told
 7             Mr. Skolnick that the Surgeon General was
 8             right, the tobacco companies were wrong.  And
 9             Mr. Skolnick, he didn't tell her, Honey, I
10             think the tobacco companies, you know, that I
11             think it's safe or I'm being misled.  No.  He
12             said he would quit.
13                   She's contradicting herself even in the
14             same hour when she was on the stand.
15                   Mrs. Skolnick's -- her testimony about
16             filters was contradicted by her own expert.
17             She said repeatedly that they -- meaning, she
18             and Mr. Skolnick -- switched to filtered
19             cigarettes as soon as they came out, she said.
20             As soon as they came out.
21                   Dr. Proctor explained how that isn't
22             true.  He said filters came out in the early
23             '50s, and Mrs. Skolnick said the very first
24             time they smoked filters was Pall Mall.  And
25             Pall Mall didn't even have a filter until 1966.

 1                   So for almost 15 years these filters were
 2             out, these filters and the statements that they
 3             say are somehow tricking them, they weren't
 4             smoking them.
 5                   And what she said, her own expert says
 6             wasn't true.
 7                   She says that they thought they were
 8             safer.  When we asked her why did you think
 9             they were safer, who said what?  Did a tobacco
10             company say something?  Was there actually an
11             advertisement for Pall Malls that told you they
12             were safer?  She doesn't know, she can't
13             identify anything.
14                   And then we asked Dr. Proctor.  I put up
15             all the Pall Mall advertisements, including in
16             the years before they switched to filters, and
17             those were the ones that said long on taste,
18             mild.  Long on taste, mild.
19                   And he agreed that those ads never said
20             filters were safer.  Because when the filter
21             came out, it was the same statement.
22                   And he said -- this was his description,
23             his word.  Honest.  He actually used the word
24             "honest" to describe a tobacco company.  He
25             said American Tobacco Company was honest about

 1             filters.
 2                   Now we know that Mrs. Skolnick has
 3             contradicted herself.  She told us under oath
 4             that she wasn't suing for radiation, when she
 5             sued Verizon and the Sylvania plant.  She told
 6             us under oath that she was only suing for colon
 7             cancer.
 8                   And then we saw her own wrongful death
 9             claim.  He didn't die from the colon cancer.
10             She's claiming he died from lung cancer.  And
11             her claim in that case was wrongful death from
12             lung cancer.  We saw that in her own
13             handwriting, sworn and under perjury.
14                   Here's what we saw.  This is her verified
15             declaration for allocation of settlement
16             proceeds in the radiation lawsuit.
17                   There's who she's suing, Verizon is now
18             one of the owners of that radioactive site.
19                   Look at what she brought.  This is not a
20             claim for colon cancer that was cured through
21             surgery in 1980.  This is a claim for wrongful
22             death.  The specifics of the claim.  She has to
23             know when she's filling this out that her
24             claim, as she writes, is for lung cancer.
25                   We know that she knew it was a wrongful

 1             death claim.  It was literally on the inch
 2             above where she signed.  We know that she swore
 3             and said that under penalty of perjury that she
 4             read the foregoing; that the same was true to
 5             her knowledge.  She swore it was true under
 6             penalty of perjury.
 7                   You know, Mr. Schlesinger said -- he went
 8             through the same things I did, and he said,
 9             hey, that was true, that was true, that was
10             true.
11                   Well, of course, we're not claiming it
12             wasn't true.  What is true is that three years
13             before she brought this lawsuit claiming
14             smoking killed her husband, she had already
15             sued corporations saying they killed her
16             husband.  Although she wasn't saying smoking
17             was the cause.  She was saying radiation was
18             the cause.
19                   So no one is disputing that she was
20             writing down here what she thought was true.
21             This is proof that what she's saying now, it
22             was only colon cancer, I never knew it was a
23             wrongful death claim.
24                   With all due respect, this is proof that
25             what she said simply isn't credible.

 1                   Once again, it says the specifics of the
 2             claim.  Notice what it instructs her.  The
 3             first words in the instruction:  For the
 4             claimed injury, she writes lung cancer.  That's
 5             what she was suing for.  Even though she says
 6             under oath now, that's not what I was suing
 7             for.
 8                   Same thing again.  Give us the specifics
 9             of the claim.  She talks about death from lung
10             cancer.
11                   Now, look, I'm not going to say -- I'm
12             not going to talk about corrupt motives or say
13             all the other bad things that Mr. Schlesinger
14             said about Dr. McGregor.
15                   You're going to decide.  And I know that
16             Mrs. Skolnick is 86.  I know her husband passed
17             around 20 years ago.  From everything we've
18             seen, her husband sounds like a wonderful man,
19             and she deserves to be treated with respect.  I
20             think I did.
21                   But with all due respect, you can
22             conclude from this evidence that Mrs. Skolnick
23             has simply not been credible about her prior
24             lawsuit; that she took a position that was
25             beneficial to her in that lawsuit, suing for

 1             money, saying radiation was the cause, and now
 2             she's taken that position here.
 3                   And we've seen that her testimony, not
 4             just on radiation, her testimony on smoking,
 5             contradicted by her own daughter, contradicted
 6             by her own experts.  Sometimes even
 7             contradicting herself in the same session on
 8             the stand.
 9                   And I would submit to you that, again,
10             with all due respect -- and we have sympathy
11             for her.  But you've agreed to put aside the
12             sympathy that you have for her.
13                   But her testimony simply doesn't add up.
14             And it's contradicted by what we now know are
15             facts.
16                   So we know that Mr. Skolnick was aware of
17             the risks for at least 30 years, and he was
18             capable of quitting and tried to cut down.
19                   We know the plaintiffs have agreed that
20             at least in part, they've admitted that he
21             caused his own injury.
22                   Let's look at the verdict form.  This is
23             going to be what your -- the actual verdict
24             form you're going to decide.
25                   Here is the first question.  And even

 1             though it's one question, it really is three
 2             different parts.
 3                   Was Mr. Skolnick addicted to cigarettes
 4             containing nicotine?  And if he was, was such
 5             addiction a legal cause of his lung cancer and
 6             death?
 7                   And of those three issues, first we know
 8             the plaintiff has to prove that he has lung
 9             cancer.
10                   Their experts agree that if it was lung
11             cancer that spread from somewhere else, then
12             it's not caused by smoking.
13                   Their experts agree if it's spread on the
14             colon, no one claims that that was -- that that
15             was caused by smoking.
16                   It's their burden to show that he
17             actually had this primary lung cancer caused by
18             smoking.
19                   Of course as Mr. Schlesinger said, they
20             also have to prove that he was addicted.
21                   This is the most important part, and that
22             is what you didn't hear from the plaintiff's
23             lawyer.  They have to show not just that
24             smoking caused his cancer, but that
25             addiction -- that addiction was the legal cause

 1             of his lung cancer and death.
 2                   Now, whatever definition you use, was his
 3             addiction an actual cause, apart from his
 4             choice to smoke for those years?
 5                   Here's their burden of proof.  We know
 6             that plaintiffs have the burden of proof on
 7             each of those issues.  They're going to need to
 8             prove that smoking medically caused a primary
 9             lung cancer.
10                   They have to prove it was addiction.  And
11             then the third point, they have to prove that
12             addiction was a legal cause.
13                   And I'm just going to briefly review some
14             of the evidence on this medical causation.
15                   Mr. Lombardi is going to talk about
16             radiation, and he's going to address that and
17             what Dr. McGregor actually said.
18                   But let's just briefly talk about.  They
19             brought in two doctors that treated him.  What
20             they didn't bring in was the doctor,
21             Dr. Rosenthal, the gastroenterologist.  Because
22             he's the man, he's the doctor who treated him
23             for colon cancer.  You didn't see him testify.
24             We just have his records.
25                   The other two doctors, pulmonologist and

 1             radiologist, are doctors who are trying to
 2             remember something that happened 20 years ago
 3             by looking at whatever is on their medical
 4             records.
 5                   You have to decide, was it primary lung
 6             cancer?  Did it spread from the colon?
 7                   We know Dr. McGregor has already said
 8             that radiation caused the colon cancer.  And
 9             now Mrs. Skolnick, now her new position is she
10             was only suing for colon cancer in the Verizon
11             case.  If that was true, then even
12             Mrs. Skolnick would have agreed that radiation
13             caused it.
14                   We know that everyone agrees it wasn't
15             caused by smoking.  But it was the same cell
16             type as the tumor they found in his lung.
17                   Now Dr. McGregor says that that colon
18             cancer, the colon cancer that may have spread,
19             was caused by radiation.  If colon cancer
20             spreads, where does it go?
21                   We asked their experts.  We didn't bring
22             in someone.  We asked their experts.  Where
23             would it spread?
24                   Dr. Burns said it spreads to other of the
25             major organs, but the two most common are the

 1             liver and the lungs.  And Dr. Burns, their
 2             expert, specifically said that it goes first to
 3             the liver on the way to the lungs.
 4                   So just common sense, if you wanted to
 5             know, is there a possibility that colon cancer
 6             spread to the lung?  After what we learned from
 7             Dr. Burns, you would want to know, well, did he
 8             have a tumor in his liver?
 9                   Well, here is what we found.  They did
10             the radiology.  They found at least three
11             hepatic masses.  Their doctors agree hepatic is
12             the liver.  There were three masses in his
13             liver.  Two of them measured approximately two
14             centimeters.  Two centimeters is about
15             three-quarters of an inch.  That's two of those
16             tumors and a third one.
17                   They say specifically -- and again, no
18             tobacco company made this up.  These are his
19             actual records.
20                   They say these three masses in the liver
21             could have been missed.  And, of course, they
22             never biopsied them.  No one went to find out
23             if those were cancerous.  Never biopsied.
24                   They put Dr. Davis on.  Dr. Davis isn't
25             an expert on colon cancer.  But we asked him

 1             about this.  One of the lesions was on the CT
 2             scan, and one of the reports said it could have
 3             been missed.
 4                   And then Dennis Murphy asked him.  That's
 5             not uncommon that testing done on a patient
 6             might miss a lesion on a mass.  And Dr. Barry
 7             Davis -- and this is the doctor they picked out
 8             of all his doctors to come in -- said it can,
 9             it can be missed.
10                   We're not making it up.  It's on the
11             medical record.  And no one went, no one went
12             to check if those three large masses in his
13             lung were cancer.
14                   The second thing you're going to have to
15             decide and then the third thing are related.
16                   Plaintiffs like to argue -- all you have
17             to decide was, was he addicted.  Come on, he
18             smoked 30 years, he smoked a lot.  Common
19             sense, he must be addicted.  That's what
20             plaintiffs tell you is the position.
21                   But we know, and you'll see on the
22             verdict form, that they also have to prove that
23             addiction, not just smoking, that addiction was
24             the legal cause of his death.
25                   Let's look at the evidence on both.

 1             First of all, Mr. Skolnick enjoyed smoking.  I
 2             don't know if anyone else found it surprising
 3             that the witnesses weren't asked that.
 4                   But Sylvia Gross did.  And remember,
 5             Sylvia Gross was a woman around Mrs. Skolnick's
 6             age, one of the Skolnicks' close friends.  And
 7             she said without question, he enjoyed smoking.
 8                   None of the other family members were
 9             asked.  Could he really have smoked 40 or 50
10             years and not enjoyed it?  Could he have smoked
11             after meals and not enjoyed it?  Did he not
12             enjoy it?
13                   Well, the only person not tied to this
14             family when asked that question immediately
15             said, sure, he enjoyed smoking.  That's one of
16             the reasons he smoked.
17                   Now, on addiction, Dr. Burns, their
18             expert, admitted there is no consensus
19             definition.  There isn't some checklist or some
20             criteria that you can use.
21                   We know there's evidence he enjoyed
22             smoking.  There's evidence from Barbara that he
23             smoked to relieve stress.  She said that one of
24             the reasons that meditation -- that he was
25             interested in meditation was that in general he

 1             wanted to relax more, wanted to reduce stress.
 2                   We know from Barbara that he had no real
 3             withdrawal symptoms, the kind of symptoms that
 4             an addict, that a drug addict, as
 5             Mr. Schlesinger says, that a drug addict would
 6             have.
 7                   And we know this.  None of his doctors
 8             diagnosed addiction.
 9                   Think of all the medical records that you
10             saw and all the different doctors, and they
11             only called two.  But none of those medical
12             records said the patient is addicted.  Patient
13             is nicotine dependent.  None of them did.
14                   Now, Dr. Barry Davis came in and said he
15             doesn't remember him.  But he said 20 years
16             after the fact he would say that.  But while
17             they were seeing him, there isn't any evidence
18             that his doctors actually diagnosed addiction.
19                   And as we're going to see, the evidence
20             is that it was actually his choice to smoke and
21             not stop.  It wasn't something that he was
22             being compelled by nicotine.
23                   The Judge will instruct you and you can
24             see when you go to the section on legal cause,
25             what is legal cause?  Does it mean it's legal

 1             to cause something?
 2                   No, legal cause means that something
 3             directly and in a continuous sequence
 4             contributes substantially to a result.
 5                   So if you were arguing he was addicted,
 6             whatever definition they're going to use -- and
 7             I haven't seen one yet -- but if you're arguing
 8             that he was addicted and you wanted to know if
 9             it caused lung cancer, you would have to ask,
10             did it directly cause it?  Was it in a
11             continuous sequence?  And did it contribute
12             substantially?
13                   Let's look at the evidence on that.
14                   First of all, how can addiction be a
15             direct cause when you admit that the smoker can
16             quit and avoid his injury?
17                   They are saying addiction caused his lung
18             cancer.  But their experts on addiction say
19             addiction doesn't mean you can't quit.  You can
20             still quit.
21                   How is addiction a direct cause when a
22             person can stop and not get the injury that
23             they claim addiction caused?  It's not a cause
24             when a smoker has the ability to quit or a
25             choice to quit.

 1                   And when we asked Dr. Burns and
 2             Dr. Cummings, their experts, they agree that
 3             it's up to the smoker to choose the quit, and
 4             that the smoker is responsible.
 5                   You know the old line that no one put a
 6             gun to his head -- and that seems like an
 7             extreme example.  But in this case, it's true.
 8             Because his experts say he could still quit.
 9                   And I don't -- is there any way that
10             someone can say you caused an injury to a
11             person when that person has the ability to make
12             a choice, and if they make it -- if they make
13             that choice, they can walk away and not be
14             injured.
15                   And this is separate from the issue of
16             whether smoking's the cause.  The judge is
17             instructing you, the verdict form is
18             instructing you.  You have to find that
19             addiction is a cause.
20                   Here's the instruction you're going to
21             get.  And this is the Court -- Judge Crow
22             telling you that in this regard, plaintiff has
23             admitted that the acts of Leo Skolnick relating
24             to the duration and frequency of his efforts to
25             quit smoking -- so the duration and frequency,

 1             how long and how often -- were a partial legal
 2             cause of his injuries and death.
 3                   And, of course, the plaintiffs, they
 4             don't want to take full responsibility.  They
 5             want to say it's also the fault of defendants.
 6                   But think of that.  The plaintiffs are
 7             admitting that Mr. Skolnick caused his own lung
 8             cancer and death.  But they say, just in part.
 9                   What does this mean?  How could Leo
10             Skolnick, how could they admit that he caused
11             in part his own death?
12                   Well, it has to mean that Mr. Skolnick
13             knew that smoking was dangerous and continued
14             to smoke.  Because if he didn't know that,
15             would the plaintiffs have admitted that he was
16             a partial cause of his own death?
17                   And it has to mean that he had the
18             ability to quit.  Because if he couldn't quit,
19             how could the plaintiffs say that his actions
20             with regard to quitting were a cause of his own
21             injury?
22                   And we know his experts say, including
23             Dr. Burns, that Mr. Skolnick had the ability to
24             quit smoking at a time that would have
25             prevented his death.

 1                   Now, Mr. Skolnick wasn't someone who was
 2             in a car with no brakes or strapped to the
 3             wheel, hurdling down a highway where he
 4             couldn't escape and he was inevitably going to
 5             crash.
 6                   On this highway of smoking, their own
 7             experts, Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings, say that
 8             there are off-ramps, there are places where the
 9             smoker can stop.
10                   He had the choice and the ability to
11             quit, and that's from his own experts, not from
12             someone the tobacco company brought.  He had
13             the choice to quit.
14                   And Dr. Burns says he could have quit at
15             a time that would have prevented his injury.
16                   Given all that, how can you say, how can
17             plaintiffs say, well, addiction was a direct
18             cause of his injury?
19                   It just doesn't have to be a cause, it
20             has to be a direct cause.  Their own experts
21             say that Mr. Skolnick had the ability to choose
22             to break that chain at any time.
23                   Now I have this up here on the board, and
24             I have to admit this is really just a reminder
25             for me to point you to the board.  This board

 1             is sort of like a tree of choices.  I'm not
 2             going to go over them all again.  Obviously we
 3             don't know when he started smoking.  No one saw
 4             him.
 5                   Dr. Burns tried to say, well, if you look
 6             at the statistics, men in his age group started
 7             at a certain point.  I asked him a few
 8             questions about that.  But everyone agrees no
 9             one knows when he started with direct
10             knowledge.
11                   Nobody met him in this case before 1947,
12             when he was already 29.  But he had a choice.
13             He could become a regular smoker or don't
14             start.
15                   We know in '64 when the Surgeon General's
16             report came out, the first time he heard it, he
17             had a choice.
18                   The first time his daughter Barbara
19             warned him about lung cancer in '64, he had a
20             choice.
21                   The first time his wife told him about
22             the Surgeon General's report, and she asked him
23             to quit, he had a choice.
24                   Two years later when the warning came out
25             on the pack, he had that choice.

 1                   And when his daughter Barbara came to him
 2             with the warning and told him the tobacco
 3             companies are telling you it's bad, you need to
 4             stop, he had a choice again.
 5                   And two years later, when Mrs. Skolnick
 6             quit, he had that choice.
 7                   And in the '70s, when a different warning
 8             came out on every pack, he had a choice.
 9                   And in the mid '70s and mid '80s, when
10             even his own wife admits he knew it was
11             dangerous for him and when his son Robert was
12             warning him, according to Dr. Burns on a
13             consistent basis, he had a choice every one of
14             those times.
15                   And it's simply second-guessing now to
16             say he made the wrong choice, that he made the
17             wrong choice and as Mrs. Skolnick is now
18             saying, because her husband made a regrettable
19             choice, a choice that every one of us
20             sympathizes with, she now wants $9.1 million
21             for the choices he made year after year after
22             year after year.
23                   He wasn't a robot.  He wasn't a zombie.
24             According to his own experts, he had the
25             ability to quit.

 1                   I want to show you the flip chart.  This
 2             will just take a minute.  I think everybody
 3             remembers.
 4                   Dr. Burns said if you quit smoking, your
 5             risk of lung cancer goes down.  After a year,
 6             it goes down; after two years, it goes down
 7             more; after five and ten years, it goes way
 8             down.
 9                   And he said after 15 years, it goes down
10             enough that he could agree that if he would
11             have quit 15 years before he died, that more
12             likely than not he would not have developed
13             lung cancer.
14                   And that's the standard, the greater
15             weight of the evidence, more probable than not.
16             That's the standard in the court of law.
17             That's why I asked Dr. Burns that way.  He
18             says:  Mr. Skolnick quits 15 years, 1978, then
19             more likely than not he doesn't get lung
20             cancer.
21                   Well, if you look at the choice tree,
22             really every single day of his life he had that
23             choice.
24                   But look at all the different times that
25             the risk of lung cancer was put right in his

 1             face, was put directly to him by the people he
 2             loved, the people he trusted most in the world.
 3             He made those choices.
 4                   At any one of these times before 1978, he
 5             could have quit smoking.  That's what his own
 6             experts say.  And according to Dr. Burns, then
 7             he would not have gotten lung cancer.
 8                   Now, how can you say that addiction was a
 9             direct cause when you say at the same time
10             addiction didn't stop him from quitting, and if
11             he chose to quit, he doesn't get cancer.
12                   You can play a word game.  You can say
13             addiction means these things.  He smokes a lot.
14             He smokes in the morning.
15                   I could come up and say, well, I think
16             it's better to say it's a habit.  It's a
17             perpetual or continual behavior.
18                   Another person like Dr. Cummings might
19             say it's a dependency.  Let's look at the
20             psychiatric definition.  You can put whatever
21             label on it you want.
22                   But in the end, to show that addiction is
23             a direct cause, they have to show that it
24             directly -- hooked him into substantially and
25             continuously causing him to develop lung

 1             cancer.
 2                   But his experts don't say, oh, no, he was
 3             directly and continuously caused to develop
 4             lung cancer.  They admit that he could have
 5             quit.  They admit that he had a choice.
 6                   Dr. Cummings also agreed within 15 years,
 7             the risk of cancer disappears.
 8                   Mr. Schlesinger called it a -- he said
 9             this was my favorite number.  I suppose in a
10             tobacco case about whether people have to quit,
11             it might be.  Because the idea that 50 million
12             people can accomplish something and then to
13             just pooh-pooh that and say, well, this one man
14             whose wife just happens to be suing for
15             9 million, he could not.
16                   What makes more sense?  50 million people
17             have quit.  Some of their experts said 60
18             million.  It's the most common health behavior
19             that people do to improve.
20                   Dr. Cummings says it's been known
21             hundreds of years, and even the Surgeon General
22             has referred to it as personal choice.
23                   Dr. Cummings, who they put on by video,
24             said that the 50 million people who quit were
25             addicted; that more than half of the people who

 1             had ever smoked had already quit, and that
 2             addicted smokers can and do quit every day.
 3                   He said that anyone could quit.
 4                   Let's look at what he said about whether
 5             individual smokers have a choice and whether
 6             they must decide.
 7                   (Video clip was played as follows:)
 8             Q.    Doctor, do you agree with me that the
 9      individual smoker must decide whether or not to
10      continue smoking?
11             A.    I do.
12                   (Video clip concluded.)
13                   MR. BELASIC:  This was their first
14             expert.  This was the person they chose to
15             bring you on addiction.  This is the only
16             expert that does these large-scale smoking
17             cessation groups that he counsels.
18                   No one -- I certainly don't dispute, no
19             one disputes that Dr. Cummings is an expert on
20             this stuff.  Look at what he said.
21                   (Video clip was played as follows:)
22             Q.    Of the 50 million smokers who have quit
23      smoking, the majority of those people were addicted to
24      cigarettes, correct?
25             A.    Yes.

 1             Q.    So, when we talk about addiction, we
 2      don't mean that someone can't quit smoking.  True?
 3             A.    That's true.
 4             Q.    Because addicted smokers can and do quit
 5      smoking every day?
 6             A.    Yes.
 7                   (Video clip concluded.)
 8                   MR. BELASIC:  And, finally, Dr. Cummings
 9             said this:  The success rate for a certain type
10             of person -- let's see what type of person it
11             is -- but the success rate for a certain type
12             of person to quit is 100 percent.  Not 10, not
13             50, it's 100 percent.  Look what he says.
14                   (Video clip was played as follows:)
15             Q.    And when smokers come to your stop
16      smoking clinic, you tell them that the success rate
17      for quit among people who really want to quit and
18      stick to it is 100 percent, right?
19             A.    Yes, I do say that in my literature.
20             Q.    And you've testified in the past that
21      anyone can quit if they make up their mind to do it,
22      right?
23             A.    I have testified to that, yes.
24                   (Video clip concluded.)
25                   MR. BELASIC:  Not quite as quick with the

 1             answer, but you see that he said yep, that's
 2             true.
 3                   Really want to quit and stick to it.
 4                   Dr. Burns also agreed that anyone is
 5             capable of quitting, and Dr. Burns, when I
 6             asked him, addicted smokers, even if you call
 7             them addicted, they are still responsible.
 8             They don't get to say, I'm not responsible, I
 9             inhaled nicotine.
10                   He agreed addicted smokers are still
11             responsible for their smoking behavior.
12                   Well, was Mr. Skolnick the kind of person
13             who, quote, "really wanted to quit," was
14             motivated and stuck to it?
15                   Because Dr. Burns, his own expert, said
16             100 percent of those people can quit.
17                   Let's look at the evidence.  We know that
18             the U.S. Department of Health has said that
19             scientific studies suggest that everyone can
20             quit smoking.
21                   But let's judge the evidence on
22             Mr. Skolnick.  Y'all know in real life there is
23             a difference between what somebody says, yeah,
24             you'll do this, that sounds great, honey, and
25             what somebody actually does.

 1                   Let's review the evidence on what
 2             Mr. Skolnick said versus what he actually did.
 3             We know that Mrs. Skolnick says that he told
 4             her that he would either try to cut down or
 5             sometimes she phrases it "try to quit."
 6                   But when we explore with Mrs. Skolnick,
 7             with Barbara Skolnick, we find that what
 8             they're describing is he's actually saying he's
 9             going to cut down.  And then at some unknown
10             point in the future, that he might quit.
11                   And we know that he never just put his
12             cigarettes down and just said, I'm not going to
13             smoke now and I'll see how long I can go.
14                   Let's look at what he actually did.
15                   From 1947 -- and we have no evidence
16             beforehand -- throughout the 1950s, there is no
17             evidence in the record that he did anything to
18             quit smoking.
19                   In the 1960s, there's no evidence in the
20             record that he did anything specific to quit
21             smoking.
22                   And think about that.  Think about all
23             the evidence that is in the record about he saw
24             the Surgeon General's report in '64, his wife
25             talked to him.  Barbara talked to him.  His son

 1             Robert talked to him.  He saw the warnings.
 2                   But there is no specific evidence that he
 3             actually did something to try and stop smoking
 4             during that entire decade.
 5                   Now, in the 1970s, we know he went to --
 6             Mr. Schlesinger called it hippie-dippie.  He
 7             went to an EST meeting for two hours.
 8                   Also, in the 1970s -- I put down 1970s,
 9             because I think that's what Barbara said.  But
10             Mrs. Skolnick was uncertain.  We don't even
11             know for sure the date of the meditation.
12                   If you think of that, in the entire
13             decade, all he did to quit was go to one
14             meeting.  Remember, he quit EST.  He didn't
15             quit smoking.  And he did meditation for a
16             certain period of time.
17                   What about the '80s, ten more years?
18             What about the '80s?  We don't know.
19             Mrs. Skolnick said he would put a plastic
20             cigarette in his mouth for one or two months.
21             She said he might have gone to hypnosis.  She's
22             not positive.  I just put down an hour.  She
23             said he might have gone.
24                   Now, you add this all up and you're
25             looking at 45 years, a couple hours at one

 1             meeting, one hour maybe at hypnosis, a month or
 2             two of putting a plastic cigarette, and then
 3             meditation.
 4                   And the evidence on meditation is people
 5             aren't even certain if that was directly to
 6             quit smoking.
 7                   And the evidence from Mrs. Skolnick is he
 8             never cut down.  She did not observe him
 9             cutting down smoking, certainly not quitting
10             during meditation.
11                   So that's it, for 45 years.
12                   And Dr. Cummings said that a smoker who
13             is truly motivated to quit would throw away his
14             cigarettes, and we know Mr. Skolnick never did
15             that.  Throw away ashtrays.  We know
16             Mr. Skolnick didn't do that.
17                   Dr. Cummings, this is the expert that
18             they picked, said if you were motivated, you
19             would pick a quit date.  No evidence
20             Mr. Skolnick did that.
21                   Dr. Cummings said you would consult a
22             doctor.  Now, he went to lots of doctors, we
23             saw the medical records, you heard a lot of
24             different doctors, we know he went to doctors
25             when he had a problem.  Whether it was colon

 1             cancer, finding a tumor in his lung.  We know
 2             he went to doctors.
 3                   But no one ever suggested that he asked
 4             one of his doctors at any time for any help in
 5             quitting smoking.  And that's his right.  No
 6             one is blaming him.  He had that right.  He had
 7             a choice like everyone to use a legal product
 8             or quit.
 9                   But when plaintiffs say he really wanted
10             to quit, why didn't he ever ask a doctor for
11             help?  Why didn't he ask his own wife how she
12             quit successfully?  Why didn't he take the
13             steps that their expert says a truly motivated
14             person would do?
15                   Here's the things he didn't do.  We know
16             he wouldn't even watch the cessation program,
17             the TV program with his wife.  He didn't throw
18             away his cigarettes or his ashtrays.  He never
19             asked his wife, how did you do it?  He never
20             asked a doctor.  He never went to an actual
21             smoking cessation program.
22                   You know, his daughter Barbara said it
23             took her two years to convince him to go to
24             EST, and supposedly she said he thought EST was
25             a way to quit smoking.

 1                   So, again, if you really want to quit and
 2             you think this meeting called EST is a way to
 3             do it, why would you procrastinate for two
 4             years?  Doesn't that sound more like someone
 5             who doesn't want to quit?
 6                   But we do know he never went to a smoking
 7             cessation program.  And when nicotine gum was
 8             out, he never tried that either.
 9                   You've heard the evidence on what
10             Mr. Skolnick actually did.  Let me ask you to
11             consider this.  If I told you that I was on a
12             serious exercise program, I really wanted to
13             get myself fit, and you asked me what did you
14             do, and I said last year I went on the
15             treadmill for two hours or I dieted for two
16             hours or I went to the gym --
17                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me, Judge,
18             objection.
19                   THE COURT:  Sustained.  Don't make it
20             personal, Counsel.
21                   MR. BELASIC:  All right.
22                   Think about this.  If someone exercised
23             once in a year, if someone went on a diet for a
24             couple times a year, would it be reasonable to
25             conclude that that person, the person who just

 1             exercised once in a year, was seriously
 2             motivated to exercise?  Was seriously motivated
 3             to lose weight?
 4                   If someone said that in the entire time
 5             in the 1960s, all I did was go to a two-hour
 6             Weight Watcher meeting; the other nine days,
 7             364 days, I did nothing.  Of course no one
 8             would say that that person was motivated or
 9             they were making a serious and persistent
10             effort.
11                   Yet in this lawsuit, under the
12             plaintiff's theory, it's somehow different for
13             a smoker.  That they say that if someone did
14             one thing in a decade or meditated for a few
15             months or even a year in 45 years, that we are
16             supposed to believe that that person for 45
17             years was motivated and successful in quitting.
18                   If this wasn't a tobacco lawsuit and you
19             just compared it to real world efforts, what
20             we'd say is over the course of 45 years, there
21             is very little evidence that Mr. Skolnick was
22             doing any serious effort to quit.
23                   And, remember, that even what he was
24             doing, the evidence is he was telling people
25             I'm doing it to cut down, and cutting down

 1             isn't quitting.  Saying you're cutting down is
 2             saying you're continuing to smoke.
 3                   Eventually he needed to stop smoking.
 4             And he didn't do the efforts that his own
 5             expert, that his own expert said would show he
 6             was motivated.
 7                   Dr. Burns agreed with me.  He said while
 8             he talked about cutting down, no one actually
 9             observed him actually cutting down, at least
10             for any significant amount of time, in the
11             '50s, the '60s, the '70s, or '80s, and that's
12             their expert.
13                   I didn't have to bring someone.  There is
14             no dispute over who he favors.
15                   Dr. Burns has been paid $2.5 million to
16             testify in these lawsuits for plaintiffs who
17             sue a company, and he agreed that no one ever
18             saw Mr. Skolnick cutting down, period, during
19             those 40 years.
20                   And Barbara agreed.  That's his daughter.
21             There is no reason that his daughter would not
22             tell the truth about something like that.
23                   Now, we know that there's no direct
24             evidence of what happened to Mr. Skolnick
25             before 1947.  Dr. Burns told you that he

 1             thought Mr. Skolnick had become addicted before
 2             1947.  Let me ask you this:  To what?  What was
 3             he smoking before 1947?  Was it an
 4             R.J. Reynolds brand?  Was it a Philip Morris
 5             brand?  Did R.J. Reynolds do something to
 6             addict Mr. Skolnick before 1947?
 7                   Dr. Burns said he probably was addicted.
 8             Did Philip Morris do something wrong?
 9                   There is no evidence in this case that
10             R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris did anything
11             wrong to cause Mr. Skolnick to smoke.  We don't
12             know where he smoked.  We don't know what he
13             smoked.  There is no evidence of when he
14             started and what brand it was, and there is no
15             evidence that either defendant caused him to
16             become addicted.
17                   Because Dr. Burns said when Mrs. Skolnick
18             met him, he was already addicted.
19                   Now, one of the things you've agreed to
20             do is to decide this case solely on the
21             evidence.  I would submit to you with no
22             evidence whatsoever, it's simply a guess.  How
23             do we know what he was smoking in 1942?  Or
24             1938?  Or 1940?
25                   We don't know.  We don't know if he was

 1             smoking a cigarette made by another defendant.
 2             Of course the plaintiffs, it would be very
 3             convenient for the plaintiffs for you to just
 4             assume that Reynolds must have done something,
 5             but that's not evidence.
 6                   And it would be convenient to assume,
 7             well, maybe he tried a Philip Morris brand in
 8             the 1940s, but there would be no evidence.  And
 9             they don't dispute this.
10                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
11                   THE COURT:  Overruled.
12                   MR. BELASIC:  There is no evidence what
13             he smoked or who addicted him.  And yet now
14             they want to say, well, it was addiction to
15             Reynolds' products.
16                   Really?  If he was already addicted for
17             years, according to Dr. Burns, if addiction
18             means what they say it means, that somehow he's
19             compelled and caused to develop cancer.
20                   If he was already addicted.  If
21             R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris had gone out of
22             business in 1947, had not even existed,
23             according to Dr. Burns, he was already
24             addicted.
25                   And there was no evidence that he did

 1             anything before that time period that was
 2             wrong.  Including lung cancer.
 3                   Remember that when Dr. Proctor, their
 4             historian, came up, I asked him some historical
 5             questions.
 6                   And knowing that there's no evidence in
 7             this case, no evidence in this case at all that
 8             R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris did anything
 9             wrong that caused Mr. Skolnick to become
10             addicted, or caused him to smoke before this
11             1947 period, I asked him:  When does
12             Dr. Proctor, their expert, he's been paid more
13             than a million dollars, he made $100,000 just
14             the last month to testify.
15                   He said:  Well, you should have warned
16             about lung cancer in the mid 1950s.  But he'd
17             been smoking we know for a long time.  And
18             Dr. Burns said he was already addicted.
19             Addicted when there is no evidence that
20             R.J. Reynolds did it.
21                   And no matter how much sympathy you feel,
22             no matter how angry you may feel at some of
23             these documents, and they look ridiculous now
24             in the 2000s, no matter how angry you may feel,
25             you still have to decide the case on the

 1             evidence.
 2                   And they haven't presented a shred of
 3             evidence that R.J. Reynolds made this man
 4             become addicted, whatever their definition is,
 5             or Philip Morris did.  There's simply a blank
 6             before 1947.
 7                   And Dr. Burns comes here and says, oh, he
 8             was addicted years before.  I think he may have
 9             said as far back as eight to ten years.
10                   But Dr. Burns didn't say it was Reynolds'
11             fault, because no one has that evidence.  Their
12             own expert.  They couldn't meet their burden of
13             proof.  And because of that, you can't vote yes
14             on the first question.
15                   It can't be a direct cause.  Not when
16             they admit he was -- that he was addicted
17             already, and there's no evidence that it was
18             from anything that R.J. Reynolds or Philip
19             Morris did.
20                   One of the last things I would like you
21             to think about on this topic is we know
22             Mr. Skolnick and Mrs. Skolnick made different
23             choices.
24                   Even though they made different choices,
25             they lived together in the same environment,

 1             saw the same information, same advertising.
 2             They had the same cigarettes, whatever was in
 3             the smoke.  The same nicotine went into them.
 4                   But they made a different choice, and
 5             they met a different outcome.
 6                   So Mr. Skolnick got lung cancer.  They
 7             say it's primary lung cancer.  They say it's
 8             from smoking.
 9                   Mrs. Skolnick made a different choice.
10             She never got lung cancer.
11                   Everything else that R.J. Reynolds did,
12             good or bad, everything else that Philip Morris
13             did, good or bad, was exactly the same for
14             Mrs. and Mrs. Skolnick.
15                   So how do we explain the difference?  Why
16             would one get lung cancer and the other didn't,
17             when R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris acted
18             exactly the same?
19                   It's obvious.  They made different
20             choices.  And that choice, the choice to
21             continue smoking that Mr. Skolnick made and the
22             choice to quit that Mrs. Skolnick made, that's
23             cause, 100 percent.  That's the 100 percent
24             difference.  Everything else was the same.
25                   One got lung cancer because he made a

 1             different choice than his wife.
 2                   You know, even the recent Surgeon
 3             General's report in 2010 agrees to this extent.
 4             The Surgeon General says -- and this is one of
 5             the manuals they keep showing you -- it says:
 6             That tobacco dependence accounts for only a
 7             modest amount of variation in the risk of
 8             relapse.
 9                   When you look at people and people who
10             don't quit and relapse and continue smoking, is
11             it addiction that's the direct cause?  Is it
12             addiction that's a substantial cause?  No.
13             They say tobacco dependence accounts for only a
14             modest amount.
15                   Well, what is the reason?  Look what the
16             Surgeon General says.  It's consistent with the
17             notion that relapse, going back to smoking, is
18             a function of multiple person factors; that
19             it's the person, that it's the choice.
20                   A hundred percent of the difference in
21             the outcome, the reason that Mrs. Skolnick is
22             here today and the reason that she's now saying
23             that she should get $9 million because her
24             husband made the wrong choice was, in fact, the
25             choice.

 1                   The companies did nothing different to
 2             her or to anyone else.
 3                   Now, I will show you question 2.
 4                   For all those reasons you should vote no
 5             on question 1.  Addiction was simply not a
 6             direct cause, even if they could prove the
 7             medical link between the smoking and the
 8             cancer.
 9                   If you answer yes, you'll go to
10             question 2.  And you're going to be asked to
11             apportion negligence and to put this percentage
12             there.  And remember, the plaintiff has already
13             admitted that Leo Skolnick's actions were a
14             partial legal cause.
15                   Now, Mr. Hammer said, well, only 20
16             percent.  So all of these choices, all of the
17             years that he made those choices, they're still
18             going to say it's 80 percent the fault of the
19             manufacturer of the legal product, and they
20             want you to say only 20 percent.
21                   Well, we know that they wouldn't be
22             admitting that Mr. Skolnick caused his own
23             death if he didn't have the ability to quit,
24             and if he couldn't have quit at a time that
25             prevented his death.

 1                   We know Dr. Burns says he quits by the
 2             '70s, more likely than not he doesn't get lung
 3             cancer.  Could he have quit by the '70s, his
 4             experts say he could have.
 5                   THE CLERK:  You've used one hour.
 6                   MR. BELASIC:  Now, let's go back to what
 7             I'm talking about here.  Even if R.J. Reynolds
 8             and Philip Morris go out of business, does
 9             anyone think Mr. Skolnick wouldn't smoke?
10                   We know he already smoked another brand.
11             Chesterfields, made by Liggett.  We know that.
12             Mrs. Skolnick said --
13                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
14                   May I approach?
15                   THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
24                   THE COURT:  Okay.  The objection is
25             sustained.

 1                   You may proceed, sir.
 2                   MR. BELASIC:  Nothing that R.J. Reynolds
 3             or Philip Morris could have done would have
 4             prevented Mr. Skolnick's death.  This was a man
 5             that wanted to continue to smoke.
 6                   Remember what their own experts,
 7             Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns said.  It sounds
 8             stupid, but if you want to quit, you have to
 9             choose to quit first.  You have to want to quit
10             first.  That's what they say.  That's their
11             expert.
12                   Only he had the ability to prevent his
13             death.  R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, they
14             couldn't send someone from North Carolina or
15             somewhere to stop him from smoking.  He had to
16             choose.  He had to make the choice.
17                   His wife made that choice, even though
18             whatever R.J. Reynolds was doing was exactly
19             the same for her.  She made the choice.  She
20             quit.  Now she's here to sue, because her
21             husband made the wrong choice.
22                   And the only difference in outcome that
23             we've seen, what is the reason that
24             Mr. Skolnick got lung cancer if you believe
25             it's caused by smoking, that the plaintiffs are

 1             right?  What is the reason he got lung cancer
 2             and his wife didn't.  Same brands, same many
 3             years of smoking, same information.
 4                   Well, it's because he made a different
 5             choice, and that choice didn't cause 20 percent
 6             of his cancer, and his choice didn't cause 50
 7             percent of his cancer.  That choice is 100
 8             percent responsible for the difference.  It has
 9             to be.
10                   Because there's no difference in what
11             R.J. Reynolds did that could have affected
12             Mrs. Skolnick and her husband.  The difference
13             in outcome is because they went in two
14             different paths, and he made a different
15             choice.
16                   For that reason, you should find 100
17             percent it's unfair to now have Mrs. Skolnick
18             second-guess her husband's decision and say
19             that she should be rewarded with $9 million for
20             that decision.
21                   That's because of the different decisions
22             that we saw repeatedly on the decision tree.
23                   Now let's go to questions 3 and 4.
24                   Questions 3 and 4 on the verdict form --
25             oh, sorry, I think counsel is saying I should

 1             fill this out.
 2                   Leo Skolnick's choice, as proven by the
 3             difference between outcome, between him and his
 4             wife, was 100 percent responsible.  What Philip
 5             Morris and Reynolds did was the same to Barbara
 6             (sic) Skolnick as to Leo Skolnick.  The only
 7             difference was Leo Skolnick's different choice.
 8                   Now, questions 3 and 4 talk about whether
 9             or not something that R.J. Reynolds or a
10             tobacco company said or Philip Morris or a
11             tobacco company said caused Mr. Skolnick's
12             death.
13                   One thing I want to point out here is,
14             when the plaintiffs say that they are taking 20
15             percent responsibility or they ask you to take
16             20 percent responsibility, you should know that
17             that wouldn't apply to questions 3 or 4; that
18             if you voted yes on questions 3 and 4, that
19             admission of responsibility, that 20 percent,
20             50 percent, 100 percent, even if it's 100
21             percent, that wouldn't apply if you find yes.
22                   Now let's look at what the Judge is going
23             to tell you you have to consider.
24                   You have to determine whether Leo
25             Skolnick justifiably relied on a statement of

 1             material fact made by each defendant that
 2             intentionally omitted material information
 3             about the health effects or the addictive
 4             nature of smoking cigarettes.
 5                   So basically you have to find did he rely
 6             on something that Philip Morris said or
 7             R.J. Reynolds said that omitted material
 8             information.
 9                   But here's the big thing.  May 5th, 1982.
10             When did you ever hear that date in this trial?
11             Did you hear it in opening statement from the
12             plaintiffs?  Did you hear it from any of their
13             witnesses?  May 5th, 1982?
14                   Well, because you're going to hear it
15             now.  This is on the verdict form.  The entire
16             time of this trial, this was going to be the
17             question you were going to ask.  Did he rely on
18             something after May 5th, 1982.
19                   Now think about how many days, how many
20             days we spent in this trial talking about the
21             1950s, or the 1960s, or the 1920s, or the
22             1930s.  Think about how many hours they played
23             that video of Dr. Cummings talking about CTR in
24             the '50s and '60s.  Think about the two days
25             that Dr. Proctor was on the stand.

 1                   May 5th, '82.  The Judge is going to
 2             instruct you he -- he has instructed you.  When
 3             you decide whether he relied to his detriment
 4             on a statement, you may not consider evidence
 5             of statements, concealment, or other conduct
 6             that occurred before May 5th, 1982.
 7                   They wasted your time, ladies and
 8             gentlemen.  We spent a week talking about
 9             conduct before May 5, 1982.
10                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
11                   THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.
12                   MR. BELASIC:  None of that, none of that
13             evidence is relevant to questions 3 or 4.  None
14             of it.
15                   Judge Crow is instructing you that
16             Mr. Skolnick -- you cannot find that
17             Mr. Skolnick reasonably relied upon a statement
18             if he knew it was false or if its falsity was
19             known to him or if the fact that it was
20             concealed was already known to him.
21                   Now we know that for 20 years, he was
22             being warned by his family.  He was being told
23             by his son, his daughter, and his wife that the
24             health effects of smoking were dangerous.  He
25             heard it from the Surgeon General.

 1                   And we know from his daughter that
 2             there's no doubt that he believed that it
 3             caused cancer, no doubt that it was dangerous.
 4                   We know that when he responded to them he
 5             didn't say, hey, I don't believe it, I'm
 6             relying on a company statement.  He said, I'm
 7             going to try to quit.  His own daughter says
 8             there is no doubt.
 9                   There is no evidence -- there's no
10             evidence that after May 5th, 1982, that
11             Mr. Skolnick thought that smoking was safe.
12             Remember his sister died in '78.
13                   And remember what their own expert
14             Dr. Burns said, he said that was irrefutable.
15             Irrefutable demonstration to Mr. Skolnick
16             personally.  He knew that smoking could cause
17             lung cancer.  That's '78.
18                   But the truth is, his daughter Barbara
19             said there's no doubt he knew it could cause
20             lung cancer in '64.  And this is the cutoff.
21             This is the cutoff that applies, and it's the
22             cutoff that makes all that evidence, all those
23             statements and videos of old men on television,
24             irrelevant to questions 3 and questions 4.
25                   You cannot consider anything other than

 1             something after May 5th, 1982.  And there's no
 2             dispute -- there's no dispute that by 1982,
 3             he'd known that smoking could cause lung cancer
 4             for almost 20 years, there's no dispute.
 5                   Even Mrs. Skolnick said that everyone
 6             knew it was dangerous by the '70s.
 7                   Here is what Dr. Burns said.  1975, seven
 8             years before this 1982 cutoff.  More Americans
 9             knew cigarette smoking was more dangerous for
10             them than knew the name of the president of the
11             country.
12                   Dr. Burns, again, this is their expert,
13             their expert that they chose, '81.  So one year
14             before the cutoff.  He said:  It isn't that
15             smokers don't know the risk.  95 percent of
16             them are thoroughly aware of the health
17             dangers.  90 percent realize their health could
18             be affected.
19                   Now that is countrywide.  When it comes
20             to Mr. Skolnick, we know from his loved ones
21             that he'd known back since the '60s, and he
22             believed, he believed since the '60s, that
23             smoking could cause lung cancer.
24                   What do they do?  Do they have any
25             evidence after May 5, 1982, Mr. Skolnick saw

 1             something?  Do they have any evidence at all
 2             that he said, wow, now after 20 years of
 3             thinking that smoking could cause lung cancer
 4             and wanting to quit, now I think smoking is
 5             safe.  They have no such evidence.
 6                   So what do they do?  They talk about
 7             filters.  Here is what their own expert said.
 8             Dr. Proctor.  He said filters came out of the
 9             early '50s.
10                   Did Mr. Skolnick rush to switch to a
11             filter?  No.  Mrs. Skolnick said they didn't
12             switch to filters until Pall Malls came out in
13             1966.  And their own expert agrees.
14                   So this idea that he had been tricked by
15             filters and he was trying to do it, it doesn't
16             make sense, it doesn't comport with what their
17             own experts say.
18                   Look what Dr. Proctor said about the
19             Pall Mall ads.  He agreed.  I showed him the
20             ads.  Those ads didn't claim that filters were
21             safer.  That's the brand they picked.  That is
22             the filter they picked.  Those ads didn't say
23             safety.  They talked about flavor.
24                   He's the one that said that American
25             Tobacco, American Tobacco made the Pall Malls,

 1             that they were the most honest company on
 2             filters.
 3                   Here is these ads.  These are ads from
 4             before the filters came out.  Look what they
 5             say:  The long cigarette, long on flavor,
 6             they're mild.
 7                   Look what the filtered ad says.  Does
 8             this filtered ad say it's safe, it reduces your
 9             risk?  Don't quit?
10                   Is this the kind of thing that told
11             Mr. Skolnick that he didn't have to quit?  No.
12             It's the exact same thing.  The long cigarette
13             that's long on flavor, outstanding and they're
14             mild.
15                   And when I showed those to Dr. Proctor,
16             he agreed.  That's the company and that's the
17             brand that said nothing about safety.
18             Dr. Proctor agreed.  He said honest.  I didn't
19             use the word.  He said American Tobacco Company
20             and their Pall Mall filter ads were honest.
21                   And there is no other evidence.  There is
22             no other evidence.  No one here seriously came
23             in and said, in 1983, Mr. Skolnick thought that
24             smoking was safe.
25                   No one even made that claim.  Because the

 1             family, the people that knew him best had
 2             already admitted that at least by the '70s, and
 3             as early as '64, that he already thought it
 4             could cause lung cancer.
 5                   Now, I asked Dr. Burns, even if, let's
 6             say, he saw something in 1982 or '83 from a
 7             tobacco company, let's say.  Or if he didn't
 8             see it and he quit, what would have happened?
 9                   Dr. Burns agreed that if he quit after
10             this date, if he quit after the 1978 cutoff,
11             remember Dr. Burns said, I hate to call it a
12             cutoff.  But he agreed.
13                   If he quit after 1978, he said more
14             likely than not he gets lung cancer in 1993.
15             That is the only evidence.  That's the only
16             evidence on what would happen if Mr. Skolnick
17             had quit after that date.
18                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, I object.
19             Because it misstates the evidence.  That -- may
20             I approach?
21                   THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
22                   (The following discussion was held at
23                   sidebar:)
24                   THE COURT:  Can I see the chart?
25                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's not from the

 1             testimony.
 2                   THE COURT:  Hang on.  Just a minute.
 3                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  We have the entire
 4             transcript.  If he wants to quote from it,
 5             that's fine.  We can draw inferences to the
 6             evidence.  But this is the second time they are
 7             saying something the witness didn't say.  It's
 8             not a matter of I'm drawing an inference.  He
 9             didn't say that.
10                   THE COURT:  Specifically what did he say
11             that you're saying?
12                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  He just said that if he
13             quit -- if he quit after 1978, he still gets
14             cancer in 1983.  It's absolutely not what the
15             witness said, at all.  Didn't say it.
16                   He said he couldn't say with a reasonable
17             degree of medical probability he would not have
18             developed cancer at some time.  He did not say
19             that any time he didn't quit after '78, he was
20             going to get cancer in '83.  Utterly false.
21                   In this case, a wrongful death case.  And
22             Your Honor knows this from what you used to do
23             for a living is, a wrongful death action is
24             about wrongful death on the day you die.
25             That's what the case is about.  On the day you

 1             die.
 2                   If the wrongful death occurs on that day,
 3             it's a wrongful death case.  It's their burden
 4             to say when it would have occurred.  He doesn't
 5             have that testimony from that witness, and I
 6             challenge him to show you in the record that he
 7             does.  That's too far, Judge.
 8                   MR. BELASIC:  Flat out wrong.  The
 9             questions I gave to him were more likely than
10             not.
11                   First he said more likely than not if he
12             quits before '78, he avoids his lung cancer in
13             '93.  Then I say, What if he quits after '78?
14             He then cannot say more likely than not that he
15             would have avoided lung cancer in 1993.
16                   I asked then asked him about 1982.
17                   All of their questions, they then came
18             back on redirect and said, well, doesn't each
19             cigarette contribute?  Could it have
20             accelerated it?  Might he have lived a little
21             longer?  None of those were to a more likely
22             than not.  It's not an inference; it's what he
23             said.
24                   THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule the
25             objection.  Okay?  Thank you.

 1                   (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
 2                   following was held in open court:)
 3                   THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, let me
 4             remind you, you are the finders of fact in this
 5             case.  What the attorneys say is their
 6             understanding of what the testimony has been,
 7             but you are the one who determines what the
 8             facts were.
 9                   Go ahead, Counsel.
10                   MR. BELASIC:  There's a reason I made
11             this chart with Dr. Burns, so you could see
12             what Dr. Burns was saying.  Dr. Burns didn't
13             dispute this.
14                   If he quits before '78, more likely than
15             not he avoids his cancer in '93.  If he quits
16             after, and I asked him particularly what if he
17             quits in '82, can you say that more likely than
18             not he avoids his cancer?  He said no.
19                   That's the only evidence about when he
20             gets cancer.  Where is that important?  Why is
21             that important?
22                   Well, because they don't just have to
23             show that he relied on a statement.  They have
24             to show that relying on a statement caused his
25             death; that somehow something he read in 1983

 1             or 1984 was the legal cause of his death.
 2                   Now, Dr. Burns said even if he quit then,
 3             he couldn't say he would have avoided it.  It's
 4             their burden of proof.
 5                   But all of this is much ado about
 6             nothing.  Because everyone agrees that by
 7             May 5, 1982, he believed smoking was dangerous.
 8             He had thought smoking caused cancer since the
 9             '60s, and this is what changes it.  May 5th,
10             1982.
11                   There's nothing in this record that says
12             that anything after that makes a difference.
13             Nothing in this record that says after '82, he
14             thought smoking was safe.  It doesn't matter
15             how many filters he smoked.
16                   Nobody is claiming that he didn't know
17             those filters were dangerous.  They had the
18             exact same warning, including the lung cancer
19             warning, that every other pack had.
20                   So you should vote no on both 3 and 4.
21             And it's because of testimony from Barbara
22             Skolnick, testimony from Dr. Burns.  There's no
23             doubt Dr. Burns says it was irrefutable by 1978
24             when Sunny died, when his sister died,
25             irrefutable that he knew that smoking could

 1             cause lung cancer.
 2                   I want to talk briefly about damages.
 3                   They're asking for $9 million.
 4             $9 million because Mr. Skolnick continued to
 5             smoke and passed away, while his wife made a
 6             decision to stop.  And as they said, she's
 7             healthy today.
 8                   Remember that when Mr. Skolnick died in
 9             1993 -- first of all, that was 20 years ago.
10             When he died, he was 75 years old.  75 years
11             old.
12                   And you heard talk about life expectancy
13             from Mr. Hammer.  Did you ever hear a shred of
14             evidence on what a 75-year-old man's life
15             expectancy was?  Remember, he was a 75-year-old
16             man who already had colon cancer.
17                   Was there a shred of evidence in this
18             case what the life expectancy of a 75-year-old
19             man with colon cancer was?  You know.
20                   When Mrs. Skolnick testified, it was
21             extremely emotional, and there is no doubt she
22             loved her husband.  In the record, it appears
23             he was a wonderful man.  But you agreed to put
24             your sympathy aside.
25                   So when you talk about life expectancy,

 1             obviously it sounds cold.  But you understand,
 2             I have to address this, because Mr. Hammer is
 3             talking about life expectancy, and he's talking
 4             about in the future.
 5                   You know, when Mr. Skolnick died, he was
 6             75.  That was 20 years ago.  Today he would be
 7             95 years old, and they wanted another five
 8             years of future damages.  They're basically
 9             saying that he would have lived to be 100
10             without a shred of evidence.
11                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, object.
12             This goes to Mrs. Skolnick.  I object.
13                   THE COURT:  Overruled.
14                   MR. BELASIC:  They want five years of
15             future damages, until 2018.  Five years from
16             now is 2018.
17                   He was born in 1918.  He was 75 when he
18             died, and there's no -- why -- did a doctor
19             come and testify?  Could they have asked his
20             doctors?
21                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, may I
22             approach?
23                   (The following discussion was held at
24                   sidebar:)
25                   THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

 1                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  The damages are
 2             Mrs. Skolnick's damages for her life expectancy
 3             from this point forward, not for his life
 4             expectancy.  No such claim.  Future damages.
 5                   MR. BELASIC:  But --
 6                   THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Go
 7             ahead.
 8                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  In other words, we
 9             didn't say he would be 95 or 100 or anything
10             like that.  We got the future damages line in
11             because Mrs. Skolnick is a hale woman, and
12             she's well met, and she's 86, and she has her
13             future pain and suffering for the years she
14             lost Leo, regardless of whether he's alive or
15             not.
16                   THE COURT:  As I understand the law, in
17             determining duration of such losses you may
18             consider the joint life expectancy of
19             Mr. Skolnick and Mrs. Skolnick together.
20                   So that's joint life expectancy.  You
21             can't get to the rest of her life if he wasn't
22             going to live.  Let me give you a classic
23             example.  Suppose he was dying of some other
24             disease, but died of lung cancer before.  You
25             don't get her life -- it's joint life

 1             expectancy is the measure of damages.
 2                   It says ... companionship, protection,
 3             mental pain and suffering, resulting ... in
 4             determination of duration of losses, you may
 5             consider the joint life expectancy of
 6             Mr. Skolnick and Mrs. Skolnick together with
 7             the other evidence in the case.
 8                   You can't get loss of companionship if he
 9             wasn't going to be alive.  I don't mean to
10             argue.
11                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  My recollection
12             was --
13                   MR. BELASIC:  I think we've argued for
14             that.  But furthermore, they were more direct.
15             Mr. Hammer said that he would have been able to
16             see his grandchildren's graduation.  Their
17             graduations, in 2012 and 2013?
18                   THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule the
19             objection.
20                   (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
21                   following was held in open court:)
22                   MR. BELASIC:  As I was saying, there's
23             not a shred of evidence that he would live to
24             be 95, 100, 90, 85.  He was 75.  He had a
25             history of lung cancer.

 1                   Everyone here wishes they would live
 2             forever.  Wished that he would have had a long
 3             life.  But they have a burden of proof.  They
 4             don't just get to say look at Mrs. Skolnick,
 5             she's healthy, and say that he would have
 6             lived.  That's not evidence.
 7                   Mr. Hammer wants you to believe that he
 8             could have lived for many, many years.  But
 9             where is the evidence?
10                   Three doctors took the stand:  Dr. Burns,
11             Dr. Barry Davis, and the initial doctor, the
12             radiologist.  And there was no testimony.  No
13             one even presented a shred of evidence.
14                   And yet that's what this $9 million.
15             $9 million, because now, totally
16             understandably, she regrets the decision that
17             her husband made to use a legal product.  But
18             there isn't any evidence on that.
19                   Let me talk finally about -- let me talk
20             finally about question 6.  I think I've lost my
21             clicker.
22                   Question 6 is this question of is
23             Mrs. Skolnick entitled not just to the
24             $9 million, but for additional damages.  Please
25             state whether you find by clear and convincing

 1             evidence that punitive damages are warranted.
 2                   And you saw the jury instruction.  He
 3             read it.  It had to be gross and flagrant to
 4             show a reckless disregard of human life.  It
 5             said there has to show an entire lack of care
 6             that wanton and recklessly disregarded the
 7             safety.
 8                   Well, look, their main argument is that
 9             somehow Mr. Skolnick was deceived, and they've
10             said for 50 years there was this conspiracy to
11             conceal information.  Was the information about
12             the risks of smoking, was it really secret?
13                   And what I mean is not that did the
14             tobacco companies go out and say some
15             confession that Mr. Hammer said.  But was it
16             secret?
17                   If you didn't live in a tobacco company,
18             were you able to know that smoking could be
19             dangerous or addictive?
20                   You saw all this stuff.  One hundred
21             years ago, the Florida Health Department.  No
22             help from the tobacco company, saying
23             addictive.  A hundred years ago.  It wasn't a
24             secret.
25                   You can argue about what should they have

 1             said, when should they have said it, should
 2             they have acted in a different way.
 3                   The tobacco companies today won't even
 4             disagree with that.  You can argue that.  But
 5             to claim it's secret.  This is 100 years ago.
 6             1915, that's 100 -- 98 years ago.
 7                   All the things from Reader's Digest.  You
 8             probably thought at one point this was a trial
 9             about who could put up the most Reader's Digest
10             articles.  But the point was, it was the single
11             most popular magazine, it was the common source
12             of information for ordinary people that weren't
13             scientists, that weren't lawyers, that weren't
14             tobacco company executives.
15                   Even as far back as 1924, we saw that it
16             was saying that smoking could cause cancer.
17             How did they know if the tobacco companies had
18             this huge conspiracy to conceal.
19                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge, we
20             have findings on this.
21                   THE COURT:  Overruled.  I'm going to
22             allow it.
23                   MR. BELASIC:  Of course, as Dr. Proctor
24             says, there is no conspiracy before 1954.  As
25             Dr. Proctor said, he didn't even think the

 1             tobacco companies had a duty to warn then.  And
 2             yet Mr. Skolnick was smoking.
 3                   We don't know what brand.  And Dr. Burns
 4             says Mr. Skolnick was already addicted.
 5                   So how could this conspiracy that didn't
 6             start until after this man was addicted, that
 7             didn't start until after this man was addicted
 8             to a brand we don't know, made by a company
 9             that we don't know is R.J. Reynolds or Philip
10             Morris, how did that cause his harm?
11                   And remember, the instructions say that
12             when you consider whether to award punitives,
13             it has to be for conduct that caused the damage
14             to the plaintiff, in this case to Mr. Skolnick.
15             Not for something else that caused harm to
16             others.  The instructions say you have to look
17             at what caused harm to him.
18                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
19                   THE COURT:  Sustained.
20                   MR. BELASIC:  So Reader's Digest, 1950.
21                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, I move to
22             strike the last comment.
23                   THE COURT:  The jury should disregard the
24             last comment.
25                   Go ahead.

 1                   MR. BELASIC:  Let's go back to the jury
 2             instructions.  Punitive damages are warranted.
 3             This is what Judge Crow has given you:  If you
 4             find by clear and convincing evidence that the
 5             conduct causing loss to the plaintiff.  That is
 6             the express black letter instructions.
 7                   You have to determine if the conduct
 8             causing loss to the plaintiff.
 9                   So not some brand that he didn't smoke,
10             not some Camel that has a pink or an orange
11             box.  It has to be evidence that relates and
12             causes loss to the plaintiff.  Not injuries to
13             others.  That's the instruction.
14                   Now, it wasn't even disputed that all
15             throughout the '50s, there was all kinds of
16             public awareness.  It was in Life Magazine.  We
17             know that they had -- they had Life Magazine in
18             their house, they had Reader's Digest in their
19             house in the 1950s.  We know that he was an
20             avid newspaper reader.
21                   Here you remember this, they just talked
22             about Claude Teague.  And again,
23             Mr. Schlesinger brought up their Latin term
24             sine qua non.
25                   Well, here is a 1950s article written by

 1             a boxer, not a chemist, not a tobacco company
 2             executive.  A boxer, 22 years earlier, was
 3             writing in the most popular magazine in America
 4             that nicotine was the essential ingredient.
 5                   This wasn't secret.  They want to take a
 6             sentence and say, oh, this looks bad, now we
 7             get 9 million.  That's not a secret.  That was
 8             common knowledge in the most obvious place in
 9             the world, Reader's Digest.
10                   We know that he was an avid reader of the
11             New York Times, the New York Newsday on Long
12             Island, and sometimes the New York Post.  It
13             was widely covered over and over and over
14             again.
15                   We know that as a result, millions and
16             millions of people quit when they saw the
17             warnings.  Millions and millions of people
18             quit.  We know that more than 50 million have
19             quit.
20                   And they quit on their own.  Look at
21             this, 90 percent quit on their own.  They
22             didn't need -- they talk about today you have
23             drugs or Chantix or other things, 90 percent of
24             those people were quitting on their own.
25                   That's what Mr. Skolnick could do.

 1             That's what their experts admitted, that not
 2             just smokers in general, but Mr. Skolnick could
 3             have done that.
 4                   Now they brought up some charges, they
 5             say you tricked the Surgeon General.  We know
 6             that the Surgeon General relied on a 6,000 --
 7             on this monograph that was provided.  He
 8             actually thanked the companies.
 9                   We know that every one of the
10             constituents and carcinogens that were listed
11             in the Surgeon General's report were provided
12             by the tobacco companies.  They weren't keeping
13             a secret what the chemicals were when they did
14             smoke analysis, and that was from Dr. Proctor.
15                   We know from Dr. Proctor that it was a
16             legitimate dispute at the time, that a lot of
17             physicians weren't prepared to understand the
18             statistical data, that it wasn't wrong to say,
19             hey, we don't think statistics by themselves
20             are proof.  Even Dr. Proctor admitted that.
21                   The Surgeon General says that here.  The
22             Surgeon General's report said that statistics
23             by themselves couldn't prove cause and effect.
24                   And yet time and time again, when they
25             would show you some statement, a statement that

 1             Mr. -- a statement that Mr. Skolnick never
 2             heard, it would be about whether there was
 3             enough proof, whether statistics are needed,
 4             whether there was animal evidence.
 5                   The Surgeon General himself said that
 6             there was a debate over this.
 7                   They mentioned polonium --
 8                   THE CLERK:  You've used about an hour and
 9             a half, sir.
10                   MR. BELASIC:  Okay.  Thank you.
11                   They mentioned polonium.  And they had a
12             clever drawing of a pack of cigarettes, and it
13             was a smokestack.  Obviously that was meant to
14             imply it was like Sylvania.  Polonium 210.
15                   I don't know if you remember who
16             testified on polonium 210.  That was
17             Dr. Proctor, their witness that has been paid
18             800,000 in the last three years.
19                   And here's what he said:  Polonium comes
20             from fertilizer, in the ground from fertilizer.
21             He said there are only trace amounts.  He
22             admitted that the Surgeon General studied it,
23             and that the polonium in smoke that comes from
24             fertilizer is not important to cancer.
25                   And really important, their favorite

 1             Surgeon General's report, the one they go to
 2             over and over again, 2010, says that filters
 3             remove significant portions of the polonium.
 4                   Remember that when they say filters are a
 5             fraud.  That the one thing in smoke they
 6             complain about, the one thing in smoke that the
 7             Surgeon General says is not important to
 8             cancer, they claim filters can't do anything,
 9             polonium is so important, the current Surgeon
10             General's report says that it does remove it.
11             We're not making this up.
12                   Here is what we showed Dr. Proctor.  This
13             is the Surgeon General's report, polonium 210.
14             We talked about the range is 1 to 50
15             picocuries.
16                   I asked Dr. Proctor, and he agreed that
17             in the amount Mr. Skolnick did, it would be
18             about 4.  So almost at the bottom end of this
19             range, barely above zero.
20                   And look at what the Surgeon General
21             says:  Of some importance, only in the case of
22             relatively high concentration, but not
23             important at reported levels.
24                   And Dr. Proctor agreed with me.  He
25             didn't dispute it.  They didn't present any

 1             evidence that the tiny amount of polonium that
 2             comes from fertilizers that are used not just
 3             to grow tobacco, but to grow lettuce and
 4             tomatoes and other things fertilizers are used
 5             for.  They didn't present a shred of evidence
 6             on that.
 7                   But they want you to be scared about
 8             polonium 210.  The Surgeon General and their
 9             own expert said, quote, "not important."
10                   They talked about crack cocaine.  I'm
11             surprised they brought that up because I --
12             crack nicotine.
13                   Because I asked Dr. Proctor about that.
14             I said:  Wait a second.  Crack nicotine?
15             That's the chapter of his book and this pH.
16                   I said:  Didn't the Surgeon General find
17             that the pH of the normal smoke is below this
18             level, 6.5?  It has only the bound nicotine,
19             none of this free nicotine?
20                   He admitted that.  This is what the
21             Surgeon General found.
22                   That was a snazzy chapter title, Crack
23             Nicotine, but Dr. Proctor didn't fight me.  He
24             admitted that in normal cigarettes, mainstream
25             commercial cigarettes, you don't have, quote,

 1             "free nicotine."
 2                   And this is the Surgeon General looking
 3             at it.  Not tobacco company evidence.  So
 4             that's just something they toss out there to
 5             scare you.
 6                   Dr. Burns said that even today, the
 7             cigarettes today aren't more addictive; that
 8             they've done studies.  The people that are
 9             smoking today -- there's still plenty of people
10             that enjoy smoking and choose to smoke.
11                   The people that smoke today are no more
12             addicted than the ones who stopped.  And, in
13             fact, there's a higher percentage of occasional
14             smokers.  And the new generation, their
15             behavior is consistent with less, rather than
16             more addiction.
17                   And that's Dr. Burns' writings.  That's
18             their expert.  He agreed.  Smokers today are
19             less addicted.
20                   They've never denied that this is a
21             secret document.  Secret document from the
22             president of Reynolds to Dr. Murray Senkus.
23             Dr. Proctor knew about it, and he agreed that
24             the president of R.J. Reynolds was commanding
25             his top R&D guy to say -- to cooperate with

 1             others, push the work concerning tobacco and
 2             health, promote the relationships with
 3             government, and if there's a safer cigarette,
 4             let's continue and increase our efforts.
 5                   That's what Dr. Proctor agreed.  That's a
 6             secret document.  They weren't doing that to
 7             look good.  Internally they were telling their
 8             top guy to cooperate.  And, of course, they did
 9             with the Tobacco Working Group.
10                   We found that for five to ten years,
11             according to Dr. Proctor, they made hundreds of
12             specialty-designed cigarettes in cooperation
13             with the government.  It was voluntary, they
14             didn't have to do it.
15                   He said they looked at almost every
16             possible design, and what happened?  The
17             government shut it down in 1978.
18                   You can only judge the punitive damages
19             on conduct that caused his injury.  And we know
20             that every single one of those things --
21                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
22                   THE COURT:  Sustained.
23                   MR. BELASIC:  We know that every single
24             thing that R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris did
25             also was done in the same environment as

 1             Mrs. Skolnick.  She didn't get lung cancer
 2             because she made a different choice than her
 3             husband in 1968.
 4                   So you should vote no on number 6.
 5                   The only way you can explain the
 6             difference between the outcome for
 7             Mrs. Skolnick and her husband -- and there's no
 8             doubt she misses him and he was a wonderful
 9             man, but the only way you can explain the
10             difference is their different choices.
11                   It wasn't R.J. Reynolds or Philip
12             Morris's conduct.
13                   It's been a long trial.  I know every one
14             of you made a personal sacrifice to come here
15             every day.  Give up your lives, your work.  So
16             I mean, all I can say is you have my sincere
17             appreciation.  I thank you for your attention
18             today.
19                   When they get up, Mr. Schlesinger has 45
20             minutes for rebuttal.  I don't get to respond.
21             So I ask you to think about the evidence and
22             think about maybe what I would say and what
23             evidence I would point out to counter what
24             Mr. Schlesinger is going to say.
25                   Thank you again.


22                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Thank you, Your Honor.
23                   May it please the Court, counsel, ladies
24             and gentlemen of the jury.  Good afternoon.
25                   Here I am, the last guy to talk to you

 1             today, and I can tell you it was with mixed
 2             emotions that I figured out that I was going to
 3             be talking to you at quarter of 3 after you
 4             heard arguments starting at about 9:00 this
 5             morning.
 6                   So I'm going to do my very best to be
 7             expeditious.  I am going to do my very best not
 8             to take 54 minutes, even though I could, and I
 9             am going to do my very best not to be
10             repetitive.
11                   But first, let me say, again, thank you
12             to y'all.  We've all been here for a long time.
13             All of us are here because it's our job to be
14             here.  And we know that you all have been here
15             when it's not your job to be here.  You have
16             other things going on, and you've made lots of
17             sacrifices.
18                   So I very much appreciate your efforts,
19             and I think the best thing I can do to show my
20             appreciation is just get going.  And so I'm
21             going to do that.
22                   I'm going to talk about two topics.  Two
23             topics.  The first one is going to be filters,
24             and the second one is going to be radiation.
25                   We are going to talk about filters

 1             because we've heard a lot of talk about
 2             filters.
 3                   Mr. Schlesinger has talked about how
 4             filters don't do anything, how filters were a
 5             illusion, how they were a health reassurance.
 6                   So I am going to talk about what the
 7             facts actually are about filters.
 8                   And I am going to talk about radiation.
 9             Radiation is important for two reasons in this
10             case.  The first reason radiation is important
11             is it explains.  It explains why Mrs. Skolnick
12             said what she said in the declaration that she
13             submitted in that prior lawsuit.
14                   And the second reason radiation is
15             important is because it shows that plaintiff
16             cannot sustain the burden of proof she has, the
17             burden of proof that she has, to prove that the
18             lung cancer in this case was caused by smoking
19             and not by something else.
20                   So those are the two things I'm going to
21             talk about.
22                   Let's go to filters right away.  And when
23             we started this morning, I wrote down something
24             that Mr. Schlesinger said.  Mr. Schlesinger
25             said nothing was being taken out with filters.

 1             Nothing was being taken out with filters.
 2                   That's something they've said this whole
 3             trial.  Let's talk about what the facts are.
 4             What the facts actually show.
 5                   And let's talk about what the facts show
 6             in the words of their own expert.  The great
 7             man of science that Mr. Schlesinger talked
 8             about, Dr. Burns.
 9                   Doctor, filters remove a fraction of
10             particulate matter from the smoke by keeping it
11             within the filter; is that right?
12                   Dr. Burns says:  That's correct.
13                   What else is in the evidence?  The
14             Surgeon General's report from 2010.  Remember
15             the plaintiffs read from the Surgeon General's
16             report 2010.  Frequently.  What does it say?
17                   Studies have also shown that cellulose
18             acetate filter tips remove both volatile
19             nitrosamines and TSNAs.  Filters are removing
20             things.
21                   What else does the Surgeon General's
22             report 2010 say?
23                   The presence of a filter and the type of
24             filter used can alter the amount of polonium.
25             This is what Mr. Belasic was just talking

 1             about.  Filters remove things.
 2                   So what does that tell us?  What do we
 3             know?  What do we know when we look at the
 4             facts about what the health effects and what
 5             the history of filters were.
 6                   And y'all may remember, I think it was
 7             back with Dr. Proctor, way back with
 8             Dr. Proctor at the beginning of the case.
 9                   I talked to Dr. Proctor about how filters
10             came about and why they came about.  And you
11             might remember, I actually did a handwritten
12             chart, something like this.  But I turned it
13             into a chart like this.
14                   And Dr. Proctor confirmed that what
15             happened back in the 1950s, was that scientists
16             made a link between cigarette smoking and
17             cancer.  And specifically what they made a link
18             to was tar, the tar in smoke.
19                   So scientists saw that there was tar in
20             smoke, and there was cancer going on.  They put
21             the tar on the back of mice.  You might
22             remember there was that kind of nasty picture
23             of mice in Life Magazine, and they put the tar
24             on them and it caused cancer.
25                   So they said if tar is bad, then less is

 1             better.  If tar is bad, less is better, and
 2             filters were going to reduce the tar.
 3                   And so that's what everybody was saying
 4             back in the 1950s.  They were saying because
 5             tar is bad, let's make less of it, let's have
 6             smokers get less of it, and let's use these
 7             filters which we now know from Dr. Burns and
 8             the Surgeon General's report of 2010, remove
 9             things, let's make it better.
10                   That's what the public health community
11             said.  That's what the Surgeon General said.
12             That's what academics said, that's what
13             everybody said starting back in that period of
14             time.
15                   And then what happened?  And then what
16             happened?
17                   Recommendations were made.  You should
18             quit smoking.  That was the first thing.  You
19             should quit, for sure you should quit.  But if
20             you're not going to quit, you should smoke a
21             filtered cigarette.
22                   And what was the basis for those
23             recommendations?  This is a chart that I made
24             when Dr. Burns was on the stand.  Dr. Burns was
25             on the stand.  And we talked about something

 1             called epidemiology, which is a science.  And
 2             it was a science that studied cigarettes.  The
 3             basic idea of the science is it's a science of
 4             populations.
 5                   So you look at a population of people and
 6             compare it to another population of people, and
 7             you see what diseases arise in both populations
 8             of people.  Are there differences?  Could the
 9             differences be due to the differences in the
10             people?
11                   So the populations that we were talking
12             about with Dr. Burns was the population of
13             people who smoked filtered cigarettes and
14             people who smoked unfiltered cigarettes.
15                   And what the epidemiology showed and
16             still shows to this day -- to this day, is that
17             smokers of filtered cigarettes get less
18             disease.  Less disease occurrence.  Meaning
19             lung cancer.
20                   That's what Dr. Burns said when he was on
21             the witness stand right there.  Smokers of
22             filtered cigarettes get less disease than
23             smokers of unfiltered cigarettes.
24                   This is real-world smokers.  This isn't
25             theoretical science, this isn't some article

 1             where we're just talking in the abstract.  This
 2             is looking at actual real-world smokers and
 3             tracking what happens to them.
 4                   How many of them get lung cancer in the
 5             filtered camp?  How many get lung cancer in the
 6             unfiltered camp?  Less disease occurrence in
 7             the unfiltered camp.
 8                   And the thing about this testing, the
 9             thing about this study of epidemiology,
10             millions of people -- millions of people were
11             studied when they did these studies.  Millions
12             of people.
13                   And there is one other important thing
14             about this epidemiology.  Had nothing to do
15             with the tobacco companies.  This was
16             epidemiology done by independent scientists,
17             done by government scientists, done by people
18             at the American Cancer Society.  This was not
19             done by the tobacco companies.
20                   And so what Dr.-- they found, starting in
21             the 1950s, is that the epidemiology, this
22             independent science, showed that there was less
23             disease among the group that smoked filtered
24             cigarettes.
25                   And we went through.  We went through

 1             some of the Surgeon General's reports to show
 2             what the Surgeon General was actually saying
 3             and recommending over time.
 4                   This is the Surgeon General's report from
 5             1975.  This is the Surgeon General.  This isn't
 6             the tobacco companies, this is the Surgeon
 7             General.
 8                   A smoker who switches to filtered
 9             cigarettes and has smoked them for ten years or
10             longer has a lower risk of developing lung
11             cancer than a smoker who continues to smoke
12             nonfilter cigarettes.
13                   Less disease occurrence in filtered
14             cigarette smokers.
15                   1979, Surgeon General's report.  Again,
16             the long-term use, ten years or more, of
17             filtered cigarettes is associated with lower
18             death rates from lung cancer than those
19             experienced by persons who smoke an equal
20             number of nonfilter cigarettes.
21                   Less disease occurrence in filtered
22             cigarette smokers.
23                   Surgeon General's report, 1981.  Today's
24             filter tipped, lower tar and nicotine
25             cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer

 1             than do higher tar and nicotine predecessor.
 2                   Less disease occurrence in filtered
 3             cigarettes.
 4                   So what happens then?  Skipping ahead to
 5             shortly after Mr. Skolnick passed away.  1996.
 6             NCI is the National Cancer Institute, part of
 7             the United States government.
 8                   What did they say?  Filtered tip
 9             cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer
10             than do their higher tar and nicotine
11             predecessors.
12                   That's what was going on.  That's what
13             was actually happening during the time periods
14             in question in this case.
15                   Now, Dr. Burns, to be sure, changed his
16             mind.
17                   Dr. Burns told you from the witness
18             stand.  He said that for this entire period of
19             time -- not all the way back to the '50s,
20             because he was too young then.  But he started
21             working in this field in the '70s.  From that
22             time up until 2000, he himself was recommending
23             filtered cigarettes.  He was recommending
24             low-tar cigarettes.
25                   But he changed his mind in 2000.  Why did

 1             he change his mind?  Why did he change his
 2             mind?
 3                   Well, he changed his mind not because of
 4             any change in this.  He confirmed that it is
 5             still the case.  That if you look at filtered
 6             cigarette smokers, they get less disease.  If
 7             you look at unfiltered cigarette smokers, they
 8             get more disease.
 9                   But what Dr. Burns changed his mind about
10             was he said, well, maybe the difference in
11             those two groups isn't because of the filter on
12             the cigarettes.  He said maybe the difference
13             is because this is a healthier group overall
14             and they get less disease because of that.
15                   But the fundamental fact is that filtered
16             cigarette smokers still show less disease
17             occurrence.
18                   Now, they brought to trial Dr. Burns, and
19             that was his view.  That was his view.  He
20             changed his position.  But not everybody agreed
21             with Dr. Burns.
22                   Others disagreed.
23                   Others believed that filtered cigarettes
24             provided benefit.  So we saw the International
25             Agency on Research of Cancer from 2009.  Very

 1             recent.  That is an international cancer
 2             research organization that looked at the same
 3             question.
 4                   And they concluded, compared with smokers
 5             of medium tar, filtered cigarettes, risk was
 6             higher among men and women who smoked high-tar,
 7             non-filtered brands.
 8                   They took a different view than
 9             Dr. Burns, they took a different view.
10                   The Surgeon General's report of 2010,
11             when it talks specifically about filters, it
12             seems to recognize that there's a difference in
13             view.
14                   It says:  The wide variation in filter
15             technology across brands and over time
16             precludes general conclusions about whether
17             filters increase or decrease exposure of
18             smokers to toxicants.
19                   So they recognize this is an issue here.
20             There is an issue.  Even today there is an
21             issue.
22                   But that doesn't mean it's a fraud for
23             somebody like IARC to say that filtered
24             cigarettes provide a benefit?
25                   Filtered cigarette smokers get less

 1             disease still.
 2                   Unfiltered cigarette smokers get more
 3             disease still.  That's still the fact today.
 4                   So there is no fraud.  There is no great
 5             deception by the tobacco companies, when it's
 6             everybody but the tobacco companies that are
 7             saying filters are good, based on the evidence
 8             that they had.
 9                   Now, one other thing to keep in mind
10             about this, others disagree.  There's been a
11             lot of talk in this case about tobacco company
12             documents coming out and that changed the
13             world.  That changed the whole world.
14                   So people realized that filtered
15             cigarettes were a problem when these documents
16             came out.
17                   But those documents came out here in
18             2000.  IARC, the Surgeon General 2010 that
19             disagreed with Dr. Burns on the filter point,
20             they did so after the tobacco company documents
21             came out.  Afterwards.
22                   And one other thing I just want to
23             caution you about.  Counsel goes to frequently
24             read from the Surgeon General report of 2010
25             and says that it says such-and-such and

 1             such-and-such.
 2                   There are all kinds of issues covered in
 3             the Surgeon General report of 2010.  All kinds
 4             of issues covered in that report.  There are
 5             filter issues, there are low-tar cigarette
 6             issues, there are light cigarette issues.
 7                   Counsel put something up in front of you.
 8             Make sure that it's about filters when we're
 9             talking about this issue.  This is not a case
10             about low-tar cigarettes.  This is not a case
11             about light cigarettes.
12                   Counsel, I think said, I think said that
13             Mr. Skolnick smoked light cigarettes.  That's
14             not true.  Never did.  Not an issue in this
15             case.
16                   When you look at where the Surgeon
17             General report deals with filter technology, it
18             says less disease occurrence in filtered
19             cigarettes, more disease occurrence in
20             unfiltered cigarettes, after looking at
21             millions and millions of people.
22                   Now, let's talk about Mr. Skolnick
23             specifically.  Because that's why we're here.
24                   Mr. Skolnick started smoking filtered
25             cigarettes in the 1960s.  Around 1966.  You

 1             heard Mr. Belasic talked about the Pall Malls
 2             and the whole conversation with Dr. Proctor
 3             about Pall Malls and how Mrs. Skolnick said
 4             that Pall~Malls were the first filtered
 5             cigarette they smoked.  So that wasn't until
 6             the 1960s.
 7                   Now Mrs. Skolnick said they started to
 8             smoke filters when they first came out.  That
 9             would have been the '50s, so that's not
10             accurate.
11                   But 1960s is when Mr. Skolnick first
12             started to smoke filtered cigarettes.
13                   THE CLERK:  39 minutes left.
14                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Thank you.
15                   Mr. Skolnick smoked filtered cigarettes
16             from the 1960s until he passed away, that
17             period of time.  And throughout that entire
18             period of time, the Surgeon General, the
19             American Cancer Society, every public health
20             organization were saying that filters are good.
21             And if you're going to continue to smoke,
22             Mr. Skolnick and others like you, you should
23             smoke filter cigarettes.
24                   The entire time, that's what they said.
25             The entire time, that's what they said.

 1                   So there has been no intentional omission
 2             of important data, important health data,
 3             material health data by the tobacco companies
 4             about filters during this time period.
 5                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, I object.
 6             It contradicts the findings.
 7                   THE COURT:  Overruled.  That's argument,
 8             Counsel.
 9                   MR. LOMBARDI:  During this time period
10             there was no -- Mr. Skolnick was doing exactly
11             what the public health authorities were saying
12             he should do, which is smoke filtered
13             cigarettes, and that is what he did.
14                   Now, there was a discussion among some of
15             the witnesses about why Mr. Skolnick switched
16             to filtered cigarettes, and Barbara Skolnick
17             said that he had certain information about
18             filters.  He told her about this.
19                   And she said that a filter would take
20             some of the harmful things from cigarettes
21             away.  We've seen that's true.  And that if you
22             were unable to quit smoking, this was your best
23             alternative.
24                   That's what she said her father told her
25             about what he learned and why he switched to

 1             filters.
 2                   But the tobacco companies never said
 3             that.
 4                   You can look through all the documents
 5             that you have back there for as long as you
 6             want to.  You're not going to find something
 7             where a tobacco company said if you're unable
 8             to quit smoking, you should smoke filtered
 9             cigarettes.
10                   Who was saying that?  Well, Dr. Proctor
11             said public health, Surgeon General,
12             physicians, epidemiologists were saying if
13             you're going to smoke, smoke filtered
14             cigarettes.  That's what Dr. Proctor said.
15                   So that's where the information -- that's
16             where the information that Mr. Skolnick had
17             came from.  I think Mrs. Skolnick gave similar
18             testimony at first.
19                   But at the end of her testimony, she said
20             that she knew that this information came from
21             the Surgeon General and others like the Surgeon
22             General.
23                   Now, this testimony that the whole filter
24             point relates to questions 3 and 4 that
25             Mr. Belasic already talked to you about.  It's

 1             in addition to everything he said.  I agree
 2             with everything Mr. Belasic said, and I'm not
 3             going to repeat everything he said about the
 4             1982 date and the other things.
 5                   But what makes this relevant here is, for
 6             instance, in 3, they have to show that each
 7             defendant intentionally omitted material
 8             information concerning the health effects or
 9             addictive nature of smoking cigarettes.
10                   Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds didn't
11             omit -- intentionally omit any material
12             information concerning the health effects.
13                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.
14                   THE COURT:  Overruled.
15                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Now, let me take a minute.
16             One other thing about this.
17                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  May I approach, Judge.
18                   THE COURT:  Yes, sir.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
17                   THE COURT:  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen,
18             let me give you a brief instruction.  To the
19             extent that defense counsel's comments are
20             contrary to the findings that you've been told
21             you must apply in this case should you find
22             that Mr. Skolnick was a member of the class,
23             what we call the Engle findings, you should
24             disregard counsel's statement.
25                   Counsel's statements are only related to

 1             filtered cigarettes.
 2                   You may proceed.
 3                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Yes, Your Honor.
 4                   And so 3 and 4 again, talking about this
 5             before, and obviously I agree with Mr. Belasic,
 6             for the same reasons that he expressed that the
 7             answer there should be no.
 8                   If the answer there is no, then you don't
 9             get down to question 6.  You don't have to go
10             there.  And that's obviously what we think
11             ought to be the outcome here.
12                   But if you do get to question 6, I just
13             want to point out a couple of things about
14             question 6.  Question 6 is the part that
15             counsel said earlier he considers the real part
16             of the case.  The real part he wants to get to
17             with more evidence and more arguments.
18                   And question 6 has special standards in
19             it.  Heightened standards in it.  So if you do
20             get to question 6, look at those heightened
21             standards.  And the heightened standards state
22             that -- I want to make sure I have the words
23             right.  Of course I misplaced it.
24                   But the heightened standard states that
25             you have to be -- have an immediate reaction, a

 1             reaction that it has to be the case, that
 2             question 6 should be answered yes in order to
 3             do so.
 4                   You'll see it's a standard above the
 5             standard that we have been talking about for
 6             the rest of the case.
 7                   And for that reason, in addition to
 8             everything else you've heard, question 6, in
 9             our view, should be answered no.
10                   Firm belief without hesitation.  It has
11             to be a firm belief without hesitation in order
12             to answer question 6 yes.  And I don't think
13             you'll have a firm belief without hesitation.
14             I don't think you'll get to question 6, and
15             that's what we say the outcome should be here.
16                   Now, let me tell you a little bit about
17             Mr. Skolnick.  We haven't talked that much
18             about Marlboro and where Marlboro fits in here.
19             So I want to make sure you know where his
20             smoking of Marlboro fits in.
21                   He didn't start smoking Marlboro until
22             the late 1960s.  By that time, he was in his
23             late 40s, and he'd been smoking for a long
24             time.
25                   Mr. Skolnick did not smoke a Philip

 1             Morris brand until after the 1964 Surgeon
 2             General's report.
 3                   Why is that important?  Because that's
 4             the report that said smoking causes lung cancer
 5             in men.  It was front page news, he knew about
 6             it.
 7                   Every package of Marlboro that he
 8             purchased had a warning label.  The warning
 9             label started in the late 1960s.
10                   So when he started smoking Marlboro, it
11             had a warning label on it.  That warning label
12             changed over time, because there were changes
13             made by Congress in what the warning label
14             said.  But the warning label was there on every
15             pack.  Every pack of Marlboro that he purchased
16             had that.
17                   Mr. Skolnick did not smoke a Philip
18             Morris brand until after he had rejected
19             Mrs. Skolnick's request that he sit down by the
20             television and watch the quit -- the quit
21             program.  Didn't start until after that.
22                   And Mr. Skolnick, as Mr. Belasic has
23             already said, did not rely on any Philip Morris
24             statements, just like he didn't rely on any RJR
25             statements made after 1982.

 1                   And that's the end of the line on 3 and
 2             4.  That's where the May 1982 language is.  So
 3             there's nothing like that with respect to
 4             Mr. Skolnick.
 5                   Now, there's something else about
 6             Marlboro cigarettes and all cigarettes.
 7             Cigarettes always were a legal product and
 8             still are a legal product.  And you can't hold
 9             Philip Morris liable merely for manufacturing,
10             advertising, or selling a cigarette.  You have
11             to have more.
12                   They have to prove more about this
13             particular plaintiff and the smoker in this
14             particular case, Mr. Skolnick.  And they
15             haven't done that.
16                   Now, I'm going to talk about radiation
17             now.  Probably when you came into this case
18             after voir dire, you had no idea we were going
19             to end up talking about radiation in this case.
20                   But radiation is important for two
21             reasons, as I said before.  First, it shows you
22             exactly -- exactly -- why Mrs. Skolnick gave
23             the answers that she gave on the declaration
24             that you've seen already in this case.  She
25             gave it because the radiation was real.  She

 1             gave it because the radiation caused disease,
 2             and she gave it because she was making a claim
 3             to that effect.
 4                   Second, radiation is important because
 5             under question 1 -- question 1 is a question
 6             that Mr. Belasic went through with you, and he
 7             broke it down into about four different
 8             questions.
 9                   One of the questions that is kind of
10             within question 1 is whether Mr. Skolnick's
11             smoking caused the cancer that's at issue.
12             Whether it caused the cancer in the lung that's
13             at issue here.
14                   And so the radiation goes to that.
15                   They have the burden of proving -- they
16             have the burden of proving that the cancer here
17             was caused by smoking.
18                   And the fact of the radiation establishes
19             that they can't meet their burden of proof.  We
20             don't have to prove anything.  They have to
21             prove it.
22                   And so that's where the radiation, the
23             second part, the second reason for talking
24             about radiation, that's why it fits in.  It's
25             there under number 1, and it's an additional

 1             reason for you to answer no, in addition to the
 2             reasons that Mr. Belasic pointed out.
 3                   So, let's talk about radiation.  Let's
 4             start with the basics.  Notwithstanding what
 5             Mr. Schlesinger thinks and what he said in his
 6             argument earlier, everyone agrees that
 7             radiation causes cancer.  Dr. McGregor,
 8             Dr. Burns, Dr. Proctor, Dr. Davis.  Everybody
 9             believes that radiation causes cancer.
10                   And Mr. Schlesinger said in his argument
11             that uranium is not dangerous.  That's not what
12             Dr. Burns said.  Not what Dr. Burns said.  It's
13             an example of the difference between lawyer
14             argument and the actual facts.
15                   Dr. Burns said uranium causes radiation.
16             Radiation causes cancer.  Everybody except
17             perhaps Mr. Schlesinger agrees.  And that's
18             kind of a lesson.
19                   When you hear a lawyer -- and hold me to
20             this too -- when you hear a lawyer state
21             something, make sure that there are facts to
22             back that up.
23                   You are the finders of facts in this
24             case.  You have heard the evidence in this
25             case.  You are the ones that are going to

 1             decide what happened.
 2                   If I say something and it doesn't look
 3             like it's supported by the facts, hold me to
 4             that.  But also hold the plaintiff to that.
 5                   Because when he comes before you and he
 6             raises uranium and he says:  Nobody -- uranium
 7             is not dangerous.  Says who?  Nobody in this
 8             case says uranium is not dangerous except
 9             Mr. Schlesinger.  Every expert says uranium is
10             dangerous.
11                   So where is this Sylvania plant?  This is
12             the Google map that we put up with
13             Dr. McGregor.  It's very similar to the Google
14             map that we put up with Mrs. Skolnick.  And
15             this is the neighborhood.  This is where the
16             site was for the Sylvania plant.  That's where
17             the site was.
18                   And how far was the Skolnicks' house?
19             Well, it was here on Maxwell Drive.
20             Dr. McGregor said she did the Google search and
21             it was about right there.  That distance, when
22             you use the scale on Google Maps, is 500 yards.
23             500 yards.  It is close.
24                   Now, we asked Mrs. Skolnick about the
25             neighborhood a little bit, and Mrs. Skolnick

 1             said:  Yes, that's the neighborhood.  I don't
 2             remember all the street names, she said.
 3                   She said:  This makes it look a lot
 4             closer than it really was.  And she said:  I
 5             had no idea that Sylvania plant was right here.
 6                   That's what Mrs. Skolnick said.  But she
 7             also said -- I think she also said she couldn't
 8             tell you where on Maxwell Drive she actually
 9             lived.  It was on Maxwell Drive, but she
10             couldn't tell you where it really was.
11                   She told you that the temple that she and
12             her husband were founding members of was
13             located right there.  Just down the road from
14             the plant.  She told you that this was a park
15             that her children played in.  Just down the
16             road from the plant.
17                   She told you that there was a golf course
18             right here.
19                   THE CLERK:  You have 24 minutes.
20                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Thank you, sir.
21                   There is a golf course right here where
22             Mr. Skolnick played sometimes, not all the time
23             because he belonged to a private club that was
24             located elsewhere.
25                   There was a golf course right here that

 1             Mr. Skolnick went to, just across the road from
 2             the Sylvania plant.
 3                   But Mrs. Skolnick, her testimony is, she
 4             never saw the plant in 25 years of living in
 5             the neighborhood.  But we have the testimony of
 6             somebody else who lived there for a long time.
 7             Somebody who lived there when Mrs. Skolnick
 8             lived there.
 9                   Do you remember Mrs. Gross?  She was very
10             early in the case, and she's one of
11             Mrs. Skolnick's old friends from Westbury.  She
12             was up here on the witness stand.  She's in her
13             80s, very pleasant.  Affable lady.
14                   And we asked Mrs. Gross:  You lived in
15             this neighborhood?  Do you remember the
16             Sylvania plant?
17                   She said -- Ma'am, you lived across the
18             street from the plant?
19                   Yes.
20                   You lived about the same distance from
21             the plant as the Skolnicks?
22                   Yes.
23                   Well, Mrs. Gross knew about the plant.
24             Mrs. Gross knew about the plant.
25                   So the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen,

 1             is that plant was close.  Whether Mrs. Skolnick
 2             knew it was there or doesn't know it was there,
 3             that plant was close by.
 4                   And it was close enough that there would
 5             be problems if there was something going on at
 6             that plant that shouldn't have been going on at
 7             that plant.
 8                   And so you heard the story of the
 9             Sylvania plant, and you heard that story from
10             Dr. McGregor.  I'll talk more about her in a
11             minute.
12                   But it really is an extraordinary story.
13             Who knew that in the suburbs of the United
14             States you could have a nuclear processing
15             plant?
16                   The Skolnicks didn't know.  I don't think
17             anybody in that neighborhood knew.  Who knew
18             that?  But it was in a different era.  It was
19             back in the Cold War when we were in this arms
20             race with the Russians.  We needed to make
21             nuclear weapons.
22                   So they were making nuclear fuel rods.
23             And what were they using to make it?  They were
24             making it out of uranium.  And, yes, they were
25             making it out of enriched uranium.

 1                   Mr. Schlesinger got up and said to you
 2             there was no enriched uranium there.  There's
 3             fact and there's argument.
 4                   Dr. McGregor told you there was enriched
 5             uranium there.  The documents show there was
 6             enriched uranium there, and also shows there
 7             were other hazardous substances there.  Nickel,
 8             beryllium, thorium.
 9                   When you're working with nuclear fuel
10             rods, you are working with some nasty things.
11             They go in nuclear weapons, they make bombs.
12             So you're working with some nasty things.
13                   And what else did Dr. McGregor tell you?
14             That when you work with this uranium to make it
15             into fuel rods, you mill it, you lathe it, you
16             shape it.
17                   That means you create scraps, you create
18             scrap material, scrap uranium.  What are you
19             going to do with the scrap uranium?  She told
20             you that at first -- this was really amazing, I
21             thought.
22                   She told you at first they sent it to
23             New Jersey in these big drums, and then they
24             took it off the coast of New Jersey and dropped
25             them in the ocean somewhere, and then they said

 1             that is not a good idea.
 2                   So what did they do?  They burned the
 3             uranium.  They burned the uranium inside the
 4             plant where it would go out a smokestack, they
 5             burned the uranium outside the plant in the
 6             yard, and that's in addition to what happened
 7             to the uranium that sat in the drums.
 8                   This uranium that Mr. Schlesinger says is
 9             not dangerous, it spontaneously combusts.  It
10             catches on fire.  There are accounts of a drum
11             of uranium being in the yard and the lid
12             blowing off and the thing catching on fire
13             without anybody doing anything to it.
14                   Argument, fact.
15                   The barrels of uranium were stored
16             outside and spontaneously caught on fire.
17             That's how dangerous this stuff is.
18                   They had extensive safety procedures, and
19             Dr. McGregor went through this.  They had
20             respirators, they had incinerators, they had
21             gloves, they had film badges.  This was the
22             real deal.  This was the real dangerous stuff.
23             In a New York suburb.  Who would have known?
24                   And Dr. McGregor talked about the
25             smokestacks.  She told you about what was the

 1             size of this building.
 2                   So the Sylvania plant was actually a
 3             one-story building.  It wasn't a big
 4             skyscraper.  It was a one-story building.
 5             Which is what you would probably expect if it's
 6             in a suburban neighborhood.  And it didn't have
 7             a 200-foot smokestack to take the smoke up and
 8             out and as far away as possible.
 9                   The smokestacks for the -- for the
10             outside was 10 feet, and for the inside burning
11             was 20 feet.  Something like the ceiling, a
12             little higher than that, with a 10 foot.  And
13             that's where the smoke from the burning uranium
14             went, about that high.
15                   Where's it gonna go?  It's gonna go to
16             the neighborhood.  That's where it did go.
17                   There was also contamination at the time
18             in the water at the plant, in what they call
19             the sumps, in the leach pools.
20                   You saw a document that Dr. McGregor
21             specifically directed you to where they had a
22             measurement of dispersal of 1100 DPMs per M3,
23             which she told you was something on the
24             order -- multiple, multiple times, over the
25             standards that existed at the time.

 1                   And you heard her say that there was --
 2             at the Atomic Energy Commission, which looked
 3             at this plant, which inspected this plant, told
 4             them frequently, you're not keeping good enough
 5             records.  You're not keeping on top of things.
 6                   So that's what was going on at that
 7             plant.  That's what was going on at that plant.
 8                   Over the course of the time that it was
 9             working with uranium, 6 to 13 million pounds of
10             uranium went through that plant in suburban
11             New York.
12                   And a lot of it got burned, because every
13             time they worked with it, they made the scraps.
14             And when they made the scraps, they had to burn
15             it.  And when they had to burn it, they made
16             the smoke, and in the smoke were uranium
17             particles.
18                   And when there's smoke that has uranium
19             particles and the uranium particles get in the
20             lungs, you heard Dr. McGregor say that is a
21             serious health problem.  And lung cancer is a
22             serious risk.
23                   So that's what was happening.  That's
24             what was happening at that plant.
25                   And it was so bad at that plant that even

 1             today, at the same site, there's still
 2             contamination.  There's still uranium there.
 3                   You heard about the 1990s, the Nuclear
 4             Regulatory Commission said that there was
 5             radioactive contamination there then.
 6                   You heard in 2000 that there was cleanup
 7             of a site that began, that there was still a
 8             significant amount of radioactive materials.
 9             What is this, like 35 years after the last time
10             they used uranium at the plant?
11                   2001, they did more investigations, and
12             this is the 2005 Army Corps of Engineers report
13             which you saw and is in evidence in this case
14             which talks about all of these things.
15                   So the uranium at the plant -- what is
16             the fact?  What is not the argument?  What is
17             the fact?  It was dangerous.  It's still
18             dangerous.  That site is still dangerous.
19                   Now we're something like 50 years later.
20             Uranium is dangerous.  And the facts -- not the
21             argument, the fact -- tell you that.
22                   Now, let's talk about Dr. McGregor.  I
23             was interested in the argument about
24             Dr. McGregor's qualifications this morning.
25             Counsel said that Dr. McGregor is completely

 1             unqualified.  She's not like one of the great
 2             men of science, he said.  Completely
 3             unqualified, he said.
 4                   Dr. McGregor was corrupt.  He said that.
 5             And why did he say that?
 6                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
 7                   THE COURT:  Sustained.
 8                   Let's talk about something else, Counsel.
 9                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Dr. McGregor's
10             qualifications were called into question.  And
11             the fact is, you got to see Dr. McGregor.  The
12             fact is that Dr. McGregor was the single most
13             qualified person to come in this courtroom to
14             talk about radiation and to talk about what
15             happened at the Sylvania plant.
16                   She's a medical doctor, just like
17             Dr. Burns.  She has a master's of public
18             health.  She specializes in environmental and
19             occupational medicine.  Dr. Burns does not.
20             Nobody else in this case does.
21                   When you specialize in occupational and
22             environmental medicine, you are dealing with
23             exposures to dangerous substances.  That's what
24             you do.  That's what she does.
25                   And you heard that she actually was one

 1             of the very first doctors to ever work on the
 2             EEOICP -- and I think I got all those letters
 3             in the right order.
 4                   But that is the program she told you
 5             about that she works on, where they deal with
 6             these kinds of nuclear reactor plants, and they
 7             determine whether people have suffered
 8             exposures and whether they deserve compensation
 9             for those exposures.
10                   She is more familiar with this kind of
11             plant than anybody who set foot in this
12             courtroom.  And to call her unqualified without
13             a fact to support it is outrageous.
14                   Argument, fact.  The most qualified
15             witness in this case.
16                   Dr. Burns, has he ever -- Dr. Burns, I
17             admit, has done a lot of things in this career.
18             But has he ever done this kind of work?  No
19             evidence.  No evidence that he did.  And the
20             evidence in this case of what Dr. Burns
21             actually did is pretty shocking.
22                   So let's look.
23                   Dr. McGregor's materials reviewed.  She
24             told you that she went through a huge quantity
25             of materials in this case.  She went through

 1             Atomic Energy Commission, Nuclear Regulatory
 2             Commission.  All of these reports, she went
 3             through them to try to understand what happened
 4             at this plant.
 5                   The 2010 Army Corps of Engineers report.
 6             She told you that alone, 6,000 pages long.
 7             6,000 pages long.  So she went out there.  She
 8             not only has expertise in this area, she did
 9             the work to make sure that she could come in
10             and tell you what happened at this plant.
11                   Fact, argument.
12                   What did Dr. Burns do?  And I actually
13             don't blame Dr. Burns for this.  But what did
14             Dr. Burns do?  What documents did Dr. Burns
15             look at in this case?
16                   Dr. McGregor looked at all of these.
17             Dr. Burns looked at one of them.  He looked at
18             the 2005 Army Corps of Engineers report.  He
19             didn't look at the 6000-page document.  He
20             didn't look at the other documents.  He didn't
21             do the work to be able to tell you what
22             happened at that plant.  And whether radiation
23             at that plant got into the neighborhood.  He
24             hadn't done that work.
25                   But I said I don't blame him for that.

 1             Because I asked him, when he was up there on
 2             the witness stand, where he got the documents
 3             he relied on, he got them from plaintiff's
 4             attorneys.  He took the documents that he got
 5             from plaintiff's attorneys and worked with
 6             them.
 7                   So Dr. Burns, if you take a great expert
 8             and you don't give them the information he
 9             needs, he's not reliable.  Doesn't matter how
10             many credentials he has.  You have to give him
11             the information he needs.
12                   They didn't give Dr. Burns the
13             information, and I'm going to show you why.
14                   Look at the things that Dr. Burns didn't
15             know about.  He didn't know what work was done
16             at the plant.  He didn't know -- you remember,
17             you might have heard the word "pyrophoric."  We
18             talked about that a couple times.
19                   I asked him what it meant.  That's what
20             it means when you spontaneously combust.  Pyro
21             for fire, and blown up.  He didn't know what
22             the word meant.  He didn't know that uranium
23             spontaneously combusts.
24                   There's another fact about uranium.
25             Uranium not dangerous, argument.  Fact, uranium

 1             spontaneously combusts.
 2                   How was uranium processed at the plant?
 3             He didn't know.  How was scrap uranium created?
 4             He didn't know.  Did the burning uranium create
 5             smoke?  He did not know.
 6                   That's the way Dr. McGregor said the
 7             contamination got into the neighborhoods that
 8             got to people like Leo Skolnick.  That's
 9             burning uranium.  He did not know.
10                   THE CLERK:  You have nine minutes left.
11                   MR. LOMBARDI:  How much?
12                   THE CLERK:  Nine.
13                   MR. LOMBARDI:  I think I lied about the
14             timing.
15                   Dr. Burns didn't know.  He wasn't given
16             the information.  Dr. McGregor was.  She told
17             you that the plant created uranium, that
18             particles of uranium got into the neighborhood;
19             that the uranium contamination was sufficient
20             to cause Mr. Skolnick's colon cancer, and to be
21             a risk factor for Mr. Skolnick's lung cancer.
22                   And she is -- nobody disputes her.
23             Nobody that has knowledge in this case disputes
24             her.
25                   There's more here.

 1                   What does that leave you, by the way, if
 2             Dr. Burns was their only expert to talk about
 3             this, and he doesn't know what's left?  Well,
 4             what is left is argument.
 5                   But argument is not fact.
 6                   So let's go to the next point.
 7                   Colon cancer.  This is an interesting
 8             thing.  Colon cancer, Mr. Skolnick had colon
 9             cancer.  Well, did they bring Dr. Burns in to
10             tell you what the colon cancer was caused by?
11             Well, he said it wasn't caused by smoking.  And
12             he -- again, he was not asked to form an
13             opinion about what caused the colon cancer.
14                   The plaintiffs did not ask him to form an
15             opinion about colon cancer.  What caused it?
16             What was the evidence?
17                   There's no treating physician testimony.
18             They haven't provided any treating physician
19             testimony on what caused the colon cancer.
20             There are no medical records showing the cause
21             of the colon cancer.
22                   Dr. Burns does not know what caused
23             Mr. Skolnick's colon cancer.  Said it couldn't
24             have been smoking.  There is no information
25             from that side.

 1                   So who is the only person to talk about
 2             it, Dr. McGregor.  And she testified that
 3             Mr. Skolnick's only risk factor for colon
 4             cancer was radiation.  That's the only risk
 5             factor.
 6                   She said to a reasonable degree of
 7             medical probability, if the only risk factor is
 8             radiation, then she says that's the cause of
 9             the colon cancer.
10                   How does that relate to the lung cancer
11             in this case?  There was enough radiation to
12             cause Mr. Skolnick's colon cancer.
13                   The radiation is a risk factor for lung
14             cancer.  There was enough radiation to cause
15             the lung cancer.  If there's enough radiation
16             to cause the colon cancer, there's enough
17             radiation to cause the lung cancer.
18                   And interestingly, the cell type for the
19             colon cancer was an adenocarcinoma.  Same cell
20             type for the lung cancer.
21                   So when you have two risk factors for a
22             lung cancer, you can't determine the cause just
23             by looking at the cancer through a microscope.
24             That's what Dr. Burns told us.
25                   You can't determine which of the risk

 1             factors caused the lung cancer.  That's what
 2             Dr. McGregor told us right there.
 3                   So what does she say?  She says:  Colon
 4             cancer was caused by the radiation.
 5                   I can't tell you for sure about the lung
 6             cancer.  But there were two risk factors.
 7             There was smoking, and there was radiation.
 8             And you can't tell which one caused the lung
 9             cancer.  You can't tell that.
10                   Now, plaintiff put up -- this is another
11             fact thing.  Plaintiff put up something, they
12             said:  Look, Dr. McGregor agrees that smoking
13             cigarettes was one of the causes of the
14             smoking -- one of the contributing causes of
15             the smoking.
16                   He said:  See, that's it.  That proves
17             it.  It's admitting that the smoking caused the
18             cancer.
19                   Well, you got to look at the whole
20             question.  And to the extent that it is true in
21             this case -- he's asking her to assume that.
22             That wasn't her testimony.
23                   Her testimony was that the lung cancer --
24             there are two risk factors, and you can't
25             unwind those risk factors to make a

 1             determination.
 2                   So can they carry their burden of proof
 3             concerning the cause of lung cancer?  The
 4             answer to that is no.
 5                   Not when the radiation is in the
 6             neighborhood.  Not when the only expert who did
 7             the work and had actual expertise in the area
 8             has said that uranium contamination caused the
 9             colon cancer and so forth.
10                   The answer is no, they haven't -- they
11             can't sustain their burden of proof when the
12             treating physicians -- counsel gets up and
13             says:  All these treating physicians, they said
14             that smoking was the cause of lung cancer?
15                   That's true.  Not one of them knew about
16             the radiation.  Not one of them had any reason
17             to know about the radiation.
18                   So, of course, they're going to say the
19             only risk factor was smoking.  That was the
20             cause.  They didn't know about the radiation.
21             They didn't know what you know, they didn't
22             know what Dr. McGregor knows.
23                   And they can't sustain the burden of
24             proof when Mrs. Skolnick, the plaintiff, files
25             an affidavit under oath in another case against

 1             another defendant where she says that the lung
 2             cancer was caused by radiation.
 3                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
 4             I move -- I would like to approach.
 5                   THE COURT:  Okay.
 6                   (The following discussion was held at
 7                   sidebar:)
 8                   THE COURT:  I think there are two
 9             reasonable interpretations of the document, and
10             I'm going to allow both of parties to argue
11             what this means.
12                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is when she says
13             it was caused by radiation.  The word is not on
14             the page.
15                   THE COURT:  Okay.
16                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  The word is -- he can
17             say she thought it was.  But he said "she
18             said," and that's her handwritten statement.
19             And then I don't have enough time to go and
20             unravel things that are past the pale.  That is
21             flat-out misstatement.
22                   THE COURT:  I'm not sure --
23                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Flat-out.
24                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Judge, that is a
25             reasonable interpretation of this document.

 1             She was filing a claim for radiation, and
 2             that's what it --
 3                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Where does it say
 4             radiation?  The word "radiation" --
 5                   THE COURT:  Relax, please, sir.  Relax.
 6                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm sorry, Judge.
 7                   The word "Radiation" doesn't appear on
 8             the document.
 9                   THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain.
10             Rephrase the question in terms of it was
11             related to the -- whatever happened at the
12             plant.  Okay?  That's all I'm going to say.
13                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  You'll instruct the
14             jury --
15                   THE COURT:  No, sir.
16                   (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
17                   following was held in open court:)
18                   THE COURT:  Go ahead, sir.
19                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Yes, Your Honor.
20                   And so Mrs. Skolnick gave these answers
21             to questions concerning what happened at the
22             Sylvania plant.  She said that the lung cancer
23             was caused by what happened at the Sylvania
24             plant and it wasn't just once.
25                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Same objection, Judge.

 1                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Wasn't twice.
 2                   THE COURT:  I'm sorry?
 3                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Same objection.
 4                   THE COURT:  Overruled.  I'm going to
 5             allow it.
 6                   MR. LOMBARDI:  You see the number of
 7             times that she filled in "lung cancer" in that
 8             declaration.
 9                   Now, Mrs. Skolnick today says that she
10             read the declaration in a different way, she
11             didn't know what wrongful death claim meant,
12             she didn't know a lot of different things about
13             this.
14                   But I suggest that if you consider what's
15             going on here, a lot of these answers become
16             clear.  Why it was that the neighborhood was
17             fuzzy in her mind, why it was that Mrs. Gross
18             recognized where the Sylvania plant was and she
19             didn't.
20                   In one case she swore that the lung
21             cancer was caused by what went on in that case
22             against a different defendant.
23                   In this case she comes in and swears that
24             the lung cancer is caused by smoking.  You
25             can't sustain your burden of proving that the

 1             lung cancer was caused by smoking when you have
 2             sworn and made a claim that the lung cancer was
 3             caused by rad -- was caused by what happened at
 4             the Sylvania plant.  You can't sustain your
 5             burden of proof.
 6                   They have the burden of proof, and this
 7             is question 1.  The answer should be no.
 8                   Dr. McGregor's evidence indicates that,
 9             Mrs. Skolnick's evidence indicates that.
10                   And when counsel has said that this --
11             this is just something the tobacco companies
12             came up with, remember Mrs. Skolnick filed the
13             declaration, Mrs. Skolnick completed the
14             declaration, and Mrs. Skolnick, so there's no
15             confusion, had access to lawyers in New York.
16                   She has a son who is a lawyer, and the
17             last little clip that we played that led --
18             that one minute and 13 second deposition,
19             probably the happiest you've been about a
20             deposition in this whole case, she said that
21             she gave the claim form to her son, and he took
22             it to his office.  And she said that was just
23             to mail it.
24                   But you're entitled to weigh the
25             credibility and to consider all the facts when

 1             you consider this declaration and when you
 2             consider whether they can meet their burden of
 3             proof that the smoking caused the lung cancer
 4             here.
 5                   Now --
 6                   THE CLERK:  One minute left.
 7                   MR. LOMBARDI:  I won't be here long.
 8                   Thank you again.  Now, as Mr. Belasic
 9             said, we're not going to be able to talk from
10             here on.  You can imagine with lawyers, you've
11             seen how much we talk.  You see how we all want
12             to have the last word, and you know that we're
13             going to be frustrated.  That's the way it
14             goes.  They have the burden of proof.  They go
15             last.
16                   But I ask you to remember when you only
17             hear one side of the story, you don't always
18             hear the facts.  You don't always hear
19             everything.
20                   When you hear one side of the story, you
21             might hear the argument.  But you don't hear
22             all the facts.
23                   I ask you to help us by keeping that in
24             mind and asking questions in your own mind when
25             counsel gets up to close the case.

 1                   So, again, thank you for your patience,
 2             thank you for paying attention in the middle of
 3             the afternoon to the last guy getting up, and
 4             thanks for your service.
 5                   Thank you very much.
