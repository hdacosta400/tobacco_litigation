 3                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Counsel; Ms. Skolnick.
 4                     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, good
 5               morning.
 6                     I am not unmindful and --
 7                     We, as the members of the court
 8               personnel -- and I'm talking about the lawyers
 9               that represent their respective clients, and
10               I'm talking about our clerk, our bailiff, our
11               fine Judge, our "carpal tunnel developing"
12               court reporters -- are all mindful of the
13               difference in what it is that the experience of
14               this trial means from our perspective as from
15               your perspective.  So today I'm going to try to
16               take some time --
17                     And it's not enough time to cover a
18               hundred years of history, it's not enough time
19               to talk about what the world was like in 1918,
20               when Leo Skolnick was born, when women were
21               just getting to vote in 1918, where Florida was
22               a sandbar, with a few outposts, it's not enough
23               time to do it all, so we have to try to
24               simplify it.  But I'm not --
25                     We are not unmindful -- and I speak, I

 1               believe, for defense counsel, as well -- that
 2               things get tedious, and it comes to a point in
 3               time where, as they say, that a great
 4               percentage of human communication -- we're
 5               human beings, we interact with each other -- is
 6               non-verbal.  It isn't just what you say; it's
 7               your body language, it's your body position.
 8               And you were telling us, at least I interpreted
 9               it, that we've heard enough, give us this case.
10               And we respect that.
11                     So let me try to make some arguments to
12               you.  Let me try to stitch this together a
13               little bit in a way that gives our perspective
14               from some of the evidence that was there, hope
15               you'll continue to be patient with us,
16               recognizing that, for us, the most important
17               part of this case is yet to be tried before you
18               all, and we have to prove our case to you in a
19               satisfactory way, and then you have to embrace
20               that duty that you've discharged thus far so
21               willingly to continue on if the evidence
22               justifies it.
23                     And what I'm talking about is an industry
24               that has perpetrated an extraordinarily great
25               wrong on our society for decades.

 1                     We live in a world that is still
 2               suffering the scourge of a tobacco epidemic
 3               that kills indiscriminately in a generation of
 4               people that are the grandparents and parents of
 5               our current generation and in a way that has
 6               not been fully corrected.
 7                     So there are numbers that you've heard.
 8               We'll talk about some of them, but some of the
 9               numbers you've heard.  A number they love -- a
10               number they love -- 50 million.  Fifty million
11               smokers have quit.
12                     A number they hate, 44 million people
13               continue to smoke.  A number they hate, 443,000
14               Americans every single year die from the
15               ravages of the tobacco epidemic that we have in
16               our country.  And of those near half a million
17               Americans who die, many of whom were addicted
18               in the '30s and the '40s and the '50s, before
19               folks had an understanding, a full
20               conceptualization in any real way of what
21               smoking was.
22                     Physicians were advertising it as being
23               healthy for you.  The most glamorous movie
24               stars of the day were hawking cigarettes.  And
25               you heard how many of those folks, despite

 1               being paid to do so, succumbed to the deadly
 2               diseases of the actual product they were using.
 3                     Conceptually, it is so difficult, and it
 4               takes a long time -- only because of our own
 5               experience as lawyers in this case -- it takes
 6               such a long time to understand that this
 7               (indicating) is only one thing.  It's only one
 8               thing.
 9                     This is drugs.  This is addictive drugs.
10               Whether it was a drug sold illegally on a
11               street corner, a cocaine drug --
12 Objection, your Honor.
13                     THE COURT:  Sustained.  Counsel, let's
14               stick to the facts of this case, okay?
15                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  As the Surgeon General
16               said, the drugs in these products are as
17               addictive as heroin and cocaine.  That is a
18               scientific fact.
19                     There is no smoking without nicotine.
20               This is a nicotine-delivery device.  But what
21               does it look like?  It looks like a normal
22               consumer product.  A totally normal consumer
23               product.  It's got --
24                     Nowadays, it's got every imaginable color
25               under the sun.  This looks like a Creamsicle.

 1               Every imaginable color under the sun.  And
 2               it's, as Dr. Proctor testified, normalized.  We
 3               look at it --
 4                     If you go into a 7-Eleven, if you go into
 5               a CVS pharmacy, it appears to be in a package
 6               that's designed and pretty in colors and
 7               letters and what have you, like a million
 8               similarly sized products, little boxes of candy
 9               and things like that.
10                     And who are the only customers that the
11               tobacco industry targets and sells to, to
12               maintain their business?  It's children.
13                     Now, that is the dirty little secret that
14               exists for decades and decades, that when you
15               were selected amongst a huge group of potential
16               jurors, all of you all came in and everyone
17               talked about what they knew about cigarettes,
18               because cigarettes has touched all of our
19               lives.
20                     The culture in which we live is a culture
21               that was saturated by cigarette advertising,
22               marketing, and the emergence of a consumer
23               culture in our country in the industrial ages
24               of the '20s, to the '30s, to the '40s, the
25               '50s, and the '60s, and we are now immersed in

 1               it and saturated in it.
 2                     And, as His Honor told you,
 3               Mr. Skolnick's reliance can be inferred from
 4               what everybody did; what Mr. Skolnick did in
 5               being your typical, generic smoker of that era,
 6               who began at such a young age, so dependent
 7               upon the nicotine in cigarettes so long before
 8               there was actually a warning on a label that
 9               would obligate him to change his behavior,
10               despite the fact that even in the face of the
11               warning, the tobacco companies embarked on a
12               powerful campaign to confuse and cause doubt,
13               and they would call out, let's get headlines
14               planted in the newspapers that say, in the
15               headline, controversy, doubt, unproven, other
16               factors, undetermined, to give smokers the
17               psychological crutch to keep smoking.
18                     And then they put filters as a health
19               reassurance campaign; and then filters went
20               from zero percent of the market to nearly a
21               hundred percent of the market, and smoking
22               continued to go up, and the cancer, made by the
23               filters that were fraudulent all along, never
24               worked, were designed in a way to give smokers
25               a psychological crutch to keep smoking.

 1                     These are drugs.  I will show you the
 2               documents.  It's a nicotine-delivery system.
 3               The pack of cigarettes is to be --
 4                     We are a highly stylized segment of the
 5               pharmaceutical community.  We better watch out
 6               what we say about it, because we could come
 7               under Food and Drug Administration regulation.
 8                     Now, we're going to talk about things
 9               like choice, opportunity, motivation, control;
10               but what's very important to remember is, step
11               one is about belonging to a group, a class, a
12               proud class, a group that, when I think about
13               it -- and you'll see these -- these -- the
14               findings, the determination, the blood, sweat
15               and tears, the decades of litigation that
16               resulted --
17 Objection, Your Honor.
18                     THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.  Let's
19               talk about this case, okay?
20                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  This case is an Engle
21               progeny case.  It is the emergence and it is
22               the offspring of a case that was tried for a
23               lengthy period of time.
24 Objection, Your Honor.
25                     THE COURT:  Overruled.  I'm going to

 1               allow that.
 2                     Go ahead.
 3                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Many years ago, a
 4               lawsuit filed in '94, tried in the year 1999,
 5               findings approved by the Florida Supreme Court
 6               as if you found them yourself --
 7 Objection, Your Honor,
 8               "approved by the Florida Supreme Court," Your
 9               Honor.
10                     THE COURT:  Sustained -- sustained,
11               counsel.  Let's just talk about the Engle
12               findings, if we could, sir.
13                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  We'll talk --
14                     Leave those up for a second.
15                     But today, even though you've seen
16               enough, heard enough, your body language tells
17               us you're ready to go, you're going to --
18                     You've honored your duty.  I know you're
19               going to give us the attention we need to give
20               us the chance to get to the important -- super
21               important part of this case, Phase II, based on
22               the reprehensibility of the conduct.  Is the
23               conduct reprehensible, did it evince, did it
24               show a reckless disregard, a lack of caring
25               about people, so that knowing harm would occur,

 1               a company did it anyway.
 2                     Now, it's a company.  There's an
 3               instruction.  The instruction says a
 4               corporation gets to be treated like a person.
 5               They are entitled to be treated in this
 6               courtroom like a person.  That's good for a
 7               number of reasons.
 8                     Because outside the courtroom, they are
 9               not equal, they don't have the same sort of
10               power as an individual.  They have a great deal
11               more power economically, politically, legally,
12               and you'll see the documents that support it.
13                     So I think of them as a really big
14               person.  If you ever drive on US-27, there are
15               those gigantic metal racks where the power
16               lines go, and when we're driving by them, I
17               tell my kids, what is that?  That's the giant
18               man because it looks like a really giant man.
19                     So, if they're a person, they're a really
20               big person; but if they're being treated here
21               equally in a courtroom, it's because, in a
22               courtroom, a jury -- six folks, you guys -- get
23               to treat them equally.
24                     My client, Mrs. Skolnick, 86 years old,
25               lost her husband in 1993.  She gets to stand on

 1               equal footing with them, and she's able to go
 2               toe to toe with them because they have a jury
 3               here as what we call a great equalizer.
 4                     Let's see Thomas Jefferson.  Red, white,
 5               blue.  Inspirational closing argument suit.
 6               Red, white and blue flag, just to inspire us to
 7               think a little bit about, you know, what we're
 8               all about.
 9                     Thomas Jefferson said that trial by jury
10               is the best of all safeguards for the person
11               and property of every individual.
12                     And the fact of the matter is, is that,
13               you know, there are books being written now
14               called The Death of the American Trial, because
15               the trial by jury is a --
16 Objection, Your Honor.
17                     THE COURT:  That's beyond --
18                     Just argue the case.
19                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  So the --
20                     The first conceptualization that folks
21               need to start thinking about, and we hope
22               that --
23                     When you were jurors, you came in, you
24               knew what you knew about cigarettes, to the
25               extent you knew something about cigarettes.  We

 1               hope that the evidence you saw about the
 2               conduct and activities of what the cigarette
 3               industry did, what an industry, treated as a
 4               person, is obligated to behave in the moral and
 5               ethical fashions as all people, if you would
 6               like an instruction that allows us to treat you
 7               like a person, the important thing to do is act
 8               like a person.
 9                     And how do we act like a person?  We are
10               decent to each other.  We are moral to each
11               other.
12 Objection, Your Honor, it's
13               beyond the law and the facts in this case.
14                     THE COURT:  I think it's a legitimate
15               argument.
16                     You can go ahead, sir.
17                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  So let's put up the --
18                     Here's the instruction.  Both are persons
19               in the eyes of the law.  No problem.  If you
20               want the rights of the person, you have the
21               obligations of the person.  The obligations of
22               the person are act like a person, be decent to
23               each other.
24                     Everything I ever needed to learn, I
25               learned in kindergarten.  Robert Fulghum's

 1               book, the title, itself, tells you what you
 2               need to know.  Be decent, don't hurt each
 3               other, don't lie.
 4                     And so we're here to try to correct a
 5               great wrong.
 6                     Show the reckless disregard and the
 7               punitive damage instructions.
 8                     In order to get there, you're going to
 9               have to work through a bunch of questions on
10               the verdict form, which I'm going to work
11               through with you, but I want to talk about the
12               punitive damages.
13                     And if you find that the unearthing of
14               the documents that occurred in the year 2000,
15               that if you look at the Surgeon General '12
16               report, and I --
17                     I had those books.  These are in
18               evidence.  Everything you want to know about
19               this case, almost everything we talked about,
20               is documented in one way or another in these
21               books in evidence.
22                     It is the highest statement by the
23               highest public health officials in our land;
24               and we were honored --
25                     It was a proud honor to bring into this

 1               courtroom giants in the field that dedicated
 2               their lives to trying to make this country a
 3               safer place from the scourge of tobacco
 4               addiction.  An epidemic that is enduring
 5               because a powerful industry depends on its
 6               perpetuation.
 7                     Without nicotine, there is no smoking.
 8               Nobody has become a smoker without smoking
 9               nicotine.
10                     Our customers die.
11                     Now, what is it about the cigarettes --
12               and I tried to think about this --
13                     I tried to think about this in terms of
14               human nature, what are we as people.  Maybe it
15               is that when something doesn't immediately kill
16               you -- it's not a bullet, it's not a gun, it's
17               not one of these outrageous spasms of -- of
18               irrepressible violence that we see in our news
19               that makes headline news, it's not the kind of
20               things that rivet our nation for days on end
21               and days at a time, that we don't -- it doesn't
22               affect us the same way.
23                     I guess the human behavioral survival
24               instinct is if something doesn't kill you right
25               away, or it doesn't hurt you immediately, you

 1               don't perceive the risk of it.
 2                     Well, that makes for the elements of what
 3               is the perfect storm for an epidemic.  Little
 4               kids, 12-year-olds --
 5                     This is the first document I carried
 6               around.  I've been carrying this around.
 7                     Do we have this one?  This is one of
 8               their analyses.  They have code words.
 9               Compound W is nicotine.  Zephyr, a warm breeze?
10               The cynicism that "zephyr" means lung cancer in
11               their secret documents.  The chilling, ghastly
12               things that human beings, men of science --
13                     What could these men, what could the
14               Claude Teagues and the Dunns, and the CEOs,
15               what could they have done if they had dedicated
16               their lives to pursuing good and cancer cures?
17                     What could they have done if -- when, in
18               the '50s, they discovered our product kills
19               people, there is no doubt about it?
20                     They said to the public, if there's
21               something bad, we will take it out.  We would
22               never sell anything bad to you.  Your health,
23               the public's health, is our tantamount
24               responsibility.  And it was --
25                     It was a Madison Avenue, Hill & Knowlton

 1               public relations gambit to put away the cancer
 2               scare that came out in the '50s.  And, sure
 3               enough, cigarette sales shot up.  And more than
 4               half of the men in the country were smoking
 5               because they knew that nicotine is the sine qua
 6               non of smoking.  What does that mean?  It's
 7               Latin.  It means without which there is
 8               nothing.
 9                     Now, this is a business plan.  If I'm
10               sitting in my house and my neighbor comes over
11               to me and says, hey, I got a great idea for a
12               business, we're going to make this product,
13               people are going to eat it up like hotcakes,
14               they're not going to be able to get enough of
15               it, they're never going to be able to stop
16               using it and we are going to make a ton of
17               money.
18                     There's only one problem.  After a while,
19               a lot of people are going to die from it, it's
20               going to kill them; but, man, we're going to
21               make a lot of money.
22                     Would you do it?  Would you do it?  Would
23               somebody enter into that kind of --
24 Objection, Your Honor --
25                     THE COURT:  Sustained.

 1 -- Golden Rule.
 2                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
 3                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Would a person do it?
 4               Judging by a person.
 5                     So we're going to talk about this.  This
 6               document talks about 12-year-olds.
 7               Twelve-year-olds.
 8                     There's a movie, The Big Lebowski.  There
 9               is a line in the movie that John, the big guy,
10               along with Jeff --
11                     You may have never seen it.  Anyway,
12               they're talking, they say 12-year-olds, Dude,
13               12-year-olds, okay?
14                     Now, that -- that is -- that is
15               unacceptable, that is abusive, that is
16               intolerable conduct to children, to
17               recognize -- to do the science and recognize
18               that the teenage brain, the pediatric brain is
19               in a growth spurt, just like the rest of the
20               body, and those frontal lobes are forming, and
21               that it is in those adolescent years that the
22               brain is uniquely and critically susceptible to
23               addiction and a permanent hooking by a drug,
24               nicotine, from which these Surgeon General
25               reports will tell you 3800 kids today --

 1                     The Surgeon General report in 2012, 3800
 2               kids today will begin the smoking habit.  Two
 3               of the three will continue to smoke, and one of
 4               those two will die.
 5                     Twelve million people have died thus far
 6               just in the last 50 years in the United States
 7               from smoking cigarettes.
 8                     The filters they put on the cigarettes to
 9               reassure the public, knowing full well they
10               didn't work, knowing full well they were a
11               fraud, were done to get folks to rely -- to
12               keep people smoking, and it worked.
13                     Now, 99 percent of all cigarettes are
14               filters.  Mr. Skolnick smoked filtered
15               cigarettes in reliance on that fact.
16                     There was a pervasive overwhelming period
17               of years where they fooled the Federal Trade
18               Commission.  They fooled Dr. Burns.
19                     What an honor to get Dr. Burns here.  The
20               man was, essentially, the chief science
21               office -- officer for the Surgeon General.  And
22               Dr. Proctor.  These men are, in their field,
23               giants.
24                     I don't know if you've ever heard of
25               TEDTalks or anything like that; but nowadays,

 1               in our modern world, you can go to the TED
 2               lectures on the Internet and see smarty-pants
 3               guys talking about a bunch of really cool stuff
 4               and teaching us.  And getting these guys in
 5               here is a fantastic thing.
 6                     Now, they were cross-examined on things
 7               like money; they were cross-examined on did you
 8               meet with the lawyers.  Well, any good lawyer
 9               meets with the witness before he puts him on;
10               otherwise, what kind of lawyer would you be?
11                     But it wasn't until you heard
12               Dr. McGregor come in that you knew that, yeah,
13               they met with Dr. McGregor.  They met with
14               Dr. McGregor more times, over more hours than
15               anybody else combined in the whole case.
16                     So you take the evidence as you find it,
17               you hear what the truth is about cigarettes.
18               And the fact of the matter is, is there's a
19               couple of pillars of extraordinary wrongdoing
20               that give rise to the concept that they should
21               be punished.  They should be punished not just
22               for what they did to Mr. Skolnick; but as the
23               instruction will say, the harm they caused
24               others.
25                     So, the Engle year-long trial that

 1               resulted in those findings that you must accept
 2               as your own is super important.  We'll talk
 3               about those.  But we also gave you a window
 4               into what was really going on behind the scenes
 5               in the world of tobacco, and what -- how they
 6               effectuated this ghastly business plan, and
 7               intending to keep it secret, and successfully
 8               did for many, many years, only in 2000 or so,
 9               to have it forced into the public light so that
10               you all could see it.
11                     Now, I want to go back to the -- the
12               Teague -- the last one.
13                     No, no, the last one with the red,
14               please.  The last one.  You had it up a minute
15               ago.  No; but you can leave that up for a sec.
16               But --
17                     Anyway, this is a report on smokers.
18               They talk about the youth market, the
19               importance of the youth market.  And look at
20               the age of the kids.  Twelve years old, 13
21               years old, 14 years old, 15 years old, 16 years
22               old, 17, 18.  68.7 percent start by 18; over
23               half start before they're 17.  The median age
24               is 16.7 years.  But these are their customers.
25                     The industry cannot exist without

 1               replacing the smokers that are leaving the
 2               market.  The smokers that are leaving the
 3               market are the older ones that are either
 4               quitting or dying.  They're leaving the market.
 5                     Nicholas Cage left Las Vegas in similar
 6               fashion.  If you ever saw that movie, he drank
 7               himself to death and died.
 8                     So I hear "leaving the market," keeping a
 9               business in equilibrium by reestablishing
10               getting youthful children into the market, that
11               just -- that cannot square with any notion of
12               what should be acceptable behavior.
13                     We cannot ever be comfortable selling a
14               product which most of our customers would stop
15               using if they could.  That is to say, if the
16               exit gate from our market should suddenly open,
17               we could be out of business almost overnight.
18               These are exhibits in evidence.
19                     I want the Teague one.  Here.
20                     Now, I talked about sine qua non.  I'll
21               do this quick.  They know that the tobacco
22               product is the vehicle for the delivery of
23               nicotine.  They know this.  This is what the
24               whole business is on.  All smoking is based
25               upon nicotine.

 1                     No matter what you say about marketing,
 2               no matter what you say about packaging, the
 3               Federal Trade Commission, in the '60s and the
 4               '80s, said it's wall to wall, it's saturation
 5               advertising.  There's no way to avoid
 6               advertising.  They use peer pressure to get
 7               people to smoke.
 8                     You're going to hear the defense saying,
 9               we don't know specifically which ad he saw, and
10               his wife began smoking filters and he began
11               smoking filters.
12                     They were smoking filters for safety.  It
13               was the plan in place by tobacco to keep their
14               smoking -- smokers smoking, to give them a
15               psychological crutch, and say let's keep them
16               smoking, what can we do to reassure when they
17               are in their -- deep in their biological
18               depths, some fear, an irrational fear, no
19               matter what pooh-poohing logic we put out
20               there, that the smoker could have a problem
21               with this cigarette, how do we keep them
22               smoking?  And it worked.  The business worked.
23                     What would have happened if, in the '50s
24               or in the '60s, instead of lambasting the
25               Surgeon General's report and calling it

 1               half-baked and in certain years saying the
 2               Surgeon General is trying to intentionally
 3               mislead the public, what would have happened if
 4               they had come forward and said, this is bad, we
 5               know it's bad, we're changing our business,
 6               we're never going to sell it to kids, we're
 7               going to help people that want to get off
 8               cigarettes, if we have an 18-year-old or a
 9               12-year-old that started smoking and now they
10               come to us and they're 25 and they want to quit
11               smoking, we will help them, we will give them
12               cessation products, we will give them
13               denicotinized cigarettes, we'll give them
14               something, we will help them get off
15               cigarettes?
16                     What did they do instead?  They created
17               this situation.  The delivery of attractive
18               dosage forms of nicotine, manipulated with
19               additives and ammonia to make the nicotine
20               freebase, like crack cocaine, the molecular
21               structure, so it hits the brain in seven
22               seconds so hard that it addicts the pediatric
23               brain at a moment of vulnerability.
24                     Fishermen use hooks in bait to catch
25               fish.  That's the whole purpose behind fishing.

 1               The fish don't know the hook is in the bait.
 2               That's the whole reason behind it.
 3                     So making a business, saying we've got --
 4               we've got this drug, it sells great because a
 5               good number of folks -- we don't know which
 6               ones, but if we cast our net wide enough, if we
 7               throw enough lines in the water, we're --
 8               we're-- enough of those triers of cigarette
 9               smoke are going to become permanent, lifelong
10               customers; and when they die, we'll replace
11               them with their children.  Is that --
12                     I mean, are we so --
13                     We haven't become, in this country, so
14               cynical, so enured to everybody does something
15               wrong, that we can't come back into this
16               courtroom, in front of a jury, and say, we
17               reject this and we speak, through the jury, to
18               the tobacco companies, with a roar of moral
19               outrage --
20 Your Honor --
21                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- which rejects --
22 -- you ruled out this type
23               of argument.
24                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
25                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  I get fired up.

 1                     When you guys go back in the courtroom
 2               (sic), you have to coolly, calmly,
 3               dispassionately, weigh the evidence, without
 4               prejudice for any other side, without prejudice
 5               to the tobacco company, but based on the
 6               science and the evidence, without prejudice for
 7               Mrs. Skolnick, because you have sympathy or you
 8               care about her, or prejudice against her
 9               because some of the things that the tobacco
10               company said about her, which we will address.
11                     Let's get to this.  The sine qua non of
12               tobacco products.  The attractive dosages form
13               of nicotine.
14                     They've got to get him to try something,
15               to try something that he doesn't know what's in
16               it.  You got to get a kid to try something;
17               emulate a figure, a sports hero, to look cool
18               in the peer group, you've got to do that.
19                     And it says:  We have deliberately played
20               down the role of nicotine; hence, the
21               non-smoker has little or no knowledge of what
22               satisfactions it may offer him and no reason to
23               try it.  Instead, we must convince him, with
24               wholly irrational reasons, that he should try
25               smoking, in the hope that he will then discover

 1               the real, in quotes, satisfactions obtainable.
 2               That's one of the code words for addiction.
 3                     Now, that is some cold-blooded stuff.
 4               That is --
 5                     When I read it -- and I've read it a --
 6               hundred times -- it is --
 7 Objection, opinion, Your
 8               Honor.
 9                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- I think --
10                     THE COURT:  Sustained, to the extent not
11               your own opinion.
12                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  I submit to you
13               that you could conclude that that is chilling,
14               that is an intent to hook children.
15                     Let's go to the children board, please.
16                     If our company is to survive and prosper
17               over the long term, we must get our share of
18               the youth market.  For the pre-smoker and
19               learner, the physical effects of smoking are
20               largely unknown, unneeded or actually quite
21               unpleasant or awkward the expected or derived
22               physiological effects are largely responsible
23               for influencing the pre-smoker to try smoking
24               and provide sufficient motivation during the
25               learning periods to keep the learner going,

 1               despite the physical unpleasantness and
 2               awkwardness of the period.
 3                     The fragile developing of a young person
 4               needs all of the support and enhancement he can
 5               get.  The self-image enhancement effect has
 6               traditionally been a strong promotional theme
 7               for cigarette brands and should be continued to
 8               be emphasized.
 9                     And it talks about the top five brands.
10               You'll notice these are the brands that
11               Mr. Skolnick smoked.  We know he started
12               somewhere between the ages of ten and 17, back
13               in the '30s.
14                     He was dependent upon the drug in the
15               cigarettes to some degree, to some meaningful
16               way that kept him smoking.  His wife was able
17               to quit.  He couldn't quit.  He tried.
18                     Back at the time, the hippie-dippie stuff
19               they had like, Erhard seminar training, or
20               transcendental meditation --
21                     And this is a guy that was a little old
22               for that generation of stuff.  He gave it a
23               shot.  He tried.  He sucked on plastic
24               cigarettes.  He cut down.  He couldn't stop.
25               But that's not the determination of whether or

 1               not he's a member of the class.
 2                     One of the issues for you to decide is,
 3               is he a member of the class, does he belong in
 4               the class.
 5                     Well, did the lawyers have a problem
 6               finding class members?  I mean, 443,000 people
 7               a year die; right?  A lot of people every year
 8               die.  Florida represents a substantial
 9               percentage of that population.  The period of
10               time that the class members come from is from
11               '92 to '96.
12                     And there are a tremendous number of
13               folks who were the addicted smokers whose
14               addiction drove that smoking behavior to the
15               point where they got illnesses from it.
16                     Nobody smokes a pack, a pack and a half,
17               or two packs of cigarettes a day for 40 or 50
18               years unless they have a dependence.
19                     "Dependence" and "addiction" are the same
20               thing.  A dependence, a need for that drug in
21               the system, which has changed permanently the
22               pediatric brain and drives that dependence
23               process.  That's just the fact of the matter.
24                     The internal documents that came out are
25               a revelation.  They say in the preface, in the

 1               introductory statement, in the Surgeon General
 2               2012 report, our scientists are analyzing these
 3               internal documents to learn now what was really
 4               going on.
 5                     We're coming to understand what tobacco
 6               knew and bragged about.  We are years ahead of
 7               the public health industry, what we know about
 8               the nicotine we sell.  They bragged about that.
 9                     Martin Luther King said --
10 Objection, Your Honor.
11                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- that the --
12                     THE COURT:  Counsel, let's not have
13               comments from other --
14                     Stick to the argument of this case.
15                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can -- I can't give a
16               quote from a famous person?
17                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
18                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  No?
19                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
20                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
21                     So, another thing.  From time to time,
22               when describing market categories and target
23               audiences, we use references such as young
24               smokers, young market, youth market, et cetera.
25                     In the future, when describing the

 1               low-age end of the cigarette business, please
 2               use the term "young adult smoker" or "young
 3               adult smoking market."
 4                     So they have the 12-year-olds and now
 5               you'll see in that page, under "12-year-olds,"
 6               it says "young adult smoking market."  They're
 7               calling 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds,
 8               14-year-olds, young adults.  That's not true.
 9                     What do you tell -- what does --
10                     A parent is obligated to teach their
11               child about the dangers or hazards of smoking.
12               The parents have the obligation to teach the
13               kids.
14                     What does the parent explain to the
15               children about products like this when they ask
16               mommy or daddy, what about this stuff, and
17               mommy and daddy can't say, try it or use it
18               because, you know, it's bad; and we know that
19               the rebelliousness of youth is such that they
20               have a tendency to rebel or go against what
21               parents say.  If the parent says, don't use it,
22               that even puts a risk in the kid of using it --
23               of a child of using it.
24                     So what do you say, when it looks like
25               such a normal product, to keep kids off of the

 1               cigarettes?  Ninety percent of smoking
 2               disappears if nobody under 21 gets cigarettes.
 3               That's just a fact.  Nobody -- kids --
 4                     People over 21, if you take --
 5                     If they want to do the right thing and
 6               they want to have a business in this country,
 7               and they say, we are ready to choose to do the
 8               right thing, we admit this is a highly
 9               dangerous product, it's hurt an awful lot of
10               people, we want to do the right thing, we want
11               to help, we have chosen to make arrangements to
12               keep cigarettes out of the hands of anyone
13               under 21, ever, because that will reduce this
14               epidemic to one-tenth of what it is now, they
15               would still have a business, but the business
16               would truly be a business from at least folks
17               that are closer to being fully brain-developed
18               adults that are out of that vulnerable period
19               of extraordinary susceptibility, and give folks
20               a chance to not end up an addicted smoker for
21               life and succumb to a -- the terrible diseases
22               that end up causing folks to die in an
23               ignominious way, in a way that's painful and
24               great suffering.
25                     The books before you say that --

 1                     You want to talk about healthcare crisis
 2               in this country?  $97 billion a year today, in
 3               today's dollars, in -- the harm caused in our
 4               society from tobacco.
 5                     Now, if you -- if you look at the --
 6                     I want to look at the definition of
 7               "punitive damages," please.
 8                     So --
 9                     Did I already do this?  I did the whole
10               thing?
11                     Okay.  The conduct causing loss to the
12               plaintiff was so gross and flagrant as to show
13               a reckless disregard of human life or of the
14               safety of persons exposed to the effects of
15               such conduct, so that it's the loss to -- the
16               plaintiff is the personal representative of the
17               estate, Mrs. Skolnick.
18                     And the question is, is what tobacco did
19               in the conspiracy -- you know, there's a group
20               effort to hide the health effects and maintain
21               and sustain the business -- so gross and
22               flagrant as to show a reckless disregard for
23               the life or the safety of persons exposed to
24               the effects of such conduct.
25                     It has to do with all of the folks that

 1               were hurt and sickened, the millions that never
 2               got a day in court, the millions of folks that
 3               didn't have the benefit of the -- of what was
 4               forced to be admitted when the States Attorneys
 5               General came out --
 6 Objection, Your Honor.
 7                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
 8 Same objection, Your Honor.
 9               You've already ruled this out.
10                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
11                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  It wasn't until 2000,
12               pursuant to compulsory proceedings, that a lot
13               of these internal documents were shaken loose.
14               And it's current, they're still being analyzed
15               and studied today.
16                     Now, let's go to the Engle findings,
17               please.
18                     Okay.  So Question 1 --
19                     And I keep trying to skip over and go
20               back to it because I think that Question 1 is
21               clear, and I think that you all have seen
22               evidence un-rebutted.
23                     In other words, all of the evidence, all
24               the people, lay people, doctors, treating
25               doctors, independent eyewitnesses --

 1                     Dr. Davis, who came in here, he's an
 2               independent eyewitness like a man standing on a
 3               street corner that sees an accident and the
 4               policeman says, did you see something?  He says
 5               yes.  No axe to grind.
 6                     He has no interest in being a courtroom
 7               doctor; he just likes to treat patients.  He
 8               was involved in the diagnosis and treatment of
 9               Leo's lung cancer.  He said it was clearly from
10               smoking.  Ninety percent of all lung cancers
11               are from smoking.  He was unrebutted.
12                     And as Dr. Burns reflected on, all the
13               other physicians who treated -- Berkowitz,
14               Rosenthal, Cohen -- every treating physician,
15               all of the innocent, independent, believable,
16               unimpeachable witnesses said the man had a
17               smoking-related disease.
18                     He smoked an awful lot of cigarettes a
19               really long time, just like any generic smoker;
20               he succumbed to smoking-related cancer, and it
21               killed him.  There's no doubt about that.
22               There's no opposing testimony to that effect.
23                     There's rumor, innuendo, speculation,
24               supposition and arguments by the defendant to
25               try to picket it, punch some holes in it; but I

 1               think that the evidence has been very --
 2                     I think you'll find the evidence is
 3               manifestly apparent that it's clear, it's
 4               simple, what he died from.
 5                     And here's an example:  When it suits the
 6               purposes of the defense -- when it suits the
 7               purposes of the defense for them to use
 8               something having to do with smoking-related
 9               cancer in what could be a very simple
10               proposition --
11                     Meaning, did Leo Skolnick die from
12               smoking cigarettes?  Yes.  You could say that
13               in two seconds flat.  Dr. Davis could say that.
14               The death certificate says he died of lung
15               cancer.  In two seconds flat, you could say
16               that.  Did he die of smoking cigarettes?  It
17               shouldn't be a hard thing to determine.
18                     We know now, even though conceptually
19               it's hard to wrap your mind around the fact
20               that there's a thousand documents we found that
21               say that ain't nothing but a nicotine syringe,
22               that ain't nothing but drugs, and it makes you
23               addicted, it makes you dependent, you continue
24               to smoke and your free choice is impaired, it's
25               constrained.  We know that.  That should be

 1               simple.
 2                     You get a guy like Dr. Davis, he comes in
 3               in two minutes, bom, boom, bing, no doubt about
 4               it.
 5                     Dr. Kleinman testified from the CAT scans
 6               the man had lung cancer.  He didn't have colon
 7               cancer.  They kept giving him colonoscopies.
 8               The colonoscopies were normal.  Is that fair to
 9               put forth a defense to suggest a man --
10                     Bring in a witness, a gastroenterologist.
11               Dr. Rosenthal --
12 Objection, Your Honor,
13               unfair argument --
14                     THE COURT:  Overruled.  I'm going to
15               allow it.
16                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. Rosenthal is the
17               treating doctor that took care of him for colon
18               cancer.  He was -- the testimony is he was
19               cured of colon cancer.
20                     Two months before he was diagnosed with
21               lung cancer, they did a colonoscopy.  He didn't
22               have a recurrence of colon cancer.  Why would
23               they --
24                     Why suggest that?  If you want to come in
25               the courtroom and say, we have a defense,

 1               here's what it is, put up some evidence of it,
 2               not just take a potshot at our clear
 3               evidence --
 4                     Because folks -- folks like to fill in
 5               the blanks.  Folks want to say, you know what?
 6               We heard a bunch of stuff, but what didn't we
 7               hear?  What blanks do you want to fill in?
 8                     And so I think Question 1, all the folks
 9               said addiction, there wasn't any fuss about
10               that.  Lay people said it, treating doctors
11               with no axe to grind said it.
12                     The world's leading authority, Dr. Burns,
13               synthesized it for you and said, yes, your
14               smoking behavior is as a result of some part of
15               your constrained choice, you can no longer say
16               it's a free choice; and so, therefore, you
17               continue to smoke lots and lots and lots of
18               cigarettes for a really, really long time, and
19               over a period of time the genetic changes occur
20               and eventually you get lung cancer.
21                     So that's -- that's the class membership
22               for the folks from the period of time from '92
23               to '96, is that they were addicted to the
24               nicotine in cigarettes and got a
25               smoking-related disease.  That's a simple

 1               question and answer.
 2                     Dr. Davis remembered he was a heavy
 3               smoker.  It was a vague recollection, but he
 4               remembered it, and we put that evidence before
 5               you.  Now, it was arduous --
 6                     And we don't know how much evidence you
 7               need.  We don't know.  And that's one of the
 8               things that I apologize for.  I'm sorry.
 9                     It's like studying for exams when you're
10               in college, and your head is so full of
11               information, it's leaking out of your ears and
12               your mouth and your nose.
13                     When I wake up in the middle of the
14               night, tossing and turning, I'm writing stuff
15               down.  I can't even -- I can hardly read what I
16               wrote down, but I say, I got something to say,
17               I know it's here, I know it's going to come out
18               of me, I don't know what it is.
19                     I got a head lamp, I click it on, write
20               something down, because I want to tell you
21               something, because I want to convince you, I
22               want to persuade you, I want you to see it our
23               way, without distractions, as to what the true
24               evidence is.
25                     And I'll give you an example.  Sunny.

 1               Sunny.  Was there any debate in this
 2               courtroom -- was there any problem from the
 3               defendants, from these fine lawyers --
 4                     And they're fine lawyers.  They do a good
 5               job, smart guys, for their client.  No -- no
 6               getting around that.
 7                     Was there any debate, though --
 8                     When Mr. Belasic came up and said on
 9               many, many occasions, when it suits his
10               purposes, that, well, Mr. Skolnick --
11                     His own beloved sister died, and she
12               smoked cigarettes.  And the Skolnicks
13               associated the smoking of cigarettes with her
14               death, and shouldn't that have been a piece of
15               information that would have helped him quit?
16               He had the choice to quit, why didn't he quit?
17               He knew this was harmful.  Why didn't he quit?
18                     It's a fair question and we're going to
19               talk about that in the fault phase.  In the
20               fault phase.  But it's got nothing to do with
21               class membership.
22                     Question 1 is only this (indicating); and
23               whether or not Mr. Skolnick could have quit is
24               not in dispute.
25                     We accepted some responsibility when we

 1               get to those percentages of fault.  We didn't
 2               have to.  Mrs. Skolnick wanted to accept, and
 3               said the human weaknesses --
 4                     He -- could he have tried harder?  Fair
 5               game.  Could he have?  We know a lot of people
 6               have quit, but a lot of people haven't quit.
 7                     We know a lot of people try to quit, and
 8               something like only three percent of people in
 9               the given course of a year, out of millions,
10               succeed in quitting, that it takes many, many
11               times to quit.  It's a relapsing brain disease.
12                     And a lot of people don't get around to
13               quitting until it's too late.
14                     And here's a man that's so addicted, that
15               that nice lady -- I forget her name -- came in
16               and said, who smokes after you get addicted --
17               after you get diagnosed with lung cancer and
18               you're sneaking cigarettes, you're taking
19               cigarettes from your friend that are nasty,
20               dirty, half-smoked cigarettes and sticking them
21               in your pocket?  That's addiction.
22                     So that's an easy question.  There's
23               nothing in there that's going to say what the
24               definition of "addiction" is.  This book has
25               got a million and one consensus ways of

 1               determining addiction, talking about smoking in
 2               the morning when you're depleted, smoking a lot
 3               of cigarettes.
 4                     Eighty to 90 percent of regular smokers,
 5               pack-a-day smokers, are dependent upon the
 6               nicotine, and it drives them.
 7                     So if some of his smoking behavior --
 8                     A significant, important part of why he
 9               smoked was because he was dependent on
10               nicotine, and it can be for no other reason.
11                     Their own internal documents say, in
12               absolute terms, we are in the nicotine-delivery
13               business.  That's it.
14                     But there was no problem whatsoever --
15                     THE CLERK:  You've used 45 minutes.
16                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.
17                     There was no problem whatsoever when they
18               talked about Sunny.  Nobody said that we debate
19               whether Sunny's smoking was the cause of her
20               lung cancer.  Why wasn't that a debate?
21                     Because tobacco companies, in the year
22               2000, finally, under duress, had to admit
23               smoking causes lung cancer.
24 Objection, Your Honor.
25                     THE COURT:  Sustained.

 1                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  In the year 2000, and
 2               never before -- never before --
 3                     You saw those -- the CEOs raise their
 4               hands, and all gather before Congress, the
 5               CEOs, the major executives of gigantic, huge
 6               companies, raise their hands and lied right to
 7               your face, in 1994, tobacco is not addictive,
 8               okay?
 9                     There was no problem, though, inferring
10               that the smoking that Sunny did was the cause
11               of her lung cancer when it suited their
12               purposes, so they would argue, well, that
13               should have motivated Leo to quit.  Okay?
14                     If she was in here trying to establish
15               that claim, do you think we would see it?
16 Objection, Your Honor.
17                     THE COURT:  Overruled.  This is argument.
18               I'm going to allow it.
19                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  If she was in here, do
20               you think they would accept that so easily?
21               No.
22                     Because tobacco has admitted that -- now,
23               that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, just
24               not in people who sue us.  Tobacco has admitted
25               that cigarette smoking is addictive, just not

 1               in people who sue us.
 2 Objection, Your Honor.
 3                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
 4 It's litigation.
 5                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
 6                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  How many times has
 7               Dr. Burns had to come into court to testify
 8               about these simple, obvious facts?
 9 Objection.  May we
10               approach, Your Honor?
11                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Will you hold my time?
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
 7                     THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you
 8               should disregard counsel's last statements, and
 9               it should play no part in your deliberations in
10               this case.
11                     You may proceed.
12                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Please the Court.
13                     I want to talk to you about the --
14                     I was still on the reprehensibility?
15                     The reason why we showed you as many of
16               the internal tobacco documents, which the
17               Surgeon General '12, to this day, show how
18               current they are, is saying it's still being
19               analyzed by scientists, still subject to
20               scientific analysis, is because this is
21               current.
22                     So, if the -- if the concept of class
23               membership --
24                     If Mr. Skolnick is a class member, as we
25               hope the evidence shows, because he needs to

 1               have had a dependence to nicotine that drove,
 2               to some extent, to a meaningful, significant
 3               extent, smoking for a long enough period of
 4               time to get a smoking-related illness, he's a
 5               class member.
 6                     So, then, when a class membership is
 7               determined -- and that should be a threshold
 8               question, it's a preliminary question, and,
 9               most importantly, it does not address the
10               concept of fault.
11                     Do not let the distinction get blurred in
12               your mind, that if Mr. Skolnick could have
13               tried harder to quit -- which we will concede
14               as a matter of his human weakness, he could
15               have tried harder -- that goes to a
16               determination of the degree to which you
17               believe he was partially responsible for what
18               happened to him because he did not work harder
19               to quit.
20                     That's fault --
21 Objection, Your Honor, it
22               misstates the law, particularly Douglas.
23                     THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, this is
24               argument.  Let me, again, remind you that what
25               the lawyers say during their argument or, for

 1               that matter, at any time, is not what the law
 2               is.  The law that you have is, what I have
 3               given you, that's what you follow.
 4                     This is argument of counsel, and the
 5               lawyers do not talk about the -- are not
 6               evidence of the facts of the case.  You recall
 7               what the facts are.  This is argument of
 8               counsel.  And the same applies to the
 9               defendants.
10                     You may proceed, sir.
11                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, we're
12               many years down the road from the Engle case.
13               These are Engle progeny cases.
14                     This is a request to you that he is a
15               member of the Engle progeny class.  Threshold
16               determination, has nothing to do with
17               compensation for her loss of her husband, the
18               years that she didn't get with her husband.
19               Think about that when you determine how to
20               parse relative degrees of responsibility.
21                     When I talked about a reprehensibility of
22               conduct, the important point I'm trying to make
23               with you is we are here for a day of reckoning,
24               punishment for past deeds.
25                     It is the last question on the verdict

 1               form:  Do you find, by clear and convincing
 2               evidence, that punitive damages are warranted?
 3                     And we ask you to -- if you see it our
 4               way, to indulge us with that finding, so that
 5               you may find the tobacco company, for what they
 6               did for over 50 years in engaging in an
 7               enterprise which traded disease and death,
 8               knowledgeably, with intent, on purpose, with
 9               full understanding, for profits, for corporate
10               profits, that it was wrongdoing that does not
11               square with what we consider to be reasonable
12               in our society, and we are not so cynical and
13               our society has not degraded to that point, our
14               society is progressing, we are learning to live
15               together and respect each other, and we're
16               moving forward from past mistakes, and it is
17               the past mistakes and the airing out of them,
18               and the recognition of them and the rejection
19               of them by jurors like you that send a
20               deterrence to others, and a recognition, a
21               rejection of the conduct, saying we -- we used
22               to trust our businesses --
23                     Leave It To Beaver, the Skolnicks, 1918,
24               1930, World War I, World War II, people trusted
25               their government implicitly, they trusted their

 1               corporations implicitly.  Now --
 2 Objection, beyond the scope
 3               of the evidence.
 4                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
 5                     You can go ahead.
 6                     Go ahead.
 7                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  So these are how we
 8               would like you to answer these questions -- the
 9               very last question.
10                     You'll have to go a little bit further.
11               You'll have to come and listen to a little more
12               evidence and try to get it done; but that's --
13               that's why -- that's really why we're here.
14                     And Mr. Skolnick is a conduit to that
15               because he's one of the victims.  He's one of
16               many.  And the evidence you saw of all the
17               wrongdoing supports the idea that he's one of
18               many.
19                     And the conduct you can consider not just
20               to him, but to everybody similarly situated,
21               the millions of Americans who are sick and
22               dying by being misled about cigarettes.
23                     Now, there was lots of information out
24               there.  There was songs like "Smoke, Smoke,
25               Smoke," but the guy in "Smoke, Smoke, Smoke"

 1               says, I've been smoking them all my life, and
 2               they haven't bothered me yet.
 3                     And it was a catchy tune with a jingle,
 4               and cigarettes sales kept going, and profits
 5               kept going, and they spent a quarter trillion
 6               dollars in advertising.
 7                     And Emerson Foote says in this book, in
 8               the 2012 book, that it never ceases to amaze
 9               him that only does the tobacco industry suggest
10               that their sales don't -- that their sales are
11               not driven by advertising.  It's only in that
12               world.
13                     The fact is, the 2012 book on youth
14               smoking has come to the definitive conclusion
15               that advertising, peer pressure and the like,
16               cause kids to smoke.
17                     Can we put up 79, please?
18                     Now, just an example.  I can't do all --
19               I can't do it all.  You've got the evidence,
20               you can read it.  I can't do it all.  I don't
21               have the time.  Here's an example of just an
22               out-and-out falsehood, lie, deception.
23                     Didn't you see the statement of regret
24               from -- from Dr. Burns, that all those years
25               they faked him out, how many people died

 1               because they didn't know about the filters?
 2               Didn't you see that?
 3                     Here's what it says, in 1961, in the
 4               internal documents.  And this isn't from a
 5               couple of stupid people; this is from the chief
 6               scientists, the chief corporate officers.  Huge
 7               amounts of -- amalgams of attorneys and
 8               scientists, scientists that were either duped
 9               and unwitting, like Dr. Burns, whose intentions
10               were good, but were misled by the fake filter
11               fraud, the filter that causes worse cancer,
12               filter cancer, deeper adenocarcinomas in your
13               lungs, because the filters don't work, but it
14               will make people think something bad is coming
15               out of it.
16                     And some guy invents a color-changing
17               filter that's got a food color dye in it, so
18               when you suck on it, it turns brown; and even
19               though it doesn't do anything for the filter,
20               people attach significance to it.
21 Objection, Your Honor,
22               contrary to the evidence.
23                     THE COURT:  Overruled.
24                     Ladies and gentlemen, again, you're the
25               judges of what the evidence has or has not been

 1               in the case.
 2                     This is argument, counsel.
 3                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's a document in
 4               evidence you will see, disclosure of invention,
 5               signed off by a bunch of people.  People attach
 6               a great amount of significance to the brown --
 7               that snowy-white filter turning brown at the
 8               end; and if we could put a color-changing dye
 9               in there that would change color, preferably
10               brown, folks will think the benefits are
11               obvious, even though it probably won't do
12               anything to help filter anything out.  Nothing
13               was being taken out of those filters.
14                     So here's one.  Here's what they knew.
15               This is an internal document.  Carcinogens are
16               found in practically every class of compounds
17               in smoke.  Present technology does not permit
18               selective filtration of particulate of smoke.
19               Meaning, we know --
20                     And that was that page with all those
21               cancer-causing chemicals.  This is what their
22               internal scientists knew.  That was in 1961.
23                     Then, when the Surgeon General report was
24               being put together and they were giving
25               information to the Surgeon General, here's what

 1               they told the Surgeon General:  We are prepared
 2               to submit the chemical and constituents of
 3               smoke.  None of the chemicals listed -- none of
 4               the chemical substances listed therein, to our
 5               knowledge, has been found by scientific
 6               research to be harmful to the health of the
 7               smoker in the amounts reported in smoke.  It is
 8               possible, of course, to modify the chemical
 9               composition of cigarette smoke by the use of
10               filters.
11                     Cancer, no cancer.  It cannot be removed
12               by filtration, it is impossible.  It is
13               possible to remove it by filtration.
14                     These things are not acceptable.  What we
15               try to get you to do in this courtroom is see
16               things as they are, break through the immersed
17               desaturation effect of advertising, decades of
18               the normalizing of tobacco, to say, hey, you
19               know what?  Everybody had some idea about
20               tobacco, we know it's bad; but nobody, unless
21               they've read these internal documents, knows
22               just how bad it is.  That's what's so important
23               to -- to think about.
24                     The other thing about coming to a
25               decision that there should be punishment is

 1               that this is a civil side of a courtroom.  It's
 2               not a criminal side of a courtroom.  It's not a
 3               State Attorney/prosecutor talking about jail
 4               time and sentencing.  This is in the civil
 5               realm.
 6                     The civil realm provides for the redress
 7               of wrongs with fines and punishments.  So you
 8               sit in judgment and you are permitted to make a
 9               determination that there should be punishment.
10                     And one of the questions you have to
11               answer to get to that point is, you have to
12               decide was there reliance, was there inferred
13               contemplated reliance.
14                     As the Judge instructed you, it doesn't
15               have to be anything specific; it can be that
16               wallpaper, that endless onslaught, that
17               campaign of controversy and doubt --
18                     Can we put that up, the Controversy and
19               Doubt, Doubt Is Our Product?
20                     -- that keeps smokers smoking or gives
21               them a doubt or gives them a psychological
22               crutch to continue smoking, and using the
23               illusion of filtration to keep it going so
24               folks think, hey, something bad's being taken
25               out.

 1                     Now, there's going to be a couple of
 2               questions that pertain to both RJR and Philip
 3               Morris, the two largest tobacco manufacturers.
 4               They conspired with the groups that they
 5               bought, owned and maintained:  The Center for
 6               Tobacco Research, the Tobacco Institute
 7               Research Council, the Tobacco Institute.  Those
 8               were the guys -- they put out that Frank
 9               Statement, saying, we accept as a paramount
10               responsibility among all -- above all other
11               responsibilities, the duty to safeguard the
12               public health, even above our own business.
13                     And they said a bunch of times, if we
14               ever find anything bad, if we're doing
15               something bad, we're going to take it out.
16                     Well, that's promises and lies.  They
17               made promises, but they told lies.  And so they
18               said doubt is our product.  It is also the
19               means of establishing a controversy.
20                     Go up to the top.
21                     The committee has been formed, it's been
22               a successful defensive operation.
23                     Next.
24                     We have to offer the smokers a
25               psychological crutch and self-rationale to keep

 1               smoking.
 2                     And then, obviously, the key word is
 3               "confusion."  Anything we can do to confirm
 4               such a situation works to our advantage.
 5                     This is a smattering.  There are millions
 6               and millions and millions of pages.  We can
 7               only show a few.
 8                     Down here.
 9                     And this is --
10                     What we're saying in the cigarette
11               controversy, the doubt campaign that they
12               created, is that it's going to be --
13                     It could be subject to the charge and may
14               be subject to the finding that we're making
15               false or misleading statements to promote the
16               sale of cigarettes.
17                     It's an admission that what we're doing
18               is illegal.
19                     And these are the documents we have.
20                     The most important story is the one
21               that --
22 Objection, Your Honor.
23                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- casts doubt --
24                     THE COURT:  Overruled.
25                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  And down here --

 1                     I already did that.  Down here, please.
 2                     The CTR and the industry have publicly
 3               and frequently denied what others find as
 4               truth, in quotation marks.  Like what Stephen
 5               Colbert says on his show, "truthiness."
 6                     Right here:  Let's face it, we are
 7               interested in evidence which we believe denies
 8               the allegation that cigarette smoking causes
 9               disease.
10                     And they kept that going in the '50s,
11               when they had the health cancer scare, and then
12               the smoking shot back up in the '60s, the '70s,
13               the '80s, and the '90s.  They never admitted
14               it, and so the reliance continued by Leo
15               Skolnick, who there is no evidence that he
16               rejected what they said.
17                     The only evidence is from his wife that
18               he heard, in those Congressional hearings and
19               what have you, that the companies were looking
20               into it and waiting to see what was going to
21               happen, and companies wouldn't do that to folks
22               and we're going to see what happens.
23                     His behavior to continue smoking, his
24               behavior of going to "light" cigarettes, is
25               evidence of his reliance on what they had to

 1               say.  And --
 2                     THE CLERK:  You used an hour, sir.
 3                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.
 4                     And the findings that are so -- that --
 5                     It's as if you found them yourself.
 6                     I think of those findings as --
 7                     I think about the statue at Iwo Jima,
 8               where they took Iwo Jima and those guys were
 9               holding the flag up, because we can't ever
10               underestimate or overemphasize the importance
11               of the conclusions that were such -- such
12               important things to create.  It's like --
13                     It's like an oak tree is growing, an oak
14               tree of truth, planted with the roots of those
15               findings that I'm asking you guys to water
16               today and keep it alive.
17                     And if they take it and they shake it,
18               they can knock a leaf off now and then.  That
19               can happen.  But the truth that the evidence
20               showed us in this case is that a powerful
21               industry, dependent upon the perpetuation of a
22               tobacco epidemic, with no regard for the kind
23               of harm it caused, traded it for profits, and
24               it should -- no matter where we get to, that
25               must not be considered acceptable.

 1                     Let's look at Slide 68.
 2                     Who has the willpower?
 3                     Okay.  Let's look at the -- Slide 70,
 4               2004 SGR on addiction.
 5                     Give you an example:  Does nicotine
 6               addiction cause disease?
 7                     2004, nicotine addition.  The scheme
 8               linking nicotine addiction and lung cancer via
 9               tobacco smoke carcinogens are their induction
10               of multiple mutations in critical genes.
11                     So, nicotine addiction leads to cigarette
12               smoking, various biochemical changes, some of
13               which were explained by Dr. Burns, all the way
14               through to changing in the miscoding of the
15               DNA, mutations, and then lung cancer.  But you
16               see, this is the Surgeon General:  Nicotine
17               addiction causes disease.
18                     Choice to quit is fault, is a percentage
19               of fault.  We'll go to that next.
20                     Let me show concurring.  Let me show
21               concurring cause, the original concurring cause
22               language, please.  Slide 7 or 1.
23                     No, not that one.
24                     Do you have it?
25                     Okay.  I saw eyes rolling in your heads.

 1               And this is a standard instruction in many,
 2               many different cases, it's a standard civil
 3               instruction.  It's the idea that more than one
 4               thing may cause -- may cause a problem, or that
 5               an illness can be caused by more than one
 6               thing, or --
 7                     It isn't all or none.  It's not black and
 8               white.  It's not always one or the other.  The
 9               Judge gives you the law.
10                     You see, you have a certain power.
11                     I'm putting up this board.  Now, I'm
12               going to talk about something different, but
13               we'll leave the board up.
14                     All the power shifts to you.  Every
15               single thing we do, we turn over to you, and
16               then we sit and we bide our time.  And it's
17               your case, and you have the power.
18                     Each one of you has the complete power
19               and authority to talk, to deliberate, to look
20               at the evidence, to consider it, to decide the
21               believability of the witnesses, the frankness
22               or lack of frankness of the witnesses, and you
23               have a special power.
24                     One of the special powers you have is
25               that folks that call themselves experts, that

 1               come in to give opinions, as opposed to
 2               personal observations, like an unbiased
 3               witness, like a Dr. Davis, who said he was an
 4               addicted smoker that got lung cancer, that
 5               should be the end of story.
 6                     They didn't put on any witnesses to say
 7               he didn't have lung cancer from smoking.  They
 8               didn't put on any witnesses to say that he
 9               wasn't addicted.  They could have put those
10               witnesses on.  They provided no evidence.  They
11               took potshots at ours.
12                     But in the believability of expert
13               witnesses instructions, I want to tell you
14               something that gives you great power, because
15               we hand over great power to you today.
16                     Today, you have more power as citizen
17               government, as jurors, than you might ever have
18               in your entire life.  This is a day of
19               incredible power.  We turn it over to you, and
20               it is yours, okay?
21                     Here's one of the powerful tools I want
22               to give you.  I want to give you the powerful
23               tool of the instruction regarding expert
24               witnesses, because expert witnesses are
25               different than regular people.

 1                     An expert witness that comes in here to
 2               give an opinion is supposed to give an opinion
 3               because he has qualifications, because he has a
 4               scholarly life contribution to offer, with
 5               teaching, and a life well lived, dedicated to a
 6               meaningful, great purpose.  That's a great
 7               expert.  That's how you judge how much does
 8               this guy know.
 9                     If you hear someone who calls themselves
10               an expert and their opinion does not square
11               with what you think is what a true
12               scholastically valid expert should be, you are
13               authorized, specifically in the language for
14               experts, to reject that opinion.  You can roll
15               that opinion right out of the courtroom.
16                     And that's what I suggest you do with
17               Dr. McGregor, because when she came in here,
18               her opinions were unqualified and preposterous.
19               She didn't even know the half-life of uranium.
20               Uranium --
21                     And the half-life of uranium, a
22               radioactive substance, the half-life of it is
23               dependent upon its --
24                     The dangerousness of it is dependent upon
25               its half-life.  If you don't know the

 1               half-life, you don't know how radioactive it
 2               is.
 3                     And that whole business was a
 4               distraction.  The whole -- the whole piece of
 5               paper that they brought from the one case from
 6               Mrs. Skolnick doesn't go to her being a
 7               double-dipper or getting paid more than once.
 8               The Judge didn't --
 9                     His Honor would never let us do anything
10               for improper purpose.
11 Objection, Your Honor.
12                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  It was supposed to come
13               in --
14                     THE COURT:  Sustained, counsel.  Don't
15               comment about the Court.
16                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  The law says -- and
17               there's an instruction they read -- that this
18               came in for the purpose of determining whether
19               or not the cause of this gentleman's cancer had
20               something to do with an exposure to radiation,
21               okay?  There's no evidence of it.  There is
22               just no evidence of it.
23                     And the witness that they put on to say
24               there was evidence of it, that talked about
25               thousands and thousands of pages, came up with

 1               very little evidence to prove it.
 2                     And I submit that her testimony doesn't
 3               come anywhere near the real experts, the world
 4               experts, who came in here to talk to you about
 5               what really caused this gentleman's cancer, and
 6               that -- that the -- that even not recognizing,
 7               from 115,000 to $180,000, how much she was
 8               making -- and that's a lot, a lot, a lot of
 9               money for what she did and what she had to
10               say -- she did not have the qualifications or
11               the proof to do anything --
12                     And she didn't say that anything from the
13               plant -- any of the pollution from the plant
14               caused the cancer; but she did say that, of the
15               causes, lung cancer was a cause of his cancer.
16                     Concurring cause instruction, please.
17                     Okay, here.  Let me just do this for you.
18               Ready?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
19               blah.
20                     Okay, take that down.  Go to the next
21               one, okay?  That's because it's -- it's like
22               it's such an important instruction, and we have
23               committees and Supreme Court committees, we try
24               to work out the language, and it bends
25               everybody's mind.  Here is an easier way of

 1               looking at it, okay?
 2                     And I'm not doing this to insult your
 3               intelligence; I'm doing it because I can't
 4               understand the darn instruction.
 5                     In order to be regarded as a legal cause
 6               of lung cancer and death, cigarette smoking
 7               need not be the only cause.  Cigarette smoking
 8               may be a legal cause of lung cancer even though
 9               it operates in combination with radiation.
10                     "Radiation," what a great word.
11               What's -- what could be worse than cigarettes?
12               A nuclear bomb.  Plutonium, that could be
13               worse.  Ooh, it's like a Jolly Rancher, a sour
14               apple Jolly Rancher, Mmm, it tastes so good.  I
15               can say there was radiation, that's worse than
16               cigarettes.  It's a distraction.  There was no
17               radiation.
18                     And if there was -- if there was,
19               sometime in 1959, 1966, if there was, in order
20               to be regarded as a legal cause of lung cancer
21               and death, the cigarettes need not be the only
22               cause.  Cigarettes may be a legal cause of lung
23               cancer even though it operates in combination
24               with radiation, if such radiation occurs at the
25               same time as the cigarettes and the cigarettes

 1               contribute substantially to producing the lung
 2               cancer and the death.
 3                     Show her testimony to that effect.
 4                     And she testified and conceded to the
 5               point we promised we would get you to have her
 6               concede, in our opening statement, which was if
 7               there are multiple causes, one of those
 8               significant causes of death was smoking, and
 9               she did not say that one of the significant
10               causes of death was radiation.
11                     It's a dupe and a dodge, and it's a --
12               it's a distraction.
13                     Show my -- the multiple risk factors.
14                     This is Dr. McGregor:  To the extent that
15               that is true in this case, we're talking about
16               multiple significant contributing causes of
17               Mr. Skolnick's lung cancer.  You'll agree that
18               smoking cigarettes was one of those causes,
19               true?
20                     Answer:  That's true.
21                     Okay.  So, let's go to my cigarette pack.
22               There's radiation, there's a smokestack.
23                     Cigarettes -- the smoke in the cigarettes
24               contained Polonium-210.  Polonium-210.  That is
25               an ionizing radiation with a very short

 1               half-life, and over the course of 50 years of
 2               smoking, it's a known, proven, contributing
 3               cause of lung cancer.  The distraction is
 4               alternative cause.
 5                     I want to show the verified settlement
 6               affidavit from Mrs. Skolnick.
 7                     I'd say we had a toxic exposure in this
 8               courtroom from Dr. McGregor.  She exposed --
 9 Objection, Your Honor.
10                     THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.
11                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Pardon me?
12                     THE COURT:  Just argue the facts in
13               evidence.
14                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yeah.  I think, in this
15               courtroom, what we heard about was another
16               substance.  I'll call it "Bolonium-180,"
17               because that's what I think Dr. McGregor was
18               talking about.  And I think she was talking
19               about it not for the honest purposes of men of
20               great concern for public health, but for the
21               corrupt purposes of an expert paid way more --
22 Objection, move to strike
23               counsel's opinion.
24                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- than she should have
25               been paid.

 1 He just said "I think."
 2                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
 3                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  I think -- I'm sorry.
 4                     I hope you can draw from the evidence
 5               that conclusion.
 6                     So, again, this is with regard --
 7                     This evidence is received by you for
 8               causation.  I have to rebut this defense --
 9               I'll discuss it again -- but it's for
10               causation.  It is to show you that everything
11               Mrs. Skolnick wrote on here was true.
12                     Mrs. Skolnick said she filled this form
13               out.  And we like to highlight and emphasize
14               important parts, but when Mrs. Skolnick had the
15               piece of paper from -- hearing a decade after
16               her -- her -- from hearing --
17                     After a decade after her husband was
18               dead, right, in the 2000-plus years, and
19               decades and decades --
20                     '66, '67, they closed the plant.  He
21               smoked cigarettes the whole time.  He was in
22               the plant where there was supposedly
23               something -- something coming out, and we'll
24               talk about that on rebuttal a little bit.  At
25               some point, she was involved in a case.

 1                     Remember, this is one piece of paper from
 2               the case, offered so that you know
 3               Mrs. Skolnick wrote something, and it's going
 4               to be used for causation, not to prejudice.
 5               There's --
 6                     The law says don't -- don't let prejudice
 7               infect your verdict.  Don't let a misuse of it
 8               suggest something that it's not for.  It's for,
 9               is there causation.
10                     So, Mrs. Skolnick is not an expert
11               witness.  If Mrs. Skolnick had filled this out
12               in this case and said cigarette smoking caused
13               lung cancer, you wouldn't be allowed to see it
14               because expert witnesses testify about
15               causation of disease, unlike addiction, which
16               folks can recognize, because it's a dependence
17               upon a chemical.  Proof of the cause of an
18               illness comes from an expert doctor, a medical
19               trained physician that learns about it.
20                     So here's what the page looked like.  And
21               Mrs. Skolnick wrote her name in.
22                     Next page.  Next page, please.
23                     Okay.  Background information, her name,
24               his date of birth, 1918.  It's going to be a
25               hundred years ago.

 1                     And remember, when you talk --
 2                     Well, I'm going to let Mr. Hammer deal
 3               with the damages as soon as I stop and give him
 4               time to do it.  And I will, okay?
 5                     Next page.
 6                     THE CLERK:  You used an hour and 15
 7               minutes.
 8                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, that's why I'm
 9               wrapping.
10                     Okay.  Where they lived --
11                     1959 is when she said she moved to
12               Maxwell Drive in Westbury.
13                     Next page.  Background information.
14                     Next page.
15                     Okay.  They emphasize the top of this
16               generic form, one page out of a giant lawsuit
17               that you don't know anything about except for
18               this, is whether or not this matters for
19               causation.  Okay?
20                     The illnesses or injuries you are
21               claiming that caused the decedent's death, the
22               date of diagnosis and the decedent's age at
23               that time.  For example, John Doe, decedent,
24               was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1994, at age
25               52; right?

 1                     And what does she write down?
 2               Injury/illness, lung cancer; date of diagnosis,
 3               October '92; age of diagnosis, 74.
 4                     Let me just look at it from the
 5               perspective you guys are looking at it.
 6                     Is there a word on there that is not
 7               true?  It is truth.
 8                     Is there a way in which an attorney can
 9               interpret it to mean that she meant something
10               that she didn't mean or going to get into a
11               state of mind?  You'll take that in mind.
12                     Can she testify as to what -- whether
13               uranium or whether cigarette smoking caused
14               lung cancer?  Is she qualified to do that?  No.
15                     And has everybody testified that
16               cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?  Yes.
17               And even if there was some uranium --
18                     And there was no plutonium at that plant,
19               there was no enriched uranium in that plant,
20               even if there was some -- some particle --
21                     There was that movie with Dustin Hoffman,
22               with the germ, and he went (indicating), and it
23               got in his mouth.  It was like a cartoon.
24                     Even if that happened and it was a
25               contributing cause, the law permits you to

 1               recognize that as long as that smoking, that --
 2                     That pictogram I showed you was an
 3               important cause of it.  He takes -- he takes
 4               the next step.  He gets you guys to answer the
 5               question and we move on.
 6                     Next page, please.
 7                     Okay.  For the claimed illness and
 8               injury, the symptoms the decedent experienced
 9               before being diagnosed.  It was lung cancer;
10               hoarse -- hoarseness and coughing, 1991.
11                     It's true.  She wrote down what they
12               asked her to write down.  She filled out the
13               form.
14                     Next page.
15                     How it was diagnosed.  Lung cancer,
16               x-ray.  Truth.
17                     Next page.
18                     Find a lie in here.  This page, I submit,
19               is being used as a distraction.  And if you
20               follow the law that says I won't let anything
21               cause me to be prejudiced against this woman,
22               then you will not be distracted, you will stick
23               on the fact of what tobacco has done to all
24               these folks for all these years, and you'll get
25               us to the point where we can show you and

 1               discuss with you punishment for reprehensible
 2               behavior of an immoral business plan.
 3                     Next.
 4                     Next page, it talks about treatment.
 5               That's true.
 6                     Barry Davis, he testified --
 7                     And here, additional information about
 8               the -- for the special master about the
 9               specifics of the claim.
10                     This is a worksheet.  I mean, this is a
11               work in progress, and you saw nothing else --
12 Objection, Your Honor, no
13               evidence.
14                     THE COURT:  It's argument.  Overruled.
15                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  And, of course, you
16               won't see, on the verdict form, a reference to
17               Verizon, Sylvania, as to whether or not they
18               have a percentage of negligence in this case.
19               You won't see that question when we talk about
20               the percentages.
21                     Real quickly, look here.  Here's
22               something you haven't seen.  This document will
23               be in evidence.  Read it, consider it.
24                     We didn't bring this up in opening
25               statement because I don't want to be in the

 1               defendant's defense.  But now that it's here,
 2               let's talk about it.  The diagnosis was
 3               ultimately confirmed at his death.
 4                     Please provide any information you have
 5               that confirms the diagnosis of the
 6               injury/illness, as well as any other
 7               information about the claim that you would like
 8               the special master to consider.
 9                     His diagnosis was ultimately confirmed at
10               his death.  The death certificate, which was
11               previously provided, states that lung cancer
12               was Leo's cause of death.  All true.
13                     And how about this?  Leo also was
14               diagnosed with colon cancer in 1979
15               approximately, while we were still living in
16               Westbury.  He had surgery which stabilized his
17               illness.  That's truth.
18                     And if you want to be complete and candid
19               and give her the benefit of the doubt --
20                     And the standards of proof give us the
21               benefit of the doubt; and if you go back there
22               and you have some doubt --
23                     Remember, doubt, controversy, other
24               factors, that's what their documents say.
25               Doubt, controversy, other factors, unproven.

 1                     That's a truthful statement.  He had lung
 2               cancer, he had colon cancer.  He lived through
 3               the colon cancer, he died from the lung cancer.
 4               She answered the questions truthfully.  If you
 5               think she can determine cause --
 6                     Where in there does it say uranium
 7               exposure caused it?
 8                     Where in there is there an expert report,
 9               a doctor, somebody that came in and said that
10               it caused it?  There isn't.  There never will
11               be.  The only person they brought in was
12               Dr. McGregor.
13                     With regard to the percentages of fault
14               for Philip Morris and RJR --
15                     I'm leaving time for Mr. Hammer, and I
16               would like to -- I think I'm going to give him
17               the floor for the next 25 minutes.
18                     Okay.  Put it up.  Put it up and I'll do
19               it.
20                     So, Question 3 and Question 4 are what
21               get you to punitive damages.  You've got to
22               jump over these hurdles, you've got to answer
23               these "yes."
24                     If you see it our way and you want to get
25               to be able to reject this kind of conduct by an

 1               American business over a 50-year period of
 2               time, over a conspiracy, as laid out by those
 3               Engle findings and things like that, here's
 4               what you need to do.
 5                     You will determine that he did, in fact,
 6               justifiably rely to his detriment on an
 7               intentional statement of material fact made by
 8               each defendant after May 5th, 1982, that
 9               intentionally omitted material information
10               concerning the health effects or addictive
11               nature of smoking cigarettes.  And was such
12               reliance a legal cause of Mr. Skolnick's lung
13               cancer and death?  And the answer to both of
14               those questions is "yes."
15                     Dr. Burns explained it.  You quit
16               smoking, you get healthier.
17                     Would he have died on the day that he
18               died if he stopped smoking afterwards?  The
19               answer is no.
20                     Continued smoking accelerates the disease
21               process.  Continued smoking makes it happen
22               sooner.  There is a much stronger certainty he
23               never would have gotten lung cancer if he had
24               stopped smoking by 1978.
25                     But if they had come clean, if they had

 1               said, you know what, what we did was wrong,
 2               we're going to let you know, we're going to
 3               hand you the truth of what we know internally
 4               now, and we're going to say we're not going to
 5               sell it the way we sold it, we're going to help
 6               people get off cigarettes, we're not going to
 7               oppose the introduction of --
 8 Objection, Your Honor.
 9                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- Nicorette gum --
10                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
11 It's not evidence or a
12               claim in the case.
13                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
14                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  They opposed the
15               introduction of Nicorette gum by Merrell Dow.
16               We'll show you --
17                     MR. LOMBARDI:  Objection, Your Honor.
18                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- those documents.
19                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
20                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  They're in evidence.
21                     THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.
22 Okay.  That's the second
23               time, Judge.
24                     MR. SCHLESINGER:  In evidence we have
25               documents from Merrell Dow.

 1                     Put up the Merrell Dow documents.
 2                     In '84, '85, where there was an
 3               opposition to the introduction of Merrell Dow,
 4               okay?
 5                     If you look here, '82, '82, '85, when
 6               Merrell Dow came up with Nicorette gum, which
 7               is the chewing gum, and one of the first things
 8               as a nicotine replacement product in the early
 9               days, the tobacco industry reacted with harsh
10               rejection of it and they threatened, they
11               lodged protests, and then they stopped buying
12               chemicals from Merrell Dow.
13                     They were buying millions of dollars
14               worth of chemicals, and they thought about it,
15               with Merrell Dow, and they said -- and you'll
16               see the letters in here -- that it interferes
17               with their business.
18                     Anything that Merrell Dow would do to
19               give smokers a way to get off cigarettes
20               offended the cigarette companies, they
21               boycotted the chemicals that they bought to use
22               in their cigarettes -- like the ammonia they
23               used -- and they were lodging protests, making
24               Merrell Dow stop putting out the anti-cigarette
25               smoking newsletters, and pushing to stop a way

 1               of helping people get off cigarettes.
 2                     And this wasn't the first time.  In the
 3               '70s, Leo Abood came up with a scientific study
 4               to look for a chemical antagonist to nicotine,
 5               a way to get people off of nicotine; and they
 6               said, it is my strong feeling that the progress
 7               that has been claimed, we are in the process of
 8               digging our own grave, and they rejected
 9               Dr. Abood's attempt to come up with antagonists
10               to nicotine that would help people quit.  And
11               they referred to themselves as people digging
12               our own grave.  Well, whose graves were being
13               dug, if not their own?
14                     If they were opposing efforts to let
15               people stop smoking, they were promoting and
16               pushing them to continue to smoke, after the
17               '80s, which brings us back to that question of
18               reliance that we -- that we ask you to answer
19               "yes," after '82, all the way through '94, even
20               after the fellow was dead, after poor
21               Mr. Skolnick was dead, and the seven CEOs were
22               still saying it -- Mr. Horrigan was saying it;
23               on Nightline they were saying it to Ted Koppel,
24               they were saying it; and Anne Browder was
25               saying, we didn't pay for those product

 1               placements for Superman, and they were doing
 2               all of this.
 3                     And so the next question would be the
 4               same, was it justifiable --
 5                     Did Leo Skolnick justifiably rely to his
 6               detriment on any statement of material fact
 7               made by defendants after 1982, in furtherance
 8               of the agreement to intentionally omit
 9               information concerning the health effects and
10               addictive nature of cigarette smoking; and, if
11               so, was the reliance a legal cause of his lung
12               cancer and death?
13                     And, of course, it was, and you can infer
14               it from the overwhelming amount of energy and
15               effort they put into all of their prevention of
16               cessation and their promotion of smoking and
17               their reassurance of smokers.
18                     Folks, thanks.  I'll have another chance
19               to address you, and then the defendants will,
20               too, and the case will be over.
21                     I'll let Mr. Hammer offer some thoughts.
22                     Thank you.
                
                
                MR. HAMMER:  Thank you.
25                     Mr. Schlesinger talked to you about

 1               conduct of the tobacco companies, talked to you
 2               about the evidence in the case that you heard,
 3               talked to you about Dr. McGregor and why you
 4               should disbelieve her.
 5                     I'm not going to cover all that stuff.
 6               What I want to talk about is Beatrice Skolnick.
 7                     They got married; they fell in love.  And
 8               when they did that, she expected to live the
 9               rest of his life -- of her life with him.
10                     And if it weren't for these companies'
11               products, she would have been able to do that,
12               but Leo Skolnick was ripped from her at age 75;
13               way too young.
14                     People live a lot longer these days.
15               Beatrice is 86.  She's 86 years old.  And look
16               at her, she's healthy as can be.  Hopefully
17               she's going to live another five, ten, 15
18               years.  Who knows in this --
19 Your Honor, objection, it's
20               not evidence.
21                     THE COURT:  Overruled.  It's argument.
22                     MR. HAMMER:  But we're asking you to
23               award money in this case to compensate her for
24               her loss.
25                     And how do you come up with a figure?

 1                     How do you say, your husband's life was
 2               worth something?
 3                     Well, the tobacco companies said that
 4               Dr. McGregor's time was worth $450 an hour.
 5               They paid her $4,500 to be here two days in a
 6               row to testify to you.  They paid her $9,000 to
 7               be here.  $4,500 a day.
 8                     Page 2.  You all have the verdict form
 9               and you're going to be asked --
10                     You would have checked off these boxes
11               already, and you're going to be asked to figure
12               out what's the total amount of damages
13               sustained by Beatrice Skolnick for the loss of
14               her husband's companionship and protection and
15               for her pain and suffering as a result of his
16               death.
17                     How do you put a number on that?  Leo
18               died in 19 -- it was 1993.  It's been 20 years.
19               Twenty years that she's been without him.
20                     Would he have lived every single one of
21               those days?  Who knows?  Who knows?  But if the
22               man didn't start smoking cigarettes and didn't
23               get addicted to their product and didn't die
24               because of their product, odds are he would
25               have been here.  And he would have been able to

 1               see his granddaughters grow up and graduate.
 2               He would have been able to do all the things he
 3               wanted to do.
 4                     He would have been the one taking
 5               Beatrice on the cruises, instead of Barbara.
 6               He would have been doing those things.  That's
 7               what she's been deprived of, and that's why
 8               we're here today.
 9                     Well, they figured Dr. McGregor's time
10               was worth $450 an hour.  Think about this:
11               Every single day, every single minute -- you
12               heard from Beatrice -- she told you, I think
13               about Leo, I think about him.  It eats away at
14               her.  She hasn't been with another man.  She
15               still loves him.  She still considers herself
16               married to him.  She still has pictures in her
17               house, all over the place.  She thinks about
18               him every day, talks to him, still goes to the
19               grave site.  What is that worth?
20                     Well, it's been 20 years, 365 days a
21               year.  Every minute of the day she thinks about
22               him.  If you put -- give her a thousand dollars
23               a day, a thousand dollars a day for the past 20
24               years, that's less than a dollar a minute.
25               Less than a dollar a minute of her thinking

 1               about him.  Every minute of the day she thinks
 2               about him.  If you do that, at $365 (sic) a
 3               day -- a thousand dollars a day, 365 days a
 4               year, times 20 years, for the past, that's
 5               $7.3 million.  I know that sounds like a lot.
 6               It sounds like a ton of money; but in the
 7               scheme of things, think about this.  They paid
 8               an expert to come in here --
 9 Objection, Your Honor, it's
10               not proper evidence.
11                     THE COURT:  Overruled.  I'm going to
12               allow it.  It's argument.
13                     MR. HAMMER:  -- and tell you that Leo
14               Skolnick was exposed to radiation that didn't
15               even exist.  That's what they paid to try to
16               persuade you not to award Beatrice any money in
17               this case.  Is that fair?
18                     I'll tell you what.  $7.3 million is
19               fair, in light of what they were willing to do.
20                     And then, say, Leo -- Beatrice, for the
21               next -- hopefully -- who knows how long she's
22               going to live -- but, say, five, ten, 15 years.
23               I don't know.  She's 86 years old right now.
24               Say for another five years, that would come out
25               to $1.8 million.  Say for another ten years,

 1               that would come out to $3.6 million.  That's up
 2               to you.  Hopefully she's around for another ten
 3               years.  I would suggest --
 4                     Say only five.  Put in $1.8 million
 5               dollars right there.  I think that's fair to
 6               compensate a woman who's lost the love of her
 7               life, her soulmate, the person that she planned
 8               on spending the rest of her life with at less
 9               than a dollar a minute, compared to what these
10               companies have done, 50 years, throughout the
11               course of Leo Skolnick's life.
12                     You know, we're going to talk about --
13                     Mr. Schlesinger talked to you about
14               punitive damages and whether or not they're
15               warranted in this case.  And they most
16               certainly are.
17                     Danny, what I want to do is go through
18               some photos.  And just start from the
19               beginning.  This is -- go to 2 and then just --
20                     This is Beatrice Skolnick's life and Leo
21               Skolnick's life together.  Pictures of them
22               with their kids, as they grow up.  This was his
23               life.  This was her life with him.  It was
24               special, something that should be valued,
25               something that should be treasured, something

 1               that should be looked upon as something that's
 2               really special.
 3                     People looked at them and said, wow, what
 4               a couple.  They're like -- they're like one.
 5               And you heard Sylvia Gross talk about how
 6               people looked upon Leo and Beatrice like, what
 7               a special relationship.  And they had a great
 8               life together.  But it shouldn't have been cut
 9               short at 75.  There's something wrong with
10               that.  And it's only because of what these
11               companies did that he's gone.
12                     Yeah, you know what?  Leo smoked and he
13               should be held accountable for that.  And he
14               should be held, to some point, to blame for
15               some of that, and Beatrice recognizes that.
16                     Let's go to the verdict form, Page 1.
17               Percentages of fault.  You're going to be asked
18               to determine, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, are
19               they at fault in this case?  Come on.  Of
20               course, they are.  Are they totally blameless?
21               For what you got to see, that very few people
22               get to see, you know now, yeah, they're on
23               Legacy and you can go up there and look and
24               there's books written by Dr. Proctor and
25               other -- other people that talk about the

 1               internal documents; but unless you specifically
 2               look for that, nobody gets to see it.  You guys
 3               got to see something that very few people ever
 4               get to see.  You saw what makes this company
 5               tick.  And what makes this company tick is
 6               money, at the cost of human life and at the
 7               cost of Leo Skolnick.
 8                     So are they responsible?  Yeah.  I would
 9               say that Leo may be responsible for his
10               inability to quit, for his continued smoking,
11               maybe he didn't try hard enough if you all
12               think that, but in comparison to them, I would
13               suggest Leo maybe 20 percent, and these
14               companies, these companies, 40 percent each for
15               a total of a hundred percent.
16                     Beatrice accepts some fault; but a man
17               who starts smoking as a kid, somewhere between
18               ten and 17, according to Dr. Burns, who
19               continues to smoke their product for years and
20               years and years, and is fooled by them, by
21               their advertising, by what they're saying to
22               the public, our product, don't worry about
23               it --
24                     Picture this.  1954, when the science
25               started coming out, imagine the difference if

 1               they would have taken out this Frank Statement
 2               and it would have said:  A Frank Statement to
 3               smokers --
 4                     Instead of saying we take the
 5               responsibility for our smokers and we're going
 6               to hire scientists, think about if they took
 7               out a full-page ad that said this:  A Frank
 8               Statement to Smokers:  Quit, because it will
 9               kill you.
10                     Imagine if they did that, what impact
11               that would have had over the next 50 years on
12               smokers, what impact that would have had on a
13               man like Leo Skolnick.
14                     In 1954, when the science started coming
15               out, and the tobacco companies took out an ad,
16               instead of saying we're going to hire the best
17               scientists, we're going to care about our
18               smokers, we're going to care about our
19               customers, we're going to do the right thing,
20               imagine if they said and spent $450,000 on an
21               ad in every major newspaper across the states,
22               and said, we're going to take out a Frank
23               Statement, quit, because it will kill you.
24               What impact would that have had?
25                     We wouldn't have had all the deaths we've

 1               had over the years.  And Leo Skolnick would
 2               have quit.  Because that's what the companies
 3               that made the product told their own customers.
 4                     If they really would have cared --
 5                     That's what a responsible company does.
 6               That's what a company that cares about their
 7               customers does.  And in the --
 8                     In America -- in America -- corporations,
 9               yeah, they're here to make money; but if you're
10               going to make money, do it the right way, don't
11               kill people.  Don't kill people for a product.
12               That's what they've done.
13                     And they continue to do it, which is why
14               we ask you to hold them to be responsible,
15               which is why we think the amount of money we're
16               asking for, 7.3 million for past pain and
17               suffering, 1.8 million for future pain and
18               suffering, that's reasonable under the
19               circumstances.
20                     And that's why we're asking you to check
21               off that box that these companies should be
22               punished.  They should be, because they haven't
23               changed.  Nothing's changed.  They still do it.
24               Still do it.
25                     Beatrice Skolnick misses Leo

 1               tremendously.
 2                     Go to Number 8.  Beatrice doesn't want to
 3               be here.  She would rather have spent the last
 4               20-plus years beside Leo, not in a courtroom.
 5                     Do you think that's how she wants to
 6               spend her life at 86 years old, in a courtroom?
 7               I think you all know better than that.  She's
 8               here for justice for Leo.  You all --
 9                     As Mr. Schlesinger said, you all have
10               great power, great power.  You have the
11               opportunity today, in your deliberations, to
12               turn to these companies, some of the most
13               powerful companies in the world, and say, what
14               you all have done for the past 50 years, and
15               continue to do today, is just wrong.  We -- we,
16               as citizens of this great country, are not
17               going to tolerate it, we're not going to put up
18               with it.
19 Objection, Your Honor,
20               "send a message" argument.
21                     THE COURT:  Excuse me?
22 "Send a message," you've
23               ruled out.
24                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
25                     MR. HAMMER:  That's --

 1                     THE COURT:  Go ahead.
 2                     MR. HAMMER:  We are not going to tolerate
 3               it.  We think what you did was wrong, and we
 4               think what you did --
 5 Your Honor, you just
 6               sustained that.
 7                     THE COURT:  Sustained.
 8 What you told him he can't
 9               do --
10                     THE COURT:  We've got two people arguing
11               the same thing.  Let's move on.
12                     MR. HAMMER:  As far as a punishment,
13               check off that box so that we can proceed to
14               the next phase.
15                     As far as damages in this case, what
16               these companies did damaged Beatrice Skolnick's
17               life.  And it's not going to bring Leo back.
18               You can't do that in a courtroom.
19                     All we can do is say to these companies,
20               you took somebody that Beatrice Skolnick loved
21               away from her.
22                     Seventy-five years old, the man should
23               not have died at that age.  You see pictures of
24               him.  The guy's looking good; he's looking
25               healthy.  You saw pictures with his shirt off.

 1               The guy was in good shape, in good shape until
 2               the cancerous stuff that he ingested day in and
 3               day out developed a tumor in his lung and
 4               killed him.
 5                     And it was only because of this company's
 6               product, the nicotine-delivery device, that
 7               they highly engineered, that they perfected
 8               into this little product, that if you use it as
 9               intended, you use it like they marketed it,
10               it's ultimately going to kill you.
11                     And they knew that for 50 years, and hid
12               it from the American public, hid it from Leo.
13               That's why we're here, to seek justice.
14                     Mr. Schlesinger will have a chance to
15               speak to you after defense counsel talks to
16               you.  I ask you to pay careful attention to
17               what defense counsel says, and then I ask you
18               to pay careful attention to Mr. Schlesinger's
19               final argument, too.
20                     We've proven our case by a greater weight
21               of the evidence and then some.  Give Beatrice
22               the justice she seeks.  That's what we ask you.
23                     Thank you very much.


20                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  If you can fill the
21             unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of
22             distance run, then yours is the world and all
23             that is in it.  What is more, you will be a man
24             my son.
25                   So I have a little bit of time left to

 1             justify our position in the case, and I'm going
 2             to jump in and try to rip through a bunch of
 3             the stuff.
 4                   And to the extent I feel something needs
 5             to be unmasked, that's what I'm going to do.
 6             I'm going to start right now with the issue of
 7             addiction.  I didn't think I would have to
 8             address it as much as I did.  But right out of
 9             the box, I want to see number 60, please.
10                   All right.  Now, the Surgeon General '10s
11             report.  I'll tell you right now, if you're
12             still taking notes, write down page 16 and page
13             17.  In page 16 and page 17 of this book is
14             everything you need to know about a filter
15             fraud that went on for decades from 1966 until
16             the year 2008, at which time the FTC rescinded
17             its guidance.
18                   It permitted, because it had been misled
19             by the tobacco companies that said we'll give
20             them a double, a triple, a quadruple filter.
21             We'll give them the psychological crutch to
22             keep smoking.  The illusion of filtration is
23             just as important as the fact of filtration.
24                   And we saw a historian, we saw a witness
25             to history, Dr. Burns, he was in essence the --

 1             the man of the Surgeon General for decades when
 2             he was being fooled.
 3                   You saw, if you look at the demeanor of
 4             the witness, the regret, the lives lost, the
 5             disappointment in that man's attitude because
 6             he was misled.  They had a filter.  The machine
 7             smoked the cigarette.  It had ventilation holes
 8             in it.
 9                   The machine misread the fact that the
10             smoker compensated, covered the holes, drew in
11             deeper inhalations and got the nicotine, which
12             is all that smoking is, that they needed to
13             sustain their addiction.  Without nicotine, our
14             business would collapse.
15                   Without nicotine, there would be no
16             smoking.
17                   And finally, after the revelation in 2000
18             of the internal documents and the analysis by
19             scientists, the FTC, the Federal Trade
20             Commission said:  We're rescinding our
21             guidance.  You can't advertise that filters are
22             better.  You can't use that health reassurance.
23                   It's to create the controversy without
24             actually denying it.  All of the FTC reports
25             are also in evidence talk about the

 1             advertising.  It always shows youthful, healthy
 2             people.  It never addresses the health issues.
 3                   We had to give the smokers a
 4             psychological crutch.  In 2008, you'll see in
 5             page 16 and 17, in this book here.  They had to
 6             rescind their guidance and no longer finally
 7             could you say that filters are safer.  A
 8             half -- 450,000 people a year are still dying.
 9                   There's been no reduction in death.  They
10             are trying to say that filters are safer.  Is
11             that like saying if you fall off a 50-story
12             building, that is safer than falling off a
13             75-story building?
14                   Finally, from 1966 to 2008, 42 years,
15             they figured it out.  And in 16 and 17, we read
16             it to you during trial.  It's really long
17             language.  But it says the industry was so far
18             ahead of us on this, they knew so much more, it
19             took decades for the public health authorities
20             to figure it out.
21                   And they make my point.  They proved my
22             case for me.  They showed that my client relied
23             because they say:  The public health
24             authorities say, yeah, try to quit if you can.
25             But if you can't, smoke these filters, they're

 1             better for you.  Of course he saw it.
 2                   And Mr. Belasic -- these are good
 3             lawyers.  Mr. Belasic is picking and choosing.
 4             He's decided my long-dead client, what he did
 5             see and didn't see.
 6                   My client saw the Reader's Digest, but he
 7             didn't see all of the repetitive, forceful
 8             rebuttals of the Reader's Digest, and that's a
 9             document in evidence too, where they said we're
10             going to forcefully refute what the Reader's
11             Digest is saying.
12                   The makers of the Reader's Digest would
13             be spinning in their graves, because they were
14             anti-tobacco, they were smart.  But they were
15             drowned out.
16                   This document talks about advertising.
17             In one day, the tobacco companies spend more
18             money in advertising than the entire public
19             health authority on smoking and health spends
20             in a year.  They drowned out the message.
21                   And they, in the Engle findings say, they
22             misled, they concealed, they were guilty of
23             conspiracy and fraud.  And they did it with the
24             intent that their customers would rely.
25                   My client, Mr. Skolnick, was their ideal

 1             customer.  He did what they wanted to do.  They
 2             didn't want him to quit.  They wanted him to
 3             keep smoking.
 4                   What makes you smoke, nicotine.  That is
 5             the only thing that makes you smoke.
 6                   It's deceptively put in a package to make
 7             it look normal.  But the fact of the matter is,
 8             nicotine addiction is what causes disease.
 9                   Nicotine addiction is the fundamental
10             reason that individuals persist in using
11             tobacco products, and this persistent tobacco
12             use contributes to many diseases described in
13             this report.
14                   See, nicotine addiction is the
15             fundamental reason that individuals persist in
16             using tobacco products, and this persistent
17             tobacco use contributes to the many diseases in
18             this report.
19                   Without the compound nicotine, there
20             would be no smoking.  If nicotine were taken
21             out of our product, the entire market would
22             collapse and we would lose our businesses
23             overnight.
24                   And they didn't want to do it, and they
25             made a decision.  It was a grisly, gruesome

 1             decision that's cost the lives of 12 million
 2             Americans.  Now that is reprehensible.  That
 3             calls for a day of reckoning.
 4                   Mr. Skolnick was a generic smoker, one of
 5             the many who relied on the public health's
 6             reassurance, and what chance did Mr. Skolnick
 7             have of figuring this out if they had Dr. Burns
 8             fooled.
 9                   By the way, they're quoting from my
10             experts.  Dr. Burns said my man, Mr. Skolnick,
11             was highly addicted.  Dr. Proctor said they put
12             together the greatest -- the greatest
13             conspiracy, the greatest distraction campaign
14             in the history of the world and that it cost
15             millions of lives.
16                   So ...
17                   In 1989, two factors refute the argument
18             smoking is a matter of free choice.  Most
19             smokers start smoking as teenagers and then
20             become addicted.
21                   And this is from the memo that says --
22             this is from an internal memo:  Cigarette
23             smoking -- September 9, 1980, cigarette smoking
24             is more addictive than using heroin.  This is
25             what they knew.

 1                   Remember, they denied it.  They lambasted
 2             it.  They said the Surgeon General was
 3             intentionally misleading the public.  And
 4             that's the things that Mr. Skolnick was
 5             hearing.
 6                   I don't think the questions I now raise
 7             are academic.  The lawyers remind us I'm told
 8             that the entire matter of addiction is the most
 9             potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have
10             in a lung cancer cigarette case.
11                   I'm in a lung cancer cigarette case.  I
12             am a prosecuting attorney, and I am telling you
13             30 years later, they're still able to use this
14             defense before you --
15                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Objection, Your Honor.
16                   THE COURT:  Sustained.
17                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Your Honor.
18                   THE COURT:  Disregard the last statement
19             of counsel, please.
20                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  The language I heard
21             from Mr. Belasic is a tautology.  In the same
22             voice that he says:  We now agree it's
23             addictive, he then denies it's addictive.
24                   Because if you say, oh, well, he wasn't
25             addictive, because he could have quit.  That's

 1             got nothing to do with addiction.  When he says
 2             if he was addicted, he could have chosen to
 3             quit and therefore he caused his own disease,
 4             that's a tautology.  That's a denial of
 5             addiction.  That's saying addiction doesn't
 6             exist.  It's just a habit.
 7                   It is one of the most powerful addictions
 8             known to man.  It is the greatest addictive
 9             substance in this country.  44 million people
10             are smoking cigarettes regularly.  440,000 a
11             year are dying, and they're going to continue
12             to die because they are continuing to addict
13             children.  Because there is no smoking.  There
14             is no business without replacement smokers
15             under 18 years of age.  Little adolescent
16             brains.  That is what is reprehensible.
17                   And it isn't Mr. Skolnick, who obviously
18             was a smoker at a very young age, who fit into
19             the category of smokers that Dr. Burns talked
20             about, who met his wife in 1947 smoking Camels,
21             an RJR product, and I apologize that the arc of
22             the moral universe is long, but it bends
23             towards justice that I am not able to produce a
24             95-year-old man in this courtroom for you to
25             testify I was one of the street toughs, I

 1             guarded those hoodlums' cars, we bought Lucy
 2             cigarettes with the pennies we made.
 3                   I'm sorry I can't produce that.  They
 4             want to be rewarded for that?
 5                   Not one time did these gentlemen -- and I
 6             will say they are fine gentlemen, and they did
 7             a great job.  They gave a good closing
 8             argument.  Very convincing, they stitched
 9             things together.
10                   But not once did they address the
11             documents.  And you know what the road to
12             redemption is, recognizing and apologizing
13             something when something has been wrong --
14                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Your Honor.
15                   MR. BELASIC:  Objection.
16                   THE COURT:  Sustained.
17                   Counsel.
18                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
19                   We take our fair share of responsibility.
20             Our fair share of responsibility.  We want to
21             be candid.  We want to be transparent.  We want
22             to say Mr. Skolnick did not have the sufficient
23             internal motivation that met the external
24             support.
25                   Remember what Dr. Burns said, to allow

 1             him to quit before he died like so many other
 2             dependent smokers like him.
 3                   We wish he did, and he wants to say,
 4             okay, we'll take some responsibility.  They are
 5             not taking any.  There was not an admission
 6             that maybe what we did over those --
 7                   MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor,
 8             sustained.
 9                   THE COURT:  Overruled.  I'm going to
10             allow that argument.
11                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  There was not -- they
12             may admit, they may -- on that board, we put
13             40, 40 and 20.  They said even if you agree he
14             was a class member, even if you get through all
15             that and class membership is only -- was he
16             dependent on cigarettes, the nicotine in the
17             cigarettes, yes, he was.
18                   Did that drive that disease?  Yes, it
19             did.  And did that result in a disease process?
20             It absolutely did.
21                   Where is Dr. Rosenthal's --
22                   MR. GDANSKI:  50.
23                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  I had it here.
24                   MR. GDANSKI:  It's up.
25                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.

 1                   Did you want me to bring more witnesses?
 2             I could have brought everyone.  I could have
 3             brought every doctor.  When would it have been
 4             that you would have come out of the box?  I
 5             don't know.  But I got a distinct impression
 6             that you'd heard enough.
 7                   So we put on experts and independent
 8             treatings and we put on the records from
 9             Dr. Rosenthal that says history of colon cancer
10             without recurrence.  He was cured of the
11             disease.
12                   Did I finish with the Shook Hardy?
13                   MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.
14                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can we show Horrigan?
15                   MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor,
16             violates your order -- may we approach?
17                   THE COURT:  Sure.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
25                   THE COURT:  Go ahead, sir.  I'm sorry.

 1                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  What I was saying --
 2             and we're going to pull up another video before
 3             we talk about post-'82 matters.
 4                   But again, the nicotine stains the
 5             smoking.  The doubt campaign, the controversy
 6             campaign sustains the psychological crutch that
 7             permits people to continue smoking.
 8                   Mr. Skolnick, through his loving wife,
 9             has said I want to accept some responsibility.
10             I said, we didn't have to do that.  Volunteered
11             to say maybe our human weaknesses were not
12             enough.  Maybe we could have tried harder.
13                   Whether or not she quit and he didn't
14             quit just means she was able to quit, he was
15             unable to quit because he was addicted.
16                   If his sister died of a disease and he
17             kept smoking, all the more reason to show
18             that's that dependence on nicotine.
19                   But we want to accept a fair share of
20             blame.  You may think -- and I love Ham --
21             Steve Hammer, we grew up since 12 years old.
22                   MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.
23                   THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.
24                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  I think he gave too
25             much percentage to the Skolnicks.

 1                   My view of the evidence I would argue to
 2             you would be that the vast majority of smokers
 3             in those ages of innocence with the doctors and
 4             everything else and those kids that started
 5             that were never told that the tobacco companies
 6             never leveled with, never came clean with don't
 7             really deserve any meaningful measure.
 8                   I want you to know.  You don't have to
 9             give 20 percent.  You could give less.  And in
10             all candor, you can give more.  You can say,
11             you know what?  It's 25.  You could say it's
12             50/50.  You can do any number combination you
13             want because you have the power.  All we're
14             doing is making suggestions.
15                   If $9 million in compensatory damages is
16             too much and Mr. Skolnick may not have been
17             here to see us in this courtroom because it's
18             been so many years, he would be in his late
19             90s, so be it.  Adjust accordingly.  Whatever
20             the simultaneous ages they live with together,
21             you consider that.  Whatever you think is fair.
22                   We're obligated on behalf of our client
23             to give you some help in that regard.
24                   Okay.  Go.
25                   (The video clip was played and taken down

 1                   to the best of the reporter's ability as
 2                   follows:)
 3                   VOICE:  Earlier this week the
 4             R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company took out this ad
 5             in a number of newspapers and magazines calling
 6             for an open debate about smoking.
 7                   In brief, the ad contends that medical
 8             studies which show that cigarette smoking
 9             causes disease are ignoring significant
10             evidence to the contrary.
11                   VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause
12             cancer, yes or no?
13                   VOICE:  It is not known whether
14             cigarettes cause cancer.  Has not been causally
15             established.
16                   VOICE:  Cigarette smoking, no causal
17             relationship between cigarette smoking and
18             emphysema?
19                   VOICE:  Despite all the research today,
20             there has been no causal link established.
21                   VOICE:  No causal relationship between
22             cigarette smoking and heart disease?
23                   VOICE:  No.  As a matter of fact, there
24             are studies that while we are accused of being
25             associated with heart disease, there have been

 1             studies conducted over ten years that would say
 2             again that science is still puzzled over these
 3             forces.
 4                   (Video clip concluded.)
 5                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now that's 1984.  This
 6             is after 1982.  We want to get to punishment
 7             damages, you find reliance after that period of
 8             time, and certainly that's just one of many.
 9                   I will tell you this.  Let's talk about
10             Dr. McGregor again.  More than I want to have
11             to talk about Dr. McGregor.  The ATSDR that I
12             cross-examined with, the governmental agency
13             that deals with toxic substances, doesn't
14             classify natural or uranium as a cancer-causing
15             agent.
16                   And we went into a challenge over if
17             something has radiation, how dangerous is it?
18             It depends on how radioactive it is, and there
19             weren't any nuclear bombs or enriched uranium
20             on that site.  She couldn't cite any amount --
21                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Objection, Your Honor,
22             contrary to the evidence.
23                   THE COURT:  Overruled.
24                   Ladies and gentlemen, you are the finders
25             of the fact.  You recall what the testimony

 1             was.  This is argument of counsel.
 2                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  She thought she said
 3             there might have been 100 pounds of enriched
 4             uranium that went through there.
 5                   But the fact of the matter is that over a
 6             20-year period of time, 10 million pounds of
 7             natural uranium, and this is -- uranium didn't
 8             stay there, it got passed through, and counsel
 9             for defendant told you that Mrs. Skolnick
10             didn't know what they were doing in that plant
11             back then.  She didn't find out until 10, 20
12             years after she moved there.
13                   But uranium decays slowly.  4.5 billion
14             years.  Not a million years.  If you're going
15             to know anything there is to know about an
16             elemental substance such as uranium, a
17             natural-occurring uranium, you must know the
18             half-life in order to know the radioactivity.
19                   Let's go to the sworn testimony of
20             Dr. McGregor.  Number 77, please.
21                   Isn't it true no studies which has been
22             performed support the conclusion that the
23             people who lived in the Skolnicks'
24             neighborhood, including the Skolnicks, were at
25             increased risk of development of lung cancer.

 1             Isn't that true?
 2                   That's true.
 3                   Do you remember those questions and did
 4             you give those answers to those questions when
 5             you were deposed?
 6                   Yes.
 7                   Isn't it true you cannot specifically
 8             demonstrate the presence of any enhanced levels
 9             of radioactivity on the properties of plaintiff
10             surrounding the facility?
11                   True.
12                   You don't have a numerical amount or
13             specific amount of radiation exposure that
14             Mr. Skolnick had during his lifetime, do you?
15                   No, I don't.
16                   But you do know he had an ongoing
17             continuous exposure to cancer-causing chemicals
18             in cigarettes, including the radioactive and
19             radiation cancer-causing chemical polonium?
20             PO210 on the elemental, the periodic table that
21             we learn about in high school.
22                   Before he moved to Hicksville in the late
23             '50s, right?
24                   Right.
25                   And all the way through until the day he

 1             died.
 2                   Polonium is the radioactive substance in
 3             cigarettes that's known to cause cancer.  We
 4             put it up on the board.  It's in the book.  If
 5             you don't believe me, look it up.
 6                   Page 100 on is a whole chapter on
 7             nicotine addiction.  It isn't free choice.  It
 8             constrains free choice.  Without nicotine,
 9             there would be no smoking.
10                   Now,let me show you something.
11                   Let's go to 009.
12                   Remember they talked about Mr.--
13             Lombardi.  Sorry, sir -- talked about there was
14             a release.  A release, by the way, that
15             occurred before the Skolnicks moved to the
16             neighborhood, a release into the air, from some
17             stack, and maybe there was some uranium that
18             burned and it got in the stack.
19                   Talking about fullerenes, west --
20             buckyballs, Westminster (sic) fullerenes.
21                   The case is about smoking and cancer.
22             We're not here to talk about nuclear power
23             plants.  They have injected themselves as a
24             distraction.
25                   See what it says here, on one time, one

 1             episode, concentration of 1100 disintegrations
 2             per minute per meter cubed was found once in
 3             June 1957 before my clients moved there.
 4                   Now, this is an example of the skill of
 5             the witness that never did a lung cancer case,
 6             never did a radiation case.  The only atomic
 7             workers she had anything to do with was a paper
 8             study where they would send a file on workers'
 9             comp claims about whether they got cataracts.
10                   And she admitted this is the first time
11             she's ever done it.  And the amount of money
12             she earned was less than what she admitted to.
13             Until we added it up, and it seemed
14             extraordinary.  You'll consider whether or not
15             it was.
16                   Now, 1100 DPMs per minute.  She said by
17             the way, as an example of her great knowledge
18             of this technical subject, which out of
19             thousands of pages, she pulled a couple of
20             pages out, that it was dissipations a minute.
21             It's not dissipations a minute.  It's
22             disintegrations per minute.  It's when little
23             atoms are jumping out of a radioactive
24             substance.
25                   Let's talk about 15.  Now, let's go to

 1             the first page -- you see what this says?
 2                   Transmitted herewith is the following
 3             inspection report involving noncompliance.
 4             Sylvania Corning Nuclear Corporation.  They
 5             showed you that.  You see what this says?
 6             Bayside, New York.
 7                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Your Honor --
 8                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Over in Queens, in a
 9             whole 'nother part in town.
10                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Your Honor --
11                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is not Hicksville.
12                   THE COURT:  Excuse me, Counsel.  There's
13             an objection, please.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
22                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Here we go.  Can I
23             start my time again, Mr. Clerk?
24                   THE CLERK:  21 minutes left.
25                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  So, moving on.

 1                   Now, this is the document that was in
 2             evidence.  It's PMUP 025088004.  I will show
 3             you several parts of it.  But here's what it
 4             says here:  Sylvania Corning Nuclear
 5             Corporation, and there is an address, Bayside,
 6             New York.
 7                   Now, remember, that's not the same
 8             address as Hicksville.  Counsel, when he had
 9             the witness on the stand, was very careful,
10             often referred to Sylvania, Sylvania, Sylvania.
11                   However, I want to show you where this
12             document refers to with regard to this release,
13             even though it occurred before my clients ever
14             moved there.  So that alone rules it out as
15             having relevance to my clients.  Anything that
16             puffed in the air couldn't have bothered my
17             clients when they weren't there.
18                   But, here is the address.  Bayside, New
19             York.  That's Queens.  That's full on the other
20             side of town, 12 miles away.  It's nowhere near
21             Hicksville.  Nowhere near Westbury.
22                   Next entry.
23                   Now, there are dates here on the
24             compliance inspection report.  This is from the
25             same document.  You'll have it in evidence.

 1             Look at it yourself, and you make the
 2             determination.
 3                   It also shows the same address, Bayside,
 4             New York.  Name and address of licensee,
 5             Sylvania Corning.  Here is Bayside.  Report.
 6             It's a compliance inspection report.
 7                   Next, please.
 8                   Now, remember there was paragraph 15,
 9             1100 dissipations per minute or 1100
10             disintegrations per minute in excess.  Look
11             here.  The inspection report herein was
12             confined to an examination of uses of licensed
13             byproduct and source material and only the
14             Bayside facility was visited.
15                   So, it's a mistake, we submit, that was
16             made by Dr. McGregor in trying to tell you that
17             something happened near the family's house that
18             could have let something go into the air.  It
19             was at a facility that was over 12 miles away.
20                   Is there anything else on that?  All
21             right.  Thank you.
22                   Let's go on to the next thing.
23                   That's paragraph 10.  The inspection was
24             Bayside.  They discussed it and addressed it as
25             if it's Hicksville.  It was an error.  That's

 1             it out of 5,000 pages.  It wasn't the same
 2             place.
 3                   Now, let me put up 30, please.
 4                   The -- there's a -- there's an old story
 5             about the man who had a field, and one day a
 6             goat got loose from a neighboring farm and came
 7             into the man's field and ate all his cabbages.
 8                   And in the fuss that ensued, the defense
 9             was, I don't have a goat.  And if I did have a
10             goat, he didn't eat your cabbages.  And if he
11             did eat your cabbages --
12                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Your Honor --
13                   THE COURT:  Sustained.  This is improper
14             argument, Counsel.  Approach.
15                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's improper?
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
 3                   THE COURT:  Again, let me just remind
 4             you, ladies and gentlemen, what counsel says is
 5             not evidence.  That goes for both sides and all
 6             three counsel.  What these documents say or
 7             don't say is what you have to decide as a part
 8             of your deliberations in this case.
 9                   So if counsel says something,
10             inadvertently or otherwise -- any of them --
11             that you find different from the evidence, you
12             go by what the evidence is in this case, by
13             what the document actually says, rather than
14             what counsel, either for the defendant or the
15             plaintiff says it says.
16                   Go ahead.
17                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
18             Court.
19                   Okay.  And --
20                   THE COURT:  Without the homilies.
21                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can I talk about the
22             cabbage?
23                   THE COURT:  No, sir.  You can't -- we're
24             not going to talk about the stories.
25                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  I wasn't sure what

 1             objection we were on.
 2                   I'm sorry.
 3                   So anyway, we're going to talk about some
 4             of the defenses in the case.  And I will tell
 5             you that a lot of material, if you take one
 6             thing from me at face value, I will not
 7             intentionally misrepresent anything to you.
 8                   I know you guys have all the evidence,
 9             you've taken extensive notes, paid attention,
10             you're taking this seriously.  You will get
11             this right.  That's what we trust the jury
12             system to do, trust you independent folks to
13             get it right.
14                   The defendants suggest a multiplicity of
15             defenses, and I suggest that by suggesting so
16             many of them, it dilutes the overall message of
17             their defenses.  They say he was not addicted.
18             They say he did not have lung cancer.
19                   What was interesting was Mr. Belasic in
20             his arguments to you when he was talking about
21             the radiation and the claims that Mrs. Skolnick
22             made was drawing a distinction and said he
23             didn't die from colon cancer.  He didn't die
24             from colon cancer, in making the argument with
25             regard to the radiation claim and the words

 1             "lung cancer" and "colon cancer" on her
 2             handwritten stipulation.
 3                   He said it must have been because it's
 4             wrongful death, as if she knew what that legal
 5             term meant when she testified that she did not
 6             understand it at the time.  She filled out a
 7             form.  But he said she must have known what it
 8             meant, because he didn't die of colon cancer.
 9                   At what point does that belie?  What does
10             that undermine from one of his defenses?  He
11             wants you to think that he did die of colon
12             cancer.
13                   Didn't he say to you he didn't die of
14             lung cancer.  You have a reason to believe he
15             died of colon cancer that spread to his lungs,
16             and that when he went down to the University of
17             Miami for experimental chemotherapy, they used
18             drugs that were usually used for colon cancer,
19             as if to suggest that he had colon cancer.
20                   So there's inconsistent shifting
21             justification.  But he didn't have lung cancer
22             or he had colon cancer that all the doctors
23             missed, despite all the colonoscopies and the
24             doctor's record that said he was cured.  And
25             another doctor that testified here that said he

 1             was cured of colon cancer more than ten years
 2             out.
 3                   And then they said the chemotherapy was
 4             for colon cancer, even though Dr. Davis said it
 5             wasn't.  He worked with Dr. Sridhar on the
 6             complicated cases of the non-operative tumors,
 7             those nasty adenocarcinomas get deep into the
 8             lungs from filter cancer.  From sucking harder
 9             and deeper to get that all-needed nicotine into
10             the lungs to hit the brain.
11                   If he had lung cancer, it was from
12             radiation.  That was another defense.  It's all
13             his responsibility anyway.  And, again, as
14             His Honor said, you decide who bears a relevant
15             proportion of fault.
16                   We're willing to take our fair share of
17             the blame.  We ask you to assign to them the
18             fair share of the blame they're not willing to
19             take.  That's not unreasonable.  That's the job
20             you can perform when you look at what's been
21             done in this case.
22                   Then it's all his responsibility anyway.
23             He should have known better.  He never should
24             have trusted us.
25                   Why didn't they know, if everybody knew

 1             in the '60s, in the '70s, in the '80s, if
 2             everybody knew, why didn't the tobacco
 3             executives in New York City and Winston-Salem
 4             and Raleigh-Durham, why didn't they know that
 5             this was the problem, and why didn't they come
 6             out and embrace the findings instead of reject
 7             the findings and embrace what -- the harms
 8             were?
 9                   They said:  We are going to get that
10             doubt controversy to reassure people.  We are
11             going to lie.
12                   And the Engle findings that are so
13             important say the cigarette is a dangerous and
14             defective product.  It is defective.  This is
15             defective because it is unreasonably dangerous.
16             When used for the purpose for which it is
17             intended, it kills 50 percent of the people
18             that use it.
19                   No other consumer product on earth meets
20             that bill.  It's an institutionalized form of
21             irrational madness in our society that such a
22             deadly product exists.
23                   If some Red Bull drink sends a teenager
24             to the ER, it gets banned and there's
25             Congressional hearings.

 1                   But when you have a tobacco epidemic like
 2             we do, it's hard to get past it.
 3                   Here is the position.  He was not
 4             addicted, but they didn't call a witness to say
 5             he was not addicted.  They could have had an
 6             addiction psychiatrist, a neurologist, a
 7             doctor, anybody they wanted.  They have no
 8             limit, they have the ability to bring in
 9             experts.  They have no witness.
10                   I was accused a little bit of I'm making
11             a lawyer argument.  I was talking about
12             Uranium-238.  Well, it's only lawyer argument
13             here that dispels the notion that my man was
14             addicted and depended on nicotine.
15                   There is no scientific evidence.  The
16             uniform proof from lay people and doctors is he
17             was addicted.
18                   He didn't have lung cancer?  All the
19             doctors said he had lung cancer.  And they all
20             said it was from smoking, and nobody said it
21             wasn't from smoking, and their one expert said
22             it was a substantial contributing cause of
23             smoking.
24                   Mr. Lombardi says I can't meet my
25             standard of proof because maybe there was some

 1             radiation.  I showed you my cool concurring
 2             cause pictogram to show you that in order to be
 3             a legal cause of disease, smoking need not be
 4             the only cause.  It can act in combination with
 5             a nuke.  So nuke 'em.  Nuke 'em.  But it
 6             doesn't stop him from having been -- caused to
 7             have lung cancer.
 8                   THE CLERK:  Ten minutes left.
 9                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.
10                   If he had lung cancer from radiation.
11             She didn't say that.  She said it is a risk
12             factor.
13                   Can you say it was a contributing cause?
14             She did not say that.  She specifically
15             couldn't say it, didn't testify to it.
16                   The only thing she testified that meets
17             the legal evidentiary burden under the law --
18             the instruction the Court will give you is that
19             their own expert admitted a contributing cause
20             of Mr. Skolnick's lung cancer was smoking.
21                   So it is uniform.
22                   The business about it's all his
23             responsibility anyway.  They said they accepted
24             smoker's health as the paramount responsibility
25             and promised to stop making it if it was ever

 1             proven to be harmful.
 2                   That was a dodge.  That was to give
 3             people reassurance.  They haven't stopped
 4             making it.  They haven't slowed down making it.
 5             They haven't made a safer cigarette.  If you
 6             take the nicotine out, there won't be any
 7             smoking.
 8                   He should have known better?  They spend
 9             billions of dollars.  Dr. Proctor testified
10             about the beautiful health reassurance
11             strategy.  He talked about that.
12                   And he never should have trusted us.  And
13             one of the things I really -- hey, you messed
14             up.  You trusted us.  It's on you.
15                   He was the perfect customer.  They put
16             up -- they put up to convince you that our
17             client doesn't deserve to be one of the
18             people -- and it's not just him, but all the
19             others that were hurt.  You'll look --
20                   MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.
21                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  You'll look at the
22             instruction.
23                   THE COURT:  Counsel, just talk about this
24             case.
25                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  You'll look at the

 1             instruction on the reckless disregard and the
 2             degree of reprehensible conduct that gives
 3             punitive damages, and it says to the smoker and
 4             others.  One of the millions.
 5                   It says it's -- you're looking at
 6             wrongful conduct, not just about Mr. Skolnick.
 7             Ultimately, punitive damages will be about
 8             Mr. Skolnick.
 9                   But if you decide that they need a day of
10             reckoning, they should be penalized, they
11             should be fined.  They should be punished.
12             Because when you speak to them -- you're going
13             to speak to them in the only language they
14             understand.  Money.  That's their lifeblood.
15             That's all they understand.
16                   So when you see that -- I can't believe
17             they put up a statistic, and I admire
18             Mr. Belasic for doing it, because you know, he
19             takes some risks and you see how they work, and
20             I admire that he did it.
21                   But it was amazing to me.  He put up a
22             standard, we did a lot of polls, public opinion
23             polls, only 2 percent of people trusted the
24             tobacco companies.
25                   That's a defense in the case.  You

 1             shouldn't have trusted us because people didn't
 2             trust us.
 3                   We were not worthy of being trusted, and
 4             therefore, that's the defense in the case.
 5                   Next slide.
 6                   We already did the doctor, right?
 7                   (The video clip was played and taken down
 8                   to the best of the reporter's ability as
 9                   follows:)
10                   VOICE:  It really poses the question of
11             whether one is responsible for the other.  And
12             to this question it must be answered insofar as
13             the correlation between lung cancer and
14             cigarette smoking are concerned.  No one knows.
15             It may, it may not.
16                   How can cigarette smoking be the cause of
17             lung cancer if the cause of lung cancer is, as
18             yet, unknown?
19                   VOICE:  It is not known whether
20             cigarettes cause cancer, it has not been
21             causally established.  There have been studies
22             conducted over ten years.  And I would say
23             again --
24                   MR. LOMBARDI:  Your Honor, this is a
25             repeat.

 1                   THE COURT:  Overruled.
 2                   VOICE:  -- that science is still puzzled
 3             over these forces.
 4                   VOICE:  I certainly wouldn't be in the
 5             business if I thought cigarettes were harmful
 6             to people.
 7                   VOICE:  Are you saying cigarettes are
 8             harmless?
 9                   VOICE:  I don't know that.  I don't know
10             that they're harmful or harmless.  What I'm
11             saying is someone should find out.
12                   VOICE:  I think if the company as a whole
13             believed that cigarettes were really harmful,
14             we would not be in the business.  We're a very
15             moralistic company.
16                   I think there's a great deal of doubt as
17             to whether or not cigarettes are harmful.  You
18             will discover there is a great deal of doubt
19             with regard to whether or not smoking causes
20             all these diseases which are alleged to be
21             caused by smoking.
22                   VOICE:  But I don't think there's a
23             causal relationship established between
24             cigarette smoking and any disease.  If there
25             were, Diane, I don't think there would be a

 1             cause or the effect without a cause, and we all
 2             know that happens.
 3                   VOICE:  We don't know what causes cancer
 4             in general right now, so I think that we may
 5             find out what causes cancer, and we may find
 6             out some relationship which has yet to be
 7             proven.
 8                   (Video clip concluded.)
 9                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now put up the -- this
10             is one of the internal documents.
11                   The top men in these corporations, the
12             CEOs, the top attorneys, the top scientists
13             were involved in all of these documents,
14             millions of them.
15                   Who ain't for more money?
16                   I would be more cautious in using the
17             pharmic-medical model -- do we really want to
18             tout cigarette smoke as a drug?  It is, of
19             course, but there are dangerous FDA
20             implications to having such conceptualizations
21             go beyond these walls.
22                   The PT47368, please.
23                   Addiction goes in a lot of different
24             ways, and tobacco companies are addicted to
25             money.  That's the dependence they have, on

 1             money.  But there are considerations that must
 2             be balanced with obligation to do the right
 3             thing by your customers, by the public, to the
 4             public, to the human health.
 5                   And that has to be taken into
 6             consideration.  Here is --
 7                   (The video clip was played and taken down
 8                   to the best of the reporter's ability as
 9                   follows:)
10                   VOICE:  Something wonderful happens.
11                   When you change to Philip Morris, you'll
12             feel better.
13                   VOICE:  Did you say I'll feel better
14             smoking Philip Morris?
15                   VOICE:  Yes, you'll feel better, and here
16             are the reasons why.  In case after case,
17             coughs due to smoking disappear.
18                   Parched throat clears up.  That stale
19             smoked out feeling vanishes.
20                   VOICE:  That is wonderful.
21                   VOICE:  When you change to Philip Morris,
22             you really taste your cigarette once again.
23             The clear, clean taste of fine mellow tobacco,
24             and your food will taste better too.
25                   VOICE:  But why do these wonderful things

 1             happen when I change to Philip Morris?
 2                   VOICE:  Because you'll be smoking the one
 3             cigarette with a difference in manufacture, an
 4             important difference that avoids a common cause
 5             of cigarette irritation.
 6                   Day after day, you'll be smoking these
 7             cigarettes recommended by eminent nose and
 8             throat specialists ...
 9                   (Video clip concluded.)
10                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Something wonderful
11             happens when you smoke Philip Morris.  You get
12             emphysema and Buerger's disease and bladder
13             cancer and lung cancer and you die a gruesome
14             death, and illness.
15                   The man that we represent grew up in a
16             time where Now, Voyager was such a romantic
17             thing.  A man lighting a cigarette for a woman
18             was a beautiful thing.
19                   He was addicted for 30 years or more
20             before anyone even began to put what they call
21             a warning, which was nothing more than the 1966
22             word:  Caution, cigarette smoking may be
23             hazardous to your health.
24                   And when they pumped it up in the '70s,
25             to some things like it contains carbon

 1             monoxide, low birth weight and emphysema and
 2             cancer.  Those are the rotating warnings.
 3                   They didn't even say the tobacco
 4             companies say it.  They said the Surgeon
 5             General says it.  And I said that --
 6                   (The video clip was played and taken down
 7                   to the best of the reporter's ability as
 8                   follows:)
 9                   VOICE:  I would like you to rise, and
10             that will be testifying as well with you to
11             rise.  Raise your right hand.  Do you swear
12             that the testimony you are about to give is the
13             truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
14             truth?
15                   VOICES:  I do.
16                   VOICE:  Please consider yourself to be
17             under oath.
18                   VOICE:  Let me begin my questioning on
19             the matter of whether or not nicotine is
20             addictive.  Let me ask you first, and I would
21             like to just go down the row, whether each of
22             you believes that nicotine is not addictive.
23                   I heard virtually all of you touch on it.
24             Just yes or no.  Do you believe nicotine is not
25             addictive?

 1                   VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not
 2             addictive, yes.
 3                   VOICE:  Mr. Johnson?
 4                   VOICE:  Congressman, cigarettes and
 5             nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
 6             definitions of addiction.  There is no
 7             intoxication --
 8                   VOICE:  We'll take that as a "no."
 9                   Again, time is short.  If you could
10             just -- I think each of you believe nicotine is
11             not addictive.  We would like to have this for
12             the record.
13                   VOICE:  I don't believe that nicotine or
14             our products are addictive.
15                   VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not
16             addictive.
17                   VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not
18             addictive.
19                   VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not
20             addictive.
21                   VOICE:  And I, too, believe that nicotine
22             is not addictive.
23                   (Video clip concluded.)
24                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's in April of
25             1994, a year after --

 1                   (The video clip was played and taken down
 2                   to the best of the reporter's ability as
 3                   follows:)
 4                   VOICE:  Do you agree with the Surgeon
 5             General estimate of over 400,000 smokers die --
 6                   VOICE:  I do not agree.
 7                   VOICE:  Do you know how many die each
 8             year?
 9                   VOICE:  I do not know.
10                   VOICE:  Okay.  They agree that smoking
11             causes lung cancer.  Do you agree?
12                   VOICE:  It may.
13                   VOICE:  Do you know whether it does?
14                   VOICE:  I do not.
15                   VOICE:  The medical experts agree that
16             smoking causes emphysema.  Do you agree?
17                   VOICE:  It may.
18                   VOICE:  They agree this smoking causes
19             bladder cancer, stroke, and low birth weight.
20             Do you agree?
21                   VOICE:  It may.
22                   VOICE:  Mr. Campbell, you were also
23             deposed and you said, quote, "To my knowledge
24             it has not been proven that cigarette smoking
25             causes cancer."

 1                   This is a rather passive and puzzling
 2             approach, especially in light of the consensus,
 3             not by some, but all of the scientific
 4             community.  Will you ever be convinced?  And
 5             what evidence are you waiting for?
 6                   Let's have the microphone passed over.
 7                   VOICE:  Yes, I may be convinced.  We
 8             don't know what causes cancer in general right
 9             now, so I think that we may find out what
10             causes cancer, and we may find out some
11             relationship, which has yet to be proven.
12                   (Video clip concluded.)
13                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Character, they say is
14             how you behave when you think nobody is
15             looking.
16                   THE CLERK:  You've used all your time,
17             Mr. Schlesinger.
18                   THE COURT:  Wrap it up, please.
19                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.  I've said and
20             I'll say this book to you again.  America is
21             this industry's ashtray.  They stub out 400 --
22                   MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor.
23                   THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.
24                   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Last thing.
25                   They tell you that it's a legal product.

 1             And it's a common refrain.  And it is a legal
 2             product.  But it isn't legal to sell it to
 3             children.  It isn't legal to sell it to
 4             12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds,
 5             15-year olds, 16-year-olds, and to hook them
 6             when they're most vulnerable, to replace the
 7             smokers that are dying off because of their
 8             deadly product.
 9                   All we ask you to do is consider what
10             you've seen, deliver justice, and I wish you
11             good luck at accomplishing that task.  And
12             thank you so much.
