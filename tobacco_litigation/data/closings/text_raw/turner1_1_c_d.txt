22           MR. HOHNBAUM:  I want to add my thanks for
23      your service and your attention.  Being a juror
24      is not easy.
25           And one of the reasons being a juror is not easy is you are listening to a flood of
2      information in this case, seven or eight days,
3      and it's like you're trying to drink from a
4      fire hose.  And you're not given the
5      instructions, you are not given the law until
6      the end of the case, and there are very good
7      reasons for that.  But it makes it very
8      challenging, as you're listening to evidence,
9      to figure out, how is that evidence going to
10      help me decide the issues in this?
11           And the Plaintiff, except on the statute
12      of limitations, has the burden of proof.  They
13      have to tie what you heard on that witness
14      stand to Ms. Wilkinson.
15           Because this case is not about some
16      smokers, other smokers, people who may have
17      been deceived, many people.  It is about one
18      person who smoked for 50 years, despite knowing
19      from a very young age that it could kill her
20      and ruin her life.  That is not disputed by any
21      of the witnesses you heard from that witness
22      stand.
23           What the Plaintiff did in this case, they
24      called their first witness, live, it was
25      Dr. Cummings.  Right? Dr. Cummings talked to you for about a day
2      and a half about general things.  That's where
3      the generic comes from: general things.
4           Did Mr. -- did Dr. Cummings know anything
5      meaningful about Ms. Wilkinson?  Well, he
6      acknowledged on the stand:  I know when she was
7      born, I know when she died.  I know a couple of
8      brands she smoked.  But I don't know why she
9      smoked, how long she smoked.  I don't know when
10      she smoked a particular brand.  He didn't know,
11      nor did he even try to find out, about
12      Ms. Wilkinson, right?
13           I didn't read the depositions.  I wasn't
14      asked to give opinions specific to
15      Ms. Wilkinson.
16           That was Dr. Cummings' own testimony in
17      this case.
18           And so what Dr. Cummings did is he came in
19      and he told you that everybody smoked, right?
20      Smoking was normalized.  No one knew it was
21      dangerous.  Information was hidden.
22           That's what Dr. Cummings told you about
23      what was going on generally, without knowing
24      what was going on with respect to
25      Ms. Wilkinson. In fact, I asked him:  Do you know whether
2      her parents forbade smoking?  Do you know if
3      her brother warned her 100 times that smoking
4      could kill her?
5           And his honest answer was:  I don't know.
6      I don't know.
7           So they brought you Dr. Cummings, and,
8      again, this is what he didn't know.  He wants
9      to tell you general stuff, but you need to
10      focus to answer the issues on the verdict form,
11      because every issue on the verdict form has one
12      name on it, and it is Ms. Wilkinson.  It is not
13      everybody else.  This is Ms. Wilkinson's issue.
14           They want you, in deciding what
15      Ms. Wilkinson knew -- this is what she knew:
16      She knew about her father telling her it was
17      bad, her brother telling her it was bad, her
18      sister telling her, her first husband, who she
19      married when she was 16 years old, her first
20      husband telling her smoking is bad for her.
21           Sister, the warning labels.  At school, at
22      church.  She was surrounded by warnings
23      throughout her life.
24           And when you heard testimony from her
25      brother Joseph via videotape:  I warned her a hundred times.  Did you hear him say she denied
2      it?  She was confused about it?  She doubted
3      it?  No.
4           When you heard from Malloy, Mr. Malloy and
5      the sister, did anybody say, anybody in this
6      case say she was confused, doubted it or didn't
7      understand what she had been told her entire
8      life?
9           Dr. Cummings comes in here.  He shows
10      documents, campaign of doubt, controversy,
11      confusion, people were confused.  This was
12      working.  He didn't know anything about
13      Ms. Wilkinson.
14           The evidence will -- with Ms. Wilkinson
15      is, she did know.  Is there any evidence in
16      this case that she was confused?  That she
17      doubted it?  That in any way she absorbed the
18      controversy?
19           And the answer to that question is "no,"
20      from her own mouth.
21           At some point in time, if somebody is
22      telling you, wouldn't you expect if it was
23      confused and she doubted, that she would say, I
24      don't believe that, I don't believe that?
25      Well, I'm not so sure about that. Not one single, solitary time in her
2      entire life.
3           Generic testimony from Dr. Cummings, who
4      doesn't know her, versus very specific factual
5      evidence about Ms. Wilkinson, because it is her
6      case.  Plaintiff cannot prove their case by
7      putting up a bunch of offensive documents --
8      and they are offensive -- and say there is some
9      connection to Ms. Wilkinson, because there have
10      to be facts connecting, and there aren't.
11           She knew throughout her entire life, by
12      the people she trusted, the people who were
13      respected in her eyes, the people she loved,
14      the people who knew, she knew were looking out
15      for her, her entire life, and she told those
16      people -- those people told her smoking is
17      going to ruin your life, it is going to kill
18      you, you should stop.
19           Not one single time: confused, doubt.
20           Plaintiff's generic case.  Again,
21      Dr. Cummings.  Did he render an addiction
22      opinion in this case?  Did he say Ms. Wilkinson
23      was addicted?  No.  He wasn't even asked to.
24      He wasn't asked to give that opinion.
25           He comes in, he talks about all regular smokers are addicted, nicotine, can't quit, and
2      addicted smokers continue to smoke until they
3      develop a smoking-related disease.  Okay.  That
4      is Dr. Cummings talking about general people.
5           What do we know about Ms. Wilkinson?
6      Barbara Walsh, who knew her for over 20 years,
7      said she smoked willingly, willfully and
8      enjoyable.
9           That is her contemporary, the person she's
10      seeing on a regular basis for over 15, 20
11      years.
12           And what did Ms. Walsh say about
13      Ms. Wilkinson?  She knew it.  She knew what she
14      was doing.  She knew that smoking could kill
15      her.  How could she not know that smoking could
16      kill her?  She knew it could kill her.
17           And the evidence is she could have quit
18      any time, and I'm going to talk more about
19      that.  She did quit.  And she could have quit
20      at any point in time.
21           Mr. Rosen discussed documents in the '20s
22      and the '70s about marketing to youth and
23      studying youth.
24           I'm not here to defend that.  The question
25      is:  What do documents in the 1970s about youth marketing have to do with Vivian Wilkinson, who
2      was in her 30s and 40s in the 1970s?
3           Where is the dot?  Where is the
4      connection?  Where is the proof?
5           And ask yourself, why are you hearing
6      evidence about documents in the '70s with
7      respect to youth, when she was 30, 40 years
8      old?
9           No one knows why Ms. Wilkinson started
10      smoking.  Mr. Wicks, who knew her best, didn't
11      have any information about that.  He didn't
12      have any information about what brand she
13      smoked right out of the box.
14           And we don't know what brand -- we don't
15      know what brand of cigarettes she smoked before
16      the 1960s, when she was an adult, because the
17      only person who gave you testimony about that,
18      first-hand observation, was Vivian Turner.
19           When she was in elementary school and
20      before that, we don't know what brand she
21      smoked.
22           What did those who knew her tell you about
23      Ms. Wilkinson?  What did the people that knew
24      her tell you?
25           Again, Ms. Walsh.  We are going to talk about Ms. Walsh.  Willingly, willfully,
2      enjoyably for 50 years, knowing that it could
3      kill her and ruin her life.  That is from the
4      family member.
5           I want to start marching through the legal
6      issues and the evidence in this case with the
7      second issue on the verdict form.
8           The second issue on the verdict form is
9      the question of the statute of limitations.  It
10      is the only issue in the case that defense has
11      the burden of proof.
12           And it is an issue, as Mr. Rosen says,
13      that if you resolve this, that the Plaintiff's
14      claim is barred by the statute of limitations,
15      the case is over.  And that is why I want to
16      address it first.
17           And this is the instruction I'm going to
18      march through.  This is the instruction, minus
19      the last paragraph.  The last paragraph tells
20      you what the result is if you answer yes or no.
21           This is the meat of the statute of
22      limitations instruction, and I want to go over
23      that with you.
24           Ms. Wilkinson knew or should have known
25      that she had COPD/emphysema, and the date that we know by now is May 5th, 1990.
2           All three pulmonologists in this case,
3      that is, Dr. Reed, Dr. Gidel and Dr. Farber,
4      all three of them agree that she had COPD in
5      the 1980s.  No dispute in this case that she
6      had the disease.
7           Family members and friends, I'm going to
8      show you this, Mr. Wicks, Ms. Walsh saw her in
9      the '80s with the hallmark symptoms of COPD,
10      and that is shortness of breath.
11           Ms. Wilkinson knew her shortness of breath
12      was caused by smoking.
13           How do we know that?  Do we have to guess
14      at that?  Do we have to speculate about that?
15      How do we know that?
16           She said it.  She said it to her brother.
17      And we are going to play that clip.
18           And Ms. Wilkinson self-treated shortness
19      of breath throughout the 1980s with inhalers.
20      She knew it was caused by smoking.  She was
21      using inhalers to help with her shortness of
22      breath.
23           And there is no evidence in this case,
24      zero evidence, for any other explanation for
25      what was causing her shortness of breath other than COPD.
2           You heard otherwise healthy.  Otherwise
3      healthy.  Excellent health.  Good health.
4      There is no other explanation for why she was
5      short of breath.
6           Barbara, Dr. Reed, Dr. Gidel appeared by
7      transcript.  So we don't have a picture of
8      them, but they all agreed that she had the
9      disease.
10           And I want to point something out, make
11      this very clear:  Reynolds does not need to
12      prove that Ms. Wilkinson was actually diagnosed
13      with COPD/emphysema before May 5th, 1990.
14           The issue is not whether there is a
15      medical record, whether we can prove that she
16      had a diagnosis from a doctor prior to May 5th,
17      1990.  The first records we have are in 1993.
18           We don't have to prove that she was
19      actually diagnosed.
20           The issue for purposes of the defense, the
21      critical event is not when she was diagnosed,
22      but when her COPD/emphysema first manifested
23      itself.
24           We know when her symptoms first manifested
25      itself.  And we know she had the disease, right?  We looked at the PFT from 1993.  The
2      PFT showed that she had very severe COPD in
3      1993, in April of 1993.
4           And there was some discussion about
5      whether or not that was at baseline.  And we
6      are going to talk about that, whether that PFT
7      was at baseline, whether she was at baseline.
8           You heard testimony that you wouldn't give
9      a PFT unless somebody was around baseline.  Why
10      would you do it?  Why would it help you?
11           The fact of matter is, they gave her a
12      PFT, and they gave her a PFT because she was
13      around baseline.  Otherwise, why do it?
14           This is not a debatable proposition.
15      According to her own witnesses, Dr. Gidel and
16      Dr. Reed, did she have severe COPD in 1993?
17           "It is your opinion that Ms. Wilkinson had
18      severe COPD, correct?
19           "Yes.
20           "And based on numbers like this and the
21      spirometry, would you agree it was very severe?
22           "Yes."
23           And remember, folks, this is the grading
24      for COPD.  Very severe is less than 30 percent.
25      Severe is 30 to 49 percent. So even if for some reason she's
2      straddling the severe/very severe, she had
3      COPD.  She was diagnosed with severe or very
4      severe COPD in May of 1990.
5           And we know from every single witness in
6      the case that she had it in the late 1980s, and
7      I don't have to guess at it.  You don't have to
8      guess at it.  Here is the testimony from
9      Dr. Reed, who came in to this courtroom.  And
10      what did he tell you?
11           "You agree that more likely than not she
12      had some degree of COPD in the late 1980s,
13      correct?"
14           And what was his answer?  "Yes."
15           No hedging.  No fudging.  Yes.
16           The testimony from Dr. Gidel.  He's never
17      seen anyone go from initial symptoms to severe
18      in less than five years.
19           Ms. Wilkinson had COPD.  Don't have to
20      prove that it was diagnosed.  Have to prove
21      that the symptoms first manifested itself.
22           The first hurdle is to prove she had the
23      disease.  We have proven that she had the
24      disease.  We have done it from their own
25      witnesses, from their mouths.  She had the disease.
2           And what do we know from Dr. Gidel?  We
3      know that even patients in the moderate
4      range -- let's go back to that.  Moderate.  Way
5      down the spectrum.  You've got very severe,
6      severe, moderate.
7           Are there patients who have moderate COPD
8      and don't experience symptoms?  And what was
9      his answer?
10           I would say unlikely.
11           Unlikely.  Even patients with moderate
12      COPD, according to their own expert witness in
13      this case, the person who treated
14      Ms. Wilkinson, testified it was unlikely; that
15      somebody with moderate COPD should have at
16      least moderate COPD in the 1980s.
17           She had symptoms when the disease first
18      manifested itself.  Was it before May 5th,
19      1990?  Barbara Walsh's testimony.
20           Dan, can you play that?
21           (Thereupon, a video clip played as
22      follows:)
23           "QUESTION:  Do you recall Ms. Wilkinson
24      ever having any difficulty breathing?
25           "ANSWER:  Yes. "QUESTION:  Do you know approximately when
2      you first observed her having difficulty
3      breathing?
4           "ANSWER:  I would say in the late '70s.
5           "QUESTION:  And how would you describe
6      what you observed about her having difficulty
7      breathing?
8           "ANSWER:  That's air, gasping, short
9      gasps, and she used those little inhalers.
10      They were a small amount, but they were pretty
11      good size.  You pumped them.  I have never used
12      one, so..."
13           (The video clip ended.)
14           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Nobody asked her about the
15      inhalers, and she volunteered it.  She
16      volunteered that:  I saw her having shortness
17      of breath at work, when she was working, and I
18      saw her use the inhalers.
19           She told you that.  No one had to ask her
20      a question about whether she was using
21      inhalers.  That's what Ms. Walsh distinctly
22      remembers.
23           What did Ms. Wilkinson's own brother say
24      about her having symptoms of shortness of
25      breath? Would you play that, Dan?
2 3           "QUESTION:  Did you tell Vivian that
4      cigarettes were causing her shortness of
5      breath?
6           "ANSWER:  Yes.
7           "QUESTION:  Did you tell Vivian that
8      cigarettes were causing her shortness of breath
9      more than once?
10           "ANSWER:  Oh, God, yes.  Oh, yes.
11           "QUESTION:  Did Vivian ever deny that
12      cigarettes were causing her shortness of
13      breath?
14           "ANSWER:  No, she never denied it.
15           "QUESTION:  Did Vivian ever agree with you
16      that cigarettes were causing her shortness of
17      breath?
18           "ANSWER:  She knew it, yes.  I don't know
19      whether she agreed with me or no, but she knew
20      it.
21           "QUESTION:  Did she -- did Vivian
22      verbalize to you that she knew that cigarettes
23      were causing shortness of breath?"
24           (The video clip ended.)
25           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Did she verbalize that she knew that cigarettes were causing her shortness
2      of breath?
3           Yes.
4           And the testimony from Mr. Wicks is that
5      shortness of breath was in her 40s.  In her
6      40s.  Exactly the time period that we are
7      talking about.  She had symptoms.
8           You would have to disbelieve her own
9      brother and you would have to disbelieve
10      someone who worked with her and went to her
11      wedding, her daughter's wedding, about her
12      having her symptoms prior to May 5th, 1990, to
13      find for the Plaintiff in this case.
14           So let me address this point.  She knew or
15      should have known that there was a reasonable
16      possibility that her COPD/emphysema was caused
17      by cigarette smoking.  Okay?
18           Mr. Wicks just told you.  We proved that.
19      She knew her shortness of breath was caused by
20      her smoking.
21           Reasonable possibility that her
22      COPD/emphysema was caused by cigarette smoking.
23      She was short of breath, and by her own words
24      knew that that was because of her smoking.
25           And it wasn't just Joseph Wicks.  It was other family members, according to her brother
2      that saw her have shortness of breath, and told
3      her that smoking caused that shortness of
4      breath.
5           We just heard it from Mr. Wicks, and
6      Mr. Wicks told you in that same testimony that
7      her sister -- two sisters, Kathy and Mary
8      Ellen, also told her that her shortness of
9      breath was caused by smoking.
10           Cigarettes caused it, and I preached that;
11      lay off them, stop it.  From Mr. Wicks' own
12      mouth.
13           So, look, we don't have to prove that she
14      was actually diagnosed.  The critical event is
15      when it first manifested itself.  The
16      overwhelming weight of evidence is that it
17      first manifested itself prior to May 5th, 1990.
18      The overwhelming evidence says that.
19           And we know from her own mouth that she
20      knew that the cause of her shortness of breath
21      was smoking.
22           So let's talk about the top part:  Knew or
23      by the exercise of reasonable care knew,
24      exercise of reasonable care, should have known
25      before May 5th that she had the disease.  All right?  That she had the disease.
2           Let's talk about that.  What did Dr. Gidel
3      tell you?  He told you that he has had patients
4      who self-medicate with over-the-counter
5      bronchodilators when they have COPD.
6           What did Ms. Walsh say?
7           Will you play that, please?
8 9           "QUESTION:  Did Ms. Wilkinson -- did you
10      observe Ms. Wilkinson regularly use an inhaler
11      from the late 1970s until at least through the
12      early 1990s?
13           "ANSWER:  Yes.  Yes.
14           "QUESTION:  You observed her using an
15      inhaler after you became a customer?
16           "ANSWER:  Oh, yes, yes.
17           "QUESTION:  And do you know why
18      Ms. Wilkinson was using the inhaler?
19           "ANSWER:  She told me she had a -- in her
20      words, bronchial condition.
21           "QUESTION:  And did she point to anything
22      or demonstrate anything, what she meant by
23      that?
24           "ANSWER:  No.  I knew, you know, bronchial
25      had something to do with breathing, and I -- you know, that was -- that was her excuse for
2      using the inhalers.
3           "QUESTION:  And you remember her using
4      inhalers?
5           "ANSWER:  Yes.
6           "QUESTION:  And you remember her using
7      inhalers for how long?
8           "ANSWER:  Since the late '70s until, I
9      mean -- I mean, every time -- okay.  I need
10      to -- okay.  Where the cash register is here on
11      the bar --
12           "QUESTION:  Okay.
13           "ANSWER:  -- on a pedestal, cabinet, and
14      there is a space around it, her cigarettes
15      would be in one space, and right next to it
16      would be an inhaler."
17           (The video clip ended.)
18           MR. HOHNBAUM:  She knew and remembered
19      precisely where her friend and co-worker,
20      Ms. Wilkinson, kept her inhaler throughout the
21      '80s.  She kept it right on the cash register,
22      next to her cigarettes.
23           She was using an inhaler, and it was
24      making her feel better, and she knew that the
25      shortness of breath that she was having was caused by smoking.
2           This instruction is very important in
3      determining what she knew or by the exercise of
4      reasonable care should have known.
5           Sorry.  I got turned around.
6           Let's talk about Barbara Walsh.  Mr. Rosen
7      didn't say much about Barbara Walsh.  And there
8      is a tension perhaps in the testimony of
9      Mr. Wilkinson and Ms. Turner on this point,
10      right?
11           They say they did not observe their mom
12      being short of breath before May -- before her
13      hospitalization in April of 1993, right?
14      That's their testimony.  Never short of breath.
15      Never saw her use an inhaler.
16           Then we have the testimony of Ms. Walsh
17      that she did use an inhaler and she was short
18      of breath.
19           And I have a nine-year-old son.  He loves
20      to play --
21           MR. ROSEN:  Objection, move to strike.
22           THE COURT:  Jury, disregard the last
23      comment, please.
24           MR. HOHNBAUM:  -- with jigsaw puzzles,
25      jigsaw puzzles.  The satisfaction of putting that piece of the puzzle together so that it
2      fits.  So that it fits.
3           What do we know about Barbara Walsh?
4           She worked with her, Ms. Wilkinson, for
5      five years, often saw her at Eddie's Place when
6      she was a customer, for 15 years.
7           She received the same information that
8      Ms. Walsh -- Ms. Wilkinson did, right?  They
9      were in the same environment.  Same generation
10      and background.
11           She was friendly with Ms. Wilkinson.  She
12      described her as nice, intelligent.  She said
13      she was a loving mom.  She said Ms. Turner was
14      a loving daughter.
15           She came in and was talking about
16      Ms. Wilkinson in a nice way.  She said she was
17      hard working.  Barbara Walsh has not a single
18      interest in this case.  She has absolutely no
19      reason to come into this case and not tell the
20      truth, which is what she swore to do.
21           Pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.  Putting them
22      together.  Putting them together.
23           How can Ms. Walsh's testimony be true and
24      the testimony of Ms. Turner and Mr. Wilkinson
25      be true?  And the fact of the matter is, it's not hard to see how that can be.
2           We know from the testimony that she was
3      not -- Ms. Wilkinson was not the type to
4      complain about her health.  She was not the
5      type to complain about her health.
6           She didn't discuss medications with her
7      children.  She didn't discuss what she was
8      going through.
9           Vivian Turner didn't know she had been
10      hospitalized.  Didn't know that she had been
11      hospitalized.  That was on the medical record.
12      Her mom made a decision not to share that
13      information with her daughter.
14           Ms. Wilkinson -- Ms. Turner didn't know
15      she was taking an antibiotic.  Remember the
16      doxycycline?
17           "Did you know your mom was on prescription
18      medication prior to April of '93 when she was
19      in the hospital?
20           "No, I didn't know that."
21           They never noticed that she had a health
22      problem before she was hospitalized.
23           And Mr. Wilkinson:  I never talked about
24      the health risks of smoking with her.
25           Ms. Wilkinson hid for her entire life, until the depositions in this case, the fact
2      that she had three other children.
3           Hid from her, Ms. Turner, and
4      Mr. Wilkinson, that she was married before, the
5      name of that person.
6           Think of the energy and the resolve over
7      the course of their entire life never to share
8      anything about that.
9           And ask yourself:  How hard is it to hide
10      an inhaler?  You put it in a pocket.  You do it
11      in the bathroom.  You do it when they're not
12      around.
13           And, of course, when she needed it the
14      most was at work, when she was exerting
15      herself.  That's when she needed to use the
16      inhaler.
17           And who is the best witness?  Who is the
18      one that was around for most at work?  It was
19      Barbara Walsh.
20           We have to look at the undisputed evidence
21      that we all agree to, to know that
22      Ms. Wilkinson was quite good at hiding her
23      physical discomfort.
24           And why do we know that?  In this case,
25      she went in the hospital on April 20th, 1993. According to her children, before that, before
2      that date, she was in excellent health.  I have
3      never seen her short of breath.  She was doing
4      great.
5           In fact, Ms. Turner said it was a
6      traumatic event.  I had no idea.  All of a
7      sudden my mom is in the hospital.  She's in the
8      hospital.
9           But what do we know about the six months
10      leading up to it from Ms. Wilkinson's own
11      mouth?  Her symptoms were getting progressively
12      worse.  She was not doing well.  She was taking
13      an antibiotic.  She was so short of breath and
14      was having such a problem, she went to the
15      emergency room, which she apparently had never
16      done before, and her children, who were around
17      her, at least Ms. Turner, around her on a
18      weekly, a couple-of-times-a-week basis, did not
19      notice a thing.  Did not notice a thing.
20           She didn't want them to know.  That is how
21      Mr. Wilkinson and Ms. Turner are telling you
22      she was in good health.  I never saw her use an
23      inhaler.
24           But Ms. Walsh did.  And we know how
25      successful Ms. Wilkinson was at sharing some parts of her life with her kids and not sharing
2      other parts of her life with her kids.
3           So what did she know before May 5th, 1990?
4      What do we know was on the packs of cigarettes?
5      We know that after 1985, one of the rotating
6      warnings was smoking causes what?  Emphysema.
7           What did she know?  She knew on the packs
8      of cigarettes that smoking causes emphysema,
9      for more than five years before May 5th, 1990.
10           We had this Saturday Evening Post article.
11      Mr. Wicks said that was one of the publications
12      that he saw in her house, the Saturday Evening
13      Post.
14           Emphysema, stalking the susceptible.  And
15      this was the checklist.  Remember we went
16      through this checklist?  Do I smoke?  Am I
17      short of breath?  You should consult a
18      physician.
19           What do we know about her reading?  She
20      read.  She was intelligent.  She kept up with
21      current events.
22           What was she told from the newspapers?
23      Emphysema on the increase.  Quit smoking.
24      Needs treatment.  And the disease that takes
25      your breath away. That was the information she was getting.
2      She was getting it on her pack of cigarettes
3      from 1985 on.  She was getting it from
4      newspapers.  And, of course, she was getting
5      throughout her life that what she was doing was
6      harmful to her.  Was harmful to her.
7           I know that the smoking was causing my
8      shortness of breath.
9           She knew before May 5th, 1990, that she
10      had COPD/emphysema.
11           But, look, even if you determine we
12      haven't proven that she knew that she had it
13      before May 5th, 1990, the next clause, we
14      certainly have proven that:  By the exercise of
15      reasonable care, she should have known this,
16      she should have known.
17           I jumped the gun before.  This is the
18      instruction that I wanted you to see.  Here is
19      what it tells you about the standard of care:
20           In the exercise of reasonable care, you
21      may consider whether she was negligent in
22      failing to learn that she had COPD/emphysema,
23      or that there was a reasonable probability that
24      it was caused by smoking.
25           Negligence is the failure to use reasonable care -- here it is; what I want you
2      to focus on -- which is the care that a
3      reasonably careful person would use under like
4      circumstances.
5           For over a decade, she was self-treating
6      with inhalers that she was getting from
7      emergency medical professionals at the bar that
8      she worked and frequented.  For over a decade,
9      self-treating.  She should have known.
10           By reading the articles, looking at
11      newspapers, by talking to people, by talking to
12      the people in the bar, she should have known.
13           It's a nifty two-step to put up testimony
14      that the tobacco companies were denying it at
15      that point in time.  That's not the question.
16      The question is what she knew or should have
17      known.  What she knew or should have known.
18           And we know what she was experiencing.
19      And what would a reasonable careful person have
20      done sometime in the decade or so that she's
21      using an inhaler to treat the symptoms?  What
22      would a reasonable person do?
23           A reasonable person goes to a doctor.
24      Sometime in there, go to a doctor.  She's using
25      an inhaler.  What do you do?  You go to a doctor.
2           The inhalers, ladies and gentlemen, were
3      working.  Why would she use them?  They were
4      making her feel better.  They were helping her
5      symptoms.
6           Why would you use something over a decade
7      if it wasn't helping you?  That's the
8      recognition:  That I've got a problem; this
9      medication, this prescription medication is
10      helping the problem.  A reasonable person goes
11      and sees a doctor.
12           And what we know from the testimony on the
13      witness stand was that if she had gone to a
14      doctor and said, I smoke, I'm using an inhaler,
15      it is helping me feel better, I'm getting
16      shortness of breath at my work, what would that
17      doctor have done?  He would have done a PFT,
18      and we already know what that PFT would have
19      shown by the testimony of Dr. Reed, Dr. Gidel
20      and Dr. Farber:  It would have shown that, in
21      fact, she had COPD, all well before May 5th,
22      1990.
23           A reasonable person experiencing those
24      symptoms figures out what the problem is, or
25      goes to a doctor and is diagnosed. This was from the opening.  Mr. Rosen did
2      something similar to this about our statute of
3      limitations defense.
4           Remember he had Barbara Walsh on one side
5      and the slide in the closing was checkmarked
6      next to everybody else.
7           But, look, Joseph Wicks, his testimony is
8      spot on.  She had symptoms prior to May 5th,
9      1990.  She knew it was caused by smoking.
10      Joseph Wicks supports the defense's statute of
11      limitations.
12           Dr. Gidel supports the statute of
13      limitations:  Unlikely, very unlikely not to
14      have symptoms, and certainly more likely than
15      not had the disease prior to May 5th, 1990.
16      She supports the defense.
17           Dr. Reed, the same thing:  She had the
18      disease in the '90s.  Symptoms of shortness of
19      breath are clearly related.
20           And the medical records don't refute it.
21      They support it, right?  You can't go from very
22      severe or severe COPD in 1993 overnight.  It
23      takes years to develop.
24           Those medical records of the severity of
25      the disease in '93 and '98 support, and don't refute it, that she had the disease, and it was
2      significant enough to cause symptoms.
3           This is the law.  This is the law to
4      follow in this case.  And the fact is we have
5      proven by the greater weight of the evidence
6      that Ms. Wilkinson knew or in the exercise of
7      reasonable care should have known before
8      May 5th, 1990, that she had COPD/emphysema.
9           Can you flip this on?  Thank you.
10           You've got the verdict form.  You will
11      have the verdict form.  These are the questions
12      that you will have to ask -- you will have to
13      answer, okay?
14           And the second question, that's the one
15      I've been talking about:  Did Vivian Wilkinson
16      know or by the exercise of reasonable care
17      should have known that she had COPD/emphysema,
18      and that there was a reasonable possibility
19      that the COPD/emphysema was caused by cigarette
20      smoke?
21           And the answer is yes.
22           Thank you.
23           Okay.  Let me talk about the first issue
24      on the verdict form: class membership.  The
25      Plaintiff has to prove addiction and addiction causation.
2           Two components to that.  Must prove that
3      she was addicted to nicotine, and even if they
4      prove to your satisfaction by the greater
5      weight of the evidence that she was addicted,
6      they also have to prove that that addiction, as
7      opposed to her decision to keep smoking, was a
8      legal cause of her death from COPD.
9           And, again, this is the Plaintiff's
10      burden.  The only burden of proof we have is on
11      issue two on the verdict form.  This is their
12      burden of proof, and they have to do it like
13      with everything else, like we just marched
14      through with that: with evidence, with facts.
15           Let's talk about addiction.  Did Plaintiff
16      prove that Ms. Wilkinson was medically
17      addicted?
18           Not addicted in the common sense of the
19      word, not addicted in what you might think it
20      means, not addicted in what somebody might
21      think, but what a professional --
22           MR. ROSEN:  Your Honor, I'm going to
23      object.
24           MR. HOHNBAUM:  -- who diagnoses --
25           THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. HOHNBAUM:  -- what a professional --
2           MR. ROSEN:  Move to strike.
3           THE COURT:  I sustained the objection,
4      Counsel.
5           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Did Plaintiff prove that
6      she was medically --
7           MR. ROSEN:  Again, move to strike, your
8      Honor.  It's not the proper standard.
9           THE COURT:  Counsel, go ahead.
10           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Here is what they brought
11      you.  Dr. Drobes.  He has not treated a patient
12      in 13 years.  He's a researcher.  No harm in
13      that.  Noble calling.  Somebody who spends his
14      time doing research.
15           For the last 13 years, he's not treated
16      any patients for any sort of addiction, and he
17      is not, by his own admission, a medical doctor.
18           Dr. Reed, he came in and he told you that
19      Ms. Wilkinson was addicted.
20           But I asked him:  Do you consider yourself
21      to be an expert on addiction?
22           And what was his answer?  No.
23           He was very forthright about that.  And,
24      of course, he wasn't -- he's not a
25      psychiatrist, hasn't been trained.  And, of course, by the time she got to Dr. Reed, what
2      did his notes say?  She had already quit.  So,
3      of course, he didn't treat her because she had
4      already quit smoking.
5           And Dr. Cummings, who, in fact, does see
6      patients, has seen patients, written
7      stop-smoking guides, did Dr. Cummings, with
8      that level of expertise, "world-renowned" I
9      think is the word we heard, did he give an
10      opinion about whether or not Ms. Wilkinson was
11      addicted?  No, he didn't.  He didn't have any
12      information about her.
13           This is one of the tests that Dr. Drobes
14      used with you: the Fagerstrom test.  This test,
15      as Dr. Barnett said, is not used to diagnose
16      people with nicotine addiction.
17           In fact, it assumes that whoever is taking
18      the test is addicted, and at the bottom it
19      says:  How addicted are you?  Very low level to
20      very high level.
21           And there are questions on there that he
22      answered -- this is one of those points where I
23      asked him -- Mr. Keehfus asked him that first
24      question:  How soon after you get up do you
25      start smoking? That is one of those questions you are not
2      sure how that fits in.
3           And he said:  Well, she does it within the
4      first five minutes.
5           But then when you drill down on that, the
6      fact of the matter is no one knows -- no one
7      testified to how soon she smoked when she got
8      up.  And so he's crediting that she smoked
9      within the five minutes without any testimony.
10           And why, if all you need to establish is
11      that somebody smoked a pack a day for a year,
12      five years, 10 years, 40 years, if all you need
13      is quantity, why did it take him going through
14      this test, why did it take him hours to talk
15      about it?  Because more is required than just
16      quantity.  More is required than that.
17           Dr. Barnett, the only psychiatrist to
18      diagnose Ms. -- to assess Ms. Wilkinson for
19      nicotine addiction.  The only psychiatrist.
20           Like Dr. Drobes, she applied what?  The
21      American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and
22      Statistical Manual No. 5, put out by
23      psychiatrists, used by psychiatrists.
24      Dr. Drobes is not a psychiatrist.
25           And she went through the criteria for you, and she said she was not addicted to the
2      nicotine in cigarettes.
3           She also said that half of all daily
4      smokers are not addicted.  Half are, half
5      aren't.
6           People who smoke -- a quantity -- if it
7      just was, you have to smoke a pack a day for a
8      certain number of years, check, that would be a
9      pretty simple exercise.  And it is not simple.
10      It requires clinical judgment, is what
11      Dr. Barnett told you.  And it is what
12      Dr. Drobes told you.
13           It takes clinical judgment to determine
14      whether or not someone meets the criteria under
15      the DSM-IV.
16           And, of course, we know that people smoke
17      for reasons other than addiction.  We know that
18      people smoke for reasons other than nicotine.
19      Dr. Barnett listed those.  People enjoy the
20      smell, enjoy the taste, they enjoy the ritual.
21      It is satisfying to them.
22           And we know that Ms. Wilkinson smoked.
23      Witnesses on the stand and through the videos
24      said she enjoyed smoking.  She smoked for
25      social reasons.  She liked going to the bar. She went to the bar that she worked at, where
2      95 percent of the customers smoked, even when
3      she wasn't working there.  She liked -- she
4      liked to smoke.  She liked to socialize with
5      people at the bar.
6           And she never told anyone that he was
7      addicted.  She never said, I'm addicted.
8           Ms. Wilkinson was not addicted.  That is
9      the reason to answer that question "no."
10           But even if you find that she was
11      addicted, that is not the end of the analysis,
12      because the instruction couldn't be clearer
13      that you have to prove that the addiction --
14      that but for an addiction to cigarettes
15      containing nicotine, the COPD/emphysema would
16      not have occurred.  It is not enough just to
17      establish that she was addicted.
18           And this is a helpful way to look at it:
19      Did she have the ability to quit and chose to
20      continue smoking, or was she compelled to
21      smoke, leaving her no choice and becoming just
22      sort of a robot that had to have the next
23      cigarette.
24           And here is what we know from the
25      witnesses:  Addiction does not prevent smokers from quitting.  Addicted smokers can and do
2      quit.  Any smoker, any smoker can quit.
3           Of course, we know she never tried to quit
4      while she was smoking RJ Reynolds cigarettes.
5           The first evidence that we have in this
6      case that she started -- that she tried to quit
7      was in the late '70s.
8           Millions and millions and millions and
9      millions of people have quit smoking.  Heavily
10      addicted smokers quit smoking.  You can quit
11      smoking.  She could quit smoking.
12           Look, were the cigarettes she was smoking
13      different than the cigarette that was smoked by
14      the 60 million people who quit?  Of course it
15      wasn't.  Did if affect her brain differently?
16      Were they exposed to advertising any
17      differently?  Did she smoke longer?  No.
18           Was she different from her brother, who we
19      know chose to quit, and quit?  Of course not.
20           She made the choice to continue to smoke.
21           What do we know about her?  What do we
22      know about this woman?  We know she was
23      strong-willed, hard to move off an idea,
24      intelligent, independent.  She did what she
25      wanted to do. This is what I was going to do.  That's
2      the type of woman that she was.  If she set her
3      mind to quit, she would have quit.
4           Of course, we know at some point in time
5      she did have some problem with alcohol.  It
6      ruined her first marriage.  She conquered that,
7      managed that.  She was able to work through
8      that and successfully deal with it.
9           What do we know, Keith Malloy never saw
10      her try to quit.  Vivian Turner never saw until
11      early -- try to quit in the '60s.
12           Ms. Walsh, her contemporary, Ms. Walsh
13      never, in the '70s, '80s or '90s, the person
14      she came back to the bar with and hung out
15      with, the patron at the bar, never tried to
16      quit, never talked about quitting, never said
17      it was hard, never saw her try to quit.
18           Of course, what do the medical records
19      say?  She did quit.  She quit starting at least
20      by April/May of 1998.  She did stop.
21           Dr. Reed, I went through the whole
22      exercise with him:  "Are those records accurate
23      that she quit?"
24           What did he say?  "Yes."
25           And every record after that said that she quit.
2           If somebody comes into the emergency room,
3      that they have been smoking, do people know
4      that they are smoking?  Can they smell it?  Of
5      course they can smell it.  He said:  My records
6      are accurate.  She quit.
7           The first issue on the verdict form:  Was
8      she addicted?  And even if so, was the
9      addiction the legal cause of her chronic
10      obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema?  The
11      answer to that question is "no."
12           It is "no" on addicted, and "no" on
13      addiction causation.
14           Can you go back, please?
15           The last question I'm going to address,
16      and then I'm going to turn it over to
17      Mr. Keehfus, the third issue on the verdict
18      form:  Was smoking cigarettes manufactured by
19      RJ Reynolds a legal cause of her COPD/emphysema
20      and death?  There is only one Defendant in this
21      case:  It is RJ Reynolds.
22           This is the instruction.  Like with all of
23      this, that is your guide.  That is the law of
24      the case that you have been instructed by the
25      Judge you must follow and that you have agreed to follow.  The COPD must be caused by
2      Reynolds' products.
3           There is no evidence that she was ever
4      impacted by advertising.  Did you ever see --
5      you heard a part on that by Philip Morris, but
6      not by RJ Reynolds.
7           Never heard a statement by anyone at RJ
8      Reynolds.  No evidence that she started smoking
9      a Reynolds product when she started smoking.
10      No evidence that she smoked a light cigarette
11      manufactured by RJ Reynolds, or a low-tar
12      cigarette.
13           She smoked Parliament for more than
14      20 years, from 1975 until 1998.  The only light
15      cigarette -- you heard testimony about
16      lights -- was Parliament light.  And how long
17      did she smoke it?  Intermittently, on and off
18      for a year.
19           We talked about this in openings.  Is it
20      seven years?  Is it six years?  Is it 10 years?
21      It's in that ballpark, ladies and gentlemen of
22      the jury.
23           And we know that smoking cigarettes for
24      seven years, eight years, nine years, 10 years,
25      is not enough.  It is not sufficient to cause COPD.  Not likely to cause it.
2           And you heard from Dr. Farber that she
3      would have developed COPD/emphysema anyway,
4      because you take that time period out, the six
5      years, is it five years, is it 10 years, you
6      take that time period out, and she still would
7      have gotten COPD/emphysema.  Of course she
8      would have.  She smoked for 50 years.
9           Was smoking cigarettes manufactured by RJ
10      Reynolds Tobacco Company a legal cause of
11      Ms. Wilkinson's COPD/emphysema and death?
12           The answer to that question is "no."
13           Thank you again for your service, and I'm
14      going to turn it over to Mr. Keehfus.  Thank
15      you.


21           MR. KEEHFUS:  May it please the Court.
22           Good afternoon, Ms. Turner, Counsel.
23           Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
24           JURORS:  Good afternoon.
25           MR. KEEHFUS:  I have the pleasure today to discuss with you the remaining questions on the
2      verdict form, the questions that you are going
3      to decide in this case.  And those will be
4      questions 4 through question 8.
5           Now, you shouldn't get this far, because
6      as Mr. Hohnbaum explained, the evidence
7      demonstrates that you should return a defense
8      verdict on the issue of statute of limitations,
9      question 2.
10           And further as Mr. Hohnbaum described to
11      you, there has been a failure of proof, a
12      complete failure of proof on the Plaintiff's
13      part that Ms. Wilkinson was a class member.
14           But I have an obligation to discuss all of
15      the issues in the case.  So in the event that
16      you do get this far, I'm going to discuss with
17      you why there has been a complete failure of
18      proof on the rest of Plaintiff's claims.
19           I'm going to start with questions 4 and 5
20      because they go together.  And those are
21      Plaintiff's claims of concealment and agreement
22      to conceal.
23           And, ladies and gentlemen, you heard Judge
24      Murphy read the instructions to you this
25      morning.  Those instructions in this case are critical.  No matter what it is in our lives,
2      whether it is putting together Legos, whether
3      it's fixing your toilet at the house, whether
4      it's putting in a new flood light, the
5      instructions tell you everything that you need
6      to know.
7           And this case is no different.  The legal
8      instructions that the Judge has read to you
9      tell you everything you need to know to answer
10      the claims in this case.
11           Those are the legal principles and the
12      legal rules that you have to apply to the facts
13      that you have been presented to render your
14      verdict, the facts that you have been
15      presented, not argument.  As the Judge
16      instructed you, lawyer argument isn't evidence.
17      Rhetoric, catch phrases aren't evidence.  You
18      need proof.  You need facts to apply.
19           For example, a lawyer saying that
20      Ms. Wilkinson relied on concealment and that
21      reliance was a legal cause of her
22      COPD/emphysema is not evidence.  That's not
23      facts.  That's an argument.
24           So we're going to look at the facts,
25      because the instructions are critical.  And because the instructions tell you what you need
2      to know to answer these claims, I want to take
3      a look at those.
4           This is instruction No. 15 in your
5      booklet.  Number 15.  And instruction 15 and
6      instruction 16 go together.  They deal with
7      those questions, No. 4 and No. 5, on
8      concealment and agreement to conceal.
9           And what I would like to do is highlight
10      three very important parts of instruction
11      No. 15 for you.  Again, these are the rules
12      that will guide you in your determination.
13           And what you were instructed on
14      Plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment is
15      that the issue for your determination is
16      whether Vivian Wilkinson reasonably relied to
17      her detriment on any statement of material fact
18      by RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company that concealed
19      or omitted material information not otherwise
20      known or available, not otherwise known or
21      available, concerning the health effects or
22      addictive nature of smoking cigarettes.
23           That is the first critical part of the
24      instruction.
25           The second part, we are going to focus on as we go along is that of material facts.  We
2      know that the Plaintiffs have to prove a
3      material fact, that something that was
4      concealed was material.  It was a game-changer.
5           What does that mean?  A material fact, as
6      you were instructed, is one that is of such
7      importance that Ms. Wilkinson would not have
8      acted as she did but for the concealment or
9      omission of that fact.  It is one -- it is one
10      of such importance that she would not have
11      acted as she did.
12           That is Plaintiff's burden, to prove to
13      you with evidence that but for concealment of
14      some fact, Ms. Wilkinson would not have acted
15      as she did, she wouldn't have continued to
16      smoke.  If she had known that material fact,
17      she would have changed her behavior by quitting
18      smoking.
19           That is the inquiry when you get to
20      question 4:  Did the Plaintiff prove to you
21      with evidence that Ms. Wilkinson would have
22      changed her behavior had she known something
23      else.
24           They did not.  There is a complete failure
25      of proof on that point.  And we will discuss that.
2           The third section I would like to
3      highlight of this instruction is critical.
4      Ms. Wilkinson cannot be found to have
5      reasonably relied on a statement if she knew it
6      was false or its falsity was obvious to her, or
7      if the fact allegedly concealed was already
8      known to her.  She cannot be found to have
9      relied, if that fact, allegedly concealed -- if
10      she already knew it.
11           So those are the three critical parts of
12      this instruction that we need to keep in mind
13      as we go through the verdict form.
14           And the Plaintiffs very simply have failed
15      to prove concealment.  They failed to prove
16      that Ms. Wilkinson relied on some tobacco
17      industry statement that concealed or omitted
18      information that she didn't already know.
19           They have to prove this connection, this
20      link between statements the tobacco industry
21      made and Ms. Wilkinson's conduct and
22      Ms. Wilkinson's injuries.
23           And they failed to do that.  There is zero
24      evidence in this case.  Again, the instructions
25      are important, because they tell you, you cannot conceal what someone already knows.  And
2      that makes perfect sense.  You can't take that
3      knowledge away from someone after she knows it.
4           You can't conceal something from someone
5      who already knows that fact from another
6      source.  You can't hide something in plain
7      sight.
8           Plaintiff has to prove that a statement
9      made by RJ Reynolds reached Ms. Wilkinson and
10      it impacted her in a material way, in order to
11      succeed on this claim.
12           They failed to do that.  Why did they fail
13      to do that?  We know.  We know from your
14      instruction, she can't rely on a statement if
15      the fact that was allegedly concealed was
16      already known to her.
17           As Mr. Hohnbaum briefly explained earlier
18      this afternoon, and I'm going to go into more
19      detail, Ms. Wilkinson was warned about and knew
20      the dangers of smoking her entire life.  That
21      information was known and available to her
22      throughout her life.
23           What was the evidence on that?  In
24      summary, Ms. Wilkinson knew that smoking was
25      dangerous in the 1940s.  She knew that smoking could kill her in the 1940s.  And she never
2      disputed that smoking was dangerous and
3      addictive; not once throughout her entire life.
4           You cannot conceal something from -- you
5      cannot conceal from someone when she already
6      knows it, and Ms. Wilkinson knew it.
7           You heard several times in this case about
8      doubt, confusion.  There was no doubt and no
9      confusion.  There was no evidence that
10      Ms. Wilkinson ever expressed doubt or confusion
11      about the dangers of smoking.
12           Instead, she verbalized to those around
13      her that she understood those dangers.
14           Ladies and gentlemen, if there is one fact
15      in this case that is beyond dispute,
16      Ms. Wilkinson understood the dangers of smoking
17      since the time she started smoking.
18           How do we know that?  Well, we have the
19      testimony from her brother Joseph Wicks.
20 21           "QUESTION:  When you were growing up, did
22      your parents allow you to smoke in the house?
23           "ANSWER:  No, I never smoked.  My daddy
24      wouldn't allow that, period.
25           "QUESTION:  What did your dad say to you about smoking when you were growing up?
2           "ANSWER:  I can remember, when he caught
3      me and my brother sneaking his cigarettes, and
4      he made us set down and smoke a pack, and we
5      almost died.  I do remember that.
6           "QUESTION:  Did he say anything to you
7      when he caught you smoking?
8           "ANSWER:  Yes.  You know, he was always
9      against that.  Bad health, you know, ruin your
10      health, ruin your life.
11           "QUESTION:  Did your father tell you that
12      cigarettes were bad for your health?
13           "ANSWER:  Yes.
14           "QUESTION:  Did your father tell you that
15      cigarettes would ruin your life?
16           "ANSWER:  Yes.
17           "QUESTION:  Did he tell you those things
18      more than once when you were growing up?
19           "ANSWER:  Lots of times.  Lots of times.
20           "QUESTION:  Were you the only sibling that
21      your father told those things to?
22           "ANSWER:  No.  My brother, too.  I'm
23      pretty sure he lectured my sisters, too.
24           "QUESTION:  Your father was an equal
25      opportunity lecturer on the subject? "ANSWER:  Yes
2           "QUESTION:  Do you think that your father
3      told you that cigarettes were bad for your
4      health more than 10 times when you were growing
5      up?

11      tell you that cigarettes were bad for your
12      health after you were an adult?

14      back from World War II, I went to meet my dad."
15           (The video clip ended.)
16           MR. KEEHFUS:  Ladies and gentlemen, this
17      was the environment that Ms. Wilkinson grew up
18      in, the environment where her parents didn't
19      allow smoking; where her father was such a
20      staunch antismoking advocate when he discovered
21      her brothers smoking that he sat them down and
22      made them smoke an entire pack of cigarettes.
23      And you heard how Mr. Wicks reacted to that.
24           You heard a lot about the culture back
25      then, how things were different. In Ms. Wilkinson's home, that was the
2      culture; the culture of smoking being
3      prohibited, and her father telling her and her
4      siblings that smoking would ruin your life.
5           That was the culture.  That was the
6      environment Ms. Wilkinson grew up in.  That was
7      the information known to her.
8           As Mr. Hohnbaum told you the evidence is
9      overwhelming that Ms. Wilkinson lived in a
10      world of warnings, surrounded by warnings from
11      every source: family, friends, pop culture,
12      slang, her sister, her own body.
13           Ms. Wilkinson knew.  She knew smoking was
14      dangerous.  And she knew it for 50 years.
15           That is the information that Ms. Wilkinson
16      knew.  She cannot be found to have reasonably
17      relied on a statement if the fact allegedly
18      concealed was already known to her.
19           You heard the testimony of Ms. Walsh.  I
20      don't think we need to play it again.  But you
21      heard the testimony of Ms. Walsh that their
22      boss, Wanda Sarussi, at Eddie's Place, sat them
23      down and had a very frank and candid
24      conversation with them about the dangers of
25      smoking. You will recall Ms. Walsh testified that
2      Ms. Sarussi had quit smoking.  She talked to
3      both of them, Ms. Walsh and Ms. Wilkinson,
4      together.  And she said:  Quit smoking.
5           What else did she say?  A familiar refrain
6      in Ms. Wilkinson's life.  Ms. Sarussi told her:
7      Smoking will ruin her life, just like her
8      father has told her, just like Joseph Wicks had
9      told her.
10           Ms. Sarussi just confirmed what
11      Ms. Wilkinson already knew:  Smoking was
12      dangerous, and it would ruin her life.  And she
13      chose to continue smoking.
14           And Ms. Walsh was right there for the
15      conversation.  She was able to observe
16      Ms. Wilkinson's reactions.  And what did she
17      testify to?  I'm sure she knew.
18           Of course she knew.  The evidence is
19      overwhelming that she knew, and there's been no
20      attempt to say that Ms. Wilkinson didn't know
21      the dangers of smoking.
22           It wasn't simply in Ms. Wilkinson's home.
23      The dangerous and addictive nature of
24      cigarettes has been public knowledge for more
25      than 100 years.  That is what Dr. Cummings told you on cross-examination.
2           Now a word about Dr. Cummings.  He's the
3      witness the Plaintiffs -- the first live
4      witness the Plaintiff's brought; and as you
5      heard, he's the witness that travels from
6      courtroom to courtroom testifying against
7      tobacco companies.  He's testified in over 80
8      trials against tobacco companies.  And he's
9      been doing it for 20 years.
10           And this is what he conceded on
11      cross-examination.  Now, it wasn't always easy.
12      Mr. Hohnbaum, over 20 times, had to show him
13      his prior sworn testimony, but this is what he
14      conceded:
15           For over 100 years, the public has known
16      nicotine occurs naturally in tobacco; that it
17      can be difficult to quit smoking; smoking is
18      dangerous and addictive; and tobacco use can
19      cause cancer.
20           Remember, the Plaintiff has to prove
21      reliance on a statement that concealed
22      information not otherwise known or available.
23           This was known and available for over 100
24      years.
25           What else did Dr. Cummings tell you?  By 1954, virtually everyone knew that smoking
2      caused disease.
3           And we know in this case, Ms. Wilkinson
4      knew 10 years prior to that, when she was
5      growing up in the 1940s.  That was the
6      testimony that you just heard from Mr. Wicks.
7           Mr. Wicks told you when he came back from
8      the war, he started warning her that smoking
9      would kill her.  Ten years prior to 1954.
10           Now in 1954, Ms. Wilkinson was 21 years
11      old.  She had three children and was married.
12      She was an adult.
13           Dr. Cummings told you that this conspiracy
14      to conceal started in December of 1953; and
15      then in cross-examination, conceded that by
16      1954, virtually everyone knew smoking could
17      cause disease.
18           Known and available.  The public had been
19      extensively warned prior to 1964.
20           Dr. Leroy Burney, the Surgeon General at
21      the time, in the moment, in real time, in 1957,
22      Dr. Burney said:  The message is getting out.
23      We have informed the public.
24           Dr. Heller, the National Cancer Institute,
25      similar.  Boots on the ground.  In 1957, not looking back 40 years, he was there in real
2      time:  Excellent job covering the problem, and
3      a very objective job, a valuable way of
4      informing the public.  The message was out
5      there.
6           This information was known and available.
7           What were smokers doing with that
8      information?  Well, we know millions of highly
9      addicted smokers quit before Ms. Wilkinson ever
10      smoked an RJ Reynolds cigarette.
11           You can see on this timeline.  Between
12      1950 and 1965, over 17 million people quit.
13      Between 1964 and 1979, 30 million people in
14      that 15 years quit; two million people every
15      year.
16           The information was out there, and people
17      were making a decision to quit.
18           Now, there was some discussion in this
19      case about the warning labels that went on in
20      1966.  You may recall Dr. Cummings' testimony
21      about what little effect they had.
22           But on cross-examination, he conceded that
23      between 1966 and 1970, 13 million people quit
24      in those four years.  In those four years,
25      after that warning label on went on, 13 million people quit.
2           What did Dr. Cummings say?  That was the
3      largest four-year decline in American history.
4           The message was out there; the information
5      about the dangers of smoking was known; it was
6      available to Ms. Wilkinson; and it was getting
7      through to people.
8           Dr. Cummings conceded that virtually
9      everyone had heard about the 1964 Surgeon
10      General's Report at that time.
11           How do we know that?  Well, the evidence
12      was it was major news across the country, and
13      in Florida.  You may recall that map of Florida
14      that showed the newspaper articles north to
15      south, from Tallahassee to Miami, and east to
16      west.
17           Every major newspaper in Florida covered
18      the story above the fold, front page,
19      publicizing the conclusions of the 1964 Surgeon
20      General's Report that smoking was a cause of
21      cancer.
22           The information was known, and it was
23      available.
24           And we know that Ms. Wilkinson heard about
25      the 1964 Surgeon General's Report because her brother told her about it.
2           He learned about it in 1964, and he told
3      his entire family, including Ms. Wilkinson,
4      about the Surgeon General's Report.
5           You cannot conceal something from someone
6      when they already know.  That is the
7      instruction you have been given.
8           There's warnings by the public health
9      community.  Dr. Daniel Horn, in 1968, he was
10      one of the famous researchers that you heard
11      about that worked with the American Cancer
12      Society, one of the leading experts on the
13      dangers of smoking in the 1950s, '60s and '70s.
14           This is what he said:  You can stand on a
15      rooftop and shout "smoking is dangerous" at the
16      top of your lungs.  You would not be telling
17      anyone anything that they did not already know.
18           No one needed to stand on a rooftop at
19      Ms. Wilkinson's house because she already knew
20      it.  By 1968, she had known for over 20 years
21      that smoking was dangerous.
22           We know the warning labels were on
23      cigarettes.  Every pack of Reynolds'
24      cigarettes, anyone who saw Ms. Wilkinson smoke,
25      carried a federally mandated warning label. There is no dispute that Ms. Wilkinson saw
2      those warning labels at least 20 times a day.
3      She picked up that pack of cigarettes 20 times
4      a day.  Can there be any dispute that she saw
5      that warning label?  She continued to smoke.
6      And that was her choice.
7           The Court instructed you regarding the
8      warning labels that after July 1, 1969, those
9      warning labels are adequate as a matter of law
10      and cannot be challenged.
11           The only advertisement that any witness
12      recalled Ms. Wilkinson seeing was after 1969.
13           Why is that important?  Because after
14      1969, every cigarette advertisement -- I'm
15      sorry, after 1971, every cigarette
16      advertisement had a warning label.  Every one,
17      including the Parliament ad.  The one
18      Parliament ad you heard about carried a Surgeon
19      General's warning label, saying that the
20      Surgeon General has determined that cigarette
21      smoking is dangerous to your health.
22           The information was known and it was
23      available.
24           Let's talk about advertising for a minute,
25      because you some saw evidence about that. What didn't you see?  Well, there was no
2      evidence that advertising caused Ms. Wilkinson
3      to begin smoking.
4           There was no evidence, there were no facts
5      presented to you that advertising caused
6      Ms. Wilkinson to begin smoking.
7           As Mr. Hohnbaum pointed out earlier, no
8      one knows why Ms. Wilkinson began smoking.  But
9      there is certainly no evidence that advertising
10      caused her to start smoking.
11           No witness mentioned that Ms. Wilkinson
12      saw any Reynolds advertisement.  We know that
13      cigarette advertising was legal.  And you have
14      an instruction in your booklet that says that:
15      The manufacture, sale and advertising of
16      cigarettes is legal.  That is an issue that our
17      Congress has decided.
18           And we know that all advertising had
19      warnings starting in the early 1970s, years
20      before Ms. Wilkinson tried to quit.
21           Now, let's talk about this one Parliament
22      advertisement that Mr. Wilkinson recalled at
23      the beauty parlor.  That was the only evidence
24      you heard about Ms. Wilkinson seeing an
25      advertisement in this case. And the testimony was that she saw this
2      advertisement sometime in the 1970s, 30 years
3      after she had been warned.  She had received 30
4      consecutive years of warnings about the dangers
5      of smoking before there is any evidence that
6      she saw the cigarette advertisement.
7           By the time she saw this advertisement in
8      the 1970s, her brother had been warning her;
9      she had heard about the 1964 Surgeon General's
10      Report; she knew that smoking was dangerous.
11           And there is no evidence that that
12      advertisement had any impact on her whatsoever.
13      There is no evidence that that advertisement
14      was material in her decision to continue
15      smoking.
16           There is no evidence that Ms. Wilkinson
17      was going to stop smoking if she hadn't seen
18      that one Parliament advertisement issued by
19      Philip Morris, who is not a Defendant in this
20      case.
21           You heard Dr. Cummings testify that
22      cigarette advertising was wallpaper.  Well,
23      Dr. Cummings was never in Ms. Wilkinson's home,
24      because we know that wallpaper was not in her
25      house.  Instead, she was surrounded by warnings.  She was surrounded by personalized,
2      direct and candid warnings from her family and
3      friends throughout her entire life.
4           There was discussion about filters and
5      lights, and it was suggested to you that
6      Ms. Wilkinson smoked filtered cigarettes
7      because she thought they were safer.
8           You will recall that testimony.  The only
9      time that testimony was mentioned was during
10      the cross-examination of Dr. Barnett.
11           At no other time.  Ms. Turner didn't tell
12      you that Ms. Wilkinson smoked filtered
13      cigarettes because she thought they were safer.
14           Mr. Wilkinson didn't tell you that
15      Ms. Wilkinson --
16           MR. ROSEN:  Your Honor, I object.
17           THE COURT:  What is the objection?
18           MR. ROSEN:  I was precluded from asking
19      the question.  Hearsay.
20           THE COURT:  Sustained.  Rephrase, Counsel.
21           MR. KEEHFUS:  Certainly.
22           Ladies and gentlemen, the only time you
23      heard that evidence was on the
24      cross-examination of Dr. Barnett.  There was no
25      specific evidence on that point. What do we know about the generic filters
2      and lights case that you heard?
3           We know that Ms. Wilkinson smoked light
4      cigarettes for less than a year in the late
5      1980s.  Less than a year.
6           And we know that the evidence is that when
7      she did smoke lights, she switched back and
8      forth between lights and regular full-flavored
9      cigarettes.
10           Is someone who is switching to light
11      cigarettes because she thinks they are safer
12      then going to go and switch back to
13      full-flavored cigarettes?  That doesn't make
14      any sense.
15           Less than a year in the late 1980s, those
16      filtered and light cigarettes carried the exact
17      same warning label as every other cigarette.
18           During this one year in the late 1980s,
19      Plaintiff claims that Ms. Wilkinson was still
20      trying to quit.
21           Why is she trying to quit if she thinks
22      that light cigarettes are safer?  She didn't
23      think that.  She was smoking light cigarettes
24      because she liked light cigarettes.  And then
25      she went back to her regular brand. The only brand of light cigarettes
2      Ms. Wilkinson smoked was Parliament light, not
3      a product made by RJ Reynolds.
4           And we know from Dr. Cummings'
5      cross-examination, the public health community,
6      during Ms. Wilkinson's life, concluded that
7      filtered and lower tar cigarettes were safer,
8      and they encouraged people to quit smoking or
9      switch to them.  That was the message coming
10      from the public health community in the 1970s
11      and the 1980s.
12           Plaintiff's generic evidence on filters
13      and lights has nothing to do with this case.
14      Ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you, it does
15      not help you answer a single question on your
16      verdict form.
17           This is all of the evidence you heard from
18      Dr. Cummings, a day and a half of statements,
19      press releases, video clips.  Not a single
20      shred of evidence that Ms. Wilkinson saw or was
21      impacted by it at all.
22           Remember, in your concealment instruction,
23      she has to have relied on a statement that
24      concealed a material fact, something that would
25      have impacted her, it would have changed her; that she had seen it, she would have changed
2      her behavior.  There is simply no evidence of
3      that.
4           We asked Ms. Turner and Mr. Wilkinson on
5      the stand -- you may have wondered why, why
6      would we ask about statements by the Tobacco
7      Research Committee or the Council for Tobacco
8      Research.
9           We asked both of them:  Did your mother
10      ever discuss with you any statements made by
11      any of these entities?  And the answer was "no"
12      every single time.
13           That is the evidence that you have in the
14      record before you.  That is the evidence that
15      you have to apply to the law that the Judge has
16      instructed you on.
17           This is, again, a material fact
18      instruction.  This is your guide.  This is your
19      instruction book that will help you navigate
20      through the verdict form.
21           And you see there the material fact
22      instruction:  Would not have acted as she did
23      if not for the statement concealed.
24           They haven't proven a statement that she
25      saw or was impacted by; and they have not proven that she would not have acted as she did
2      but for that statement.
3           Now, on this issue of material
4      information, what we do know is, we do have
5      evidence of how Ms. Wilkinson did respond when
6      she was given warnings.  We know how she
7      reacted when people warned her about the
8      dangers of smoking.
9           What was the evidence?  When Ms. Sarussi
10      told her you need to quit smoking, it's going
11      to ruin your life, Ms. Walsh told you she
12      fluffed it off.
13           She didn't at that point try and change
14      her behavior.  She didn't at that point say,
15      You know what, I'm going to try to quit.
16      Instead, she fluffed it off.
17           Barbara Walsh told you it didn't matter,
18      it didn't matter, she was going to do what she
19      wanted to do.  And she did it willingly,
20      willfully and enjoyably.
21           Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Wilkinson did
22      not develop COPD/emphysema because the health
23      effects or addictive nature of cigarettes were
24      unknown or unavailable to her.
25           The evidence is relentless.  It is consistent and continuous.  Ms. Wilkinson knew
2      the dangers of smoking.  That information was
3      available to her, surrounded her, her entire
4      life.  And you cannot conceal something from
5      somebody that they already know.
6           Ms. Wilkinson knew that cigarettes could
7      kill her.  What more did she need to know?
8      Those stark warnings she got in the 1940s,
9      cigarettes can kill you, she knew it.
10           Was there any evidence in this case, any
11      evidence whatsoever that she needed to know
12      that there was ammonia in cigarettes and that
13      would have been the game-changer for her?
14      There is no evidence of that.
15           Was there any evidence in this case that
16      she needed to know that flue-cured tobacco was
17      in cigarettes and, you know, that was going to
18      be the material fact that made her quit
19      smoking?
20           MR. ROSEN:  Your Honor, I again object to
21      this.
22           THE COURT:  Sustained.
23           MR. HOHNBAUM:  There is no evidence in
24      this case that Ms. Wilkinson was waiting on
25      tobacco company -- MR. ROSEN:  Objection, your Honor.
2           THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, rely on
3      your own recollection of the evidence.
4           Proceed, Counsel.
5           MR. KEEHFUS:  Ms. Wilkinson had that
6      information.  She had the information about the
7      dangers of smoking.  What more did she need to
8      know?  There has been a complete failure of
9      proof to you on that.
10           The evidence is overwhelming that
11      Ms. Wilkinson knew the health effects and
12      addictive nature.  You cannot conceal what she
13      already knew.
14           For those reasons, ladies and gentlemen,
15      remember, questions 4 and 5, there is similar
16      analysis for both on the question of
17      concealment, reliance on concealment, and the
18      same question on reliance on agreement to
19      conceal.  The same analysis, the same answer.
20           And when you get to those questions, we
21      submit to you that your answer should be "no."
22           Okay.  Question 6.  Again, I submit to you
23      that you should not get this far, but if you
24      do, I would like to discuss with you the
25      evidence and how it fits into the instructions that you have been given.
2           And this is the question of fault that you
3      assign that was a legal cause of
4      Ms. Wilkinson's injuries.  A legal cause of her
5      injuries.
6           The assignment of fault relates only to
7      those actions that were a legal cause of
8      Ms. Wilkinson's emphysema and death.  The
9      assignment of fault can only be related to the
10      conduct the Plaintiff linked up or connected to
11      Ms. Wilkinson specifically with facts.
12           Now, Dr. Cummings showed you some stuff;
13      some wrong stuff, some bad stuff.  But that is
14      not the issue before you.  The issue before you
15      is what kind or actions were a legal cause of
16      Ms. Wilkinson's injuries.
17           Stated a different way, Reynolds cannot be
18      assigned fault for actions that were not a
19      legal cause of Ms. Wilkinson's COPD/emphysema
20      or death.
21           And the Engle findings don't establish
22      that Reynolds is at fault for Ms. Wilkinson's
23      COPD or death.  It is not a comparison of
24      choices; it is not a comparison of whose
25      choices are worse. The assignment of fault relates only to
2      that specific conduct that you find was a legal
3      cause of Ms. Wilkinson's injuries.
4           Now, it was suggested to you earlier this
5      morning that perhaps Ms. Wilkinson had as
6      little as 10 percent fault.  10 percent fault.
7           But the evidence demonstrates that
8      Ms. Wilkinson was the only cause of her
9      COPD/emphysema.  Ms. Wilkinson chose to smoke
10      for decades without making a serious quit
11      attempt.  Decades.
12           She was not confused about the dangers and
13      addictive nature of smoking.  She knew that
14      information her entire life.  Every smoker has
15      the ability to quit, including Ms. Wilkinson.
16           And Ms. Wilkinson had the responsibility
17      to quit smoking if she wanted to do that.
18           THE COURT:  Five minutes, Counsel.
19           MR. KEEHFUS:  Ms. Wilkinson could have
20      quit smoking at a time that prevented her
21      death.
22           As Dr. Cummings told you, a smoker is
23      fully responsible for making the choice to
24      quit.
25           And, ladies and gentlemen, when you get this question on the verdict form, I submit to
2      you, state the percentage of any fault that was
3      a legal cause, that Ms. Wilkinson's actions
4      were the only legal cause of her
5      COPD/emphysema.
6           You heard Plaintiff's claim for damages.
7      Plaintiffs asked for $2 million in damages
8      each.  You will be instructed that any damages
9      must be just in light of the evidence, and
10      Plaintiff has the burden to prove every dollar.
11           Plaintiff is not seeking damages for
12      Ms. Wilkinson's four other children, her pain
13      and suffering, loss of wages, funeral expenses,
14      her support and services.
15           The Plaintiff failed to prove that
16      Ms. Turner and Ms. Wilkinson are entitled to
17      $4 million because their mother chose to smoke,
18      despite knowing the dangers her entire life.
19           Respectfully, ladies and gentlemen,
20      Plaintiff's claim for $4 million defies common
21      sense.
22           Remember, in reaching your verdict you
23      were instructed, do not let bias or sympathy
24      play a role.
25           Finally, on this verdict form, question No. 9, punitive damages.  You remember that
2      punitive damages can be awarded only for
3      concealment that was a legal cause of
4      Ms. Wilkinson's death.
5           You may not punish Reynolds for harm
6      suffered by anyone other than Ms. Wilkinson.
7      It is a very specific inquiry on the conduct
8      that you find to be connected to Ms. Wilkinson.
10           Punitive damages are in addition to
11      damages that fully compensate the Plaintiff and
12      Mr. Eugene Wilkinson.  And they can be awarded
13      only to Vivian Turner and Eugene Wilkinson, not
14      to anyone else, not to any other organizations.
15      Punitive damages only go to the Plaintiff and
16      Mr. Wilkinson.
17           And it is clear and convincing evidence.
18      It's the higher burden.  It's the highest
19      burden we have in civil trials.
20           Plaintiff has to prove to you by clear and
21      convincing evidence that, without hesitation,
22      they have met their burden, their higher
23      burden.
24           And what does that mean?  That means when
25      you are deliberating, if there is any hesitation or doubt Plaintiff has not met their
2      burden to prove to you entitlement to punitive
3      damages.
4           You may not consider the Engle findings in
5      determining whether punitive damages are
6      warranted, and they don't establish that
7      Plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages.
8           This is the key point: mitigating
9      evidence.  You may consider mitigating evidence
10      in determining punitive damages.
11           What did you hear from Dr. Cummings?  The
12      FDA has regulatory control over the tobacco
13      industry since 2009.  The federal government
14      has regulatory control over the tobacco
15      industry since 2009.
16           You have seen the warning labels.  You've
17      heard from Dr. Cummings:  CTR funded
18      $500 million of research, published scientific
19      and medical articles, 600 articles in the
20      Surgeon General's Reports, 10 Nobel Prize
21      winners, funded research at Ivy League
22      institutions and universities around Florida.
23           Should Reynolds be punished?  The evidence
24      clearly is no.
25           You saw CTR funded this article in 1963 which concluded that cigarette smoking was
2      addictive, sponsored in part by grants of the
3      American Cancer Society and the Tobacco
4      Industry Research Committee.  In 1963, they
5      funded that research.
6           You heard about Premier and Eclipse,
7      Reynolds' efforts to develop a safer cigarette.
8           Dr. Cummings admitted to you there is no
9      such thing as a safer cigarette; but he also
10      told you that Reynolds has tried to reduce the
11      level of cancer-causing chemicals in cigarettes
12      since the 1950s.
13           They started this heat-not-burn technology
14      to try to make a safer cigarette.  They spent
15      over a billion dollars to develop a less
16      harmful cigarette, but it failed because people
17      didn't like the taste.
18           And Dr. Cummings told you developing a
19      safer cigarette was a responsible thing to do;
20      and he told you that just because Premier
21      failed, Reynolds didn't stop.  They tried to do
22      it again later with that cigarette called
23      Eclipse.  They kept trying.
24           It demonstrates that Reynolds should not
25      be punished. You heard about youth smoking.  What did
2      Dr. Cummings admit?  Youth smoking rates have
3      drastically plummeted.  Florida has the second
4      lowest youth smoking rate in the country, after
5      Utah.
6           Today, 93 percent of Florida high school
7      students are not smoking, even a single
8      cigarette in a month.  That is youth smoking
9      today.  In Florida, nine out of 10 high school
10      students not smoking even a cigarette in a
11      month.
12           Ladies and gentlemen, when you get to the
13      question of compensatory damages, we submit to
14      you the answer should be zero for Ms. Turner
15      and Mr. Wilkinson.
16           And when you get to the question for the
17      entitlement to punitive damages, the Plaintiff
18      has not met that higher burden of clear and
19      convincing evidence, and your verdict should be
20      "no," if you get that far on the verdict form.
21           Ladies and gentlemen to wrap up, this case
22      is about one smoker, Ms. Wilkinson, who smoked
23      for 50 years, knowing smoking could kill her
24      and ruin her life.
25           I thank you on behalf of our team, on behalf of Plaintiffs and everybody, thank you
2      for your time, your attention, being prompt
3      every day.  We so appreciate it.  The system
4      would not work if it wasn't for you.
5           When you came to the courthouse, you guys
6      didn't choose to be on this case, but you were
7      selected.  We thank you for your diligent
8      attention.
9           The only thing we ask of you when you go
10      back into that jury room, take your guide book,
11      your instructions; you apply the legal
12      principles embodied in these instructions; you
13      apply them to the facts presented here; and we
14      ask that you return a complete defense verdict,
15      based on the overwhelming presentation in this
16      case for RJ Reynolds.  Thank you very much.
