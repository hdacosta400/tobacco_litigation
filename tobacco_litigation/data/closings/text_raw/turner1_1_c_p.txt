4           MR. ROSEN:  It has been just shy of two
5      weeks since we started this process, just shy
6      of two weeks, and I think we are actually a
7      little bit ahead of schedule.  So that's good.
8           I tried to move quickly through witnesses,
9      and I know sometimes things got a little bit
10      slow, but I hope that we presented some
11      interesting, unique issues, you got to learn
12      some science, medicine, and that you got to see
13      some great witnesses in this case.
14           The information that you now have, you
15      know, I really -- thinking about this, you
16      probably have more information about the
17      tobacco industry and smoking and health than
18      probably 99 percent of the US population.  I
19      feel confident in that.
20           And that information is powerful.  Okay?
21      Because I think -- I think I said this early on
22      in the case:  What you thought you knew about
23      cigarettes and about smokers and about the
24      cigarette industry might be very, very
25      different than what you learned in this courtroom.
2           I want to thank every one of you for your
3      patience and for sacrificing and being here on
4      behalf of Vivian and William.  We thank you.
5           All right.  And so now we are coming to
6      the end of this case, for you to make a
7      decision and to decide the outcome of who wins,
8      who loses, what is right, what is wrong.
9           And so what is going to happen in probably
10      a couple of hours is you are going to go back
11      to that jury room and you are going to get a
12      verdict form.
13           The Judge read you these instructions, and
14      you are going to have to review all of those
15      instructions.
16           You are going to have the verdict form.
17      The way I'm going to try to go through it is as
18      succinctly as possible.  You are going to have
19      the verdict form.  I'm going to run through it
20      right now with you to understand what the
21      issues are and what we are going to be talking
22      about.
23           You heard and saw a lot of evidence.  You
24      heard a lot of evidence about the tobacco
25      industry, and you heard and saw a lot of evidence about Vivian Wilkinson.
2           You heard about the Engle class and what
3      we need to prove and whose burden it is to
4      prove who is an Engle class member.
5           So we are going to start.  Hopefully, it
6      works.
7           About class membership:  "Was Vivian
8      Wilkinson addicted to cigarettes containing
9      nicotine, and if so, was that addiction a
10      cause, a legal cause of her COPD/emphysema?
11           You are going to see in those jury
12      instructions that it is not about fault, it is
13      not about what Vivian Wilkinson knew or she
14      didn't know.
15           This is the question:  "Was Vivian
16      Wilkinson addicted to cigarettes containing
17      nicotine, and if so, was such addiction a legal
18      cause of her chronic obstructive pulmonary
19      disease?"
20           If you answer is "no" to this question,
21      the case is over.  RJ Reynolds wins, and we go
22      home.
23           Okay.  If you answer is "yes," and I'm
24      confident you're going to answer "yes," that
25      Vivian Wilkinson was addicted to cigarettes and that her addiction was the legal cause of her
2      COPD, we are going to go on to the next
3      question.
4           But I want to talk about this first
5      question because you heard and saw a lot of
6      evidence whether addiction, about smoking, not
7      about fault -- it is not about whether addicts
8      can quit or not.  You're going to see, you're
9      to read the instruction.  It is not about that.
10      Nowhere in there does it talk about that,
11      whether the smoker shares any responsibility.
12      That is a question that is later on in the
13      verdict form.  And we are going to talk about
14      that later also.
15           It is not about whether she relied on
16      industry statements, what -- whether she relied
17      on what they were talking about.
18           And you are not going to see anything
19      about choice, okay?
20           It is not about whether she chose to smoke
21      or didn't choose to smoke.
22           We are going to talk about addiction and
23      the greater weight of the evidence.  That is
24      what we have to prove.  That is our burden,
25      whether by the greater weight of the evidence, the more persuasive and convincing portion of
2      the evidence, whether she was addicted and
3      whether that addiction caused disease.
4           Vivian Wilkinson was 13 years old when she
5      started smoking.  That is the evidence in this
6      case.  She was 13.
7           The time when she started smoking, you
8      know, was around in the 1940s.  I'm not going
9      to go through all of the advertisements.  We
10      went through a ton of advertisements.  I'm not
11      going to make you sit through more
12      advertisements.  You saw them all.
13           That was life back then.  It was a
14      different world.  People smoked everywhere.
15      Little kids.  This was her older brother.
16      Joseph Wicks says it was common for girls to
17      smoke.  He came back from the war and kids were
18      smoking.  All right?
19           It was a different time.  They were giving
20      out cigarettes to the soldiers back then.  All
21      right?  It was part of society.
22           I think the testimony and the evidence was
23      more than 50 percent of people in the United
24      States smoked.  And so it was a different
25      world, and she was 13 when she started smoking. And we have the history in her medical
2      records.  You saw the over 40 pack-year smoking
3      history, 40-pack-year history of smoking.
4           And her medical records, you know, they
5      want to deny it, but her medical record --
6           MR. ROSEN:  Objection, your Honor.
7           THE COURT:  Overruled.  This is argument.
8      Proceed.
9           MR. ROSEN:  They want to deny it, but this
10      is what the medical records say, her own
11      doctors that were treating her:  History of
12      tobacco abuse.
13           I asked Dr. Barnett, we are going to talk
14      about her in a minute:  Was there a history of
15      abuse?
16           She wouldn't agree that abuse is something
17      that people think about in terms of substance
18      abuse or addiction.  She wouldn't agree to it.
19      This is in her medical records.
20           There's another document here:  History
21      cigarette abuse.  It was actually written.
22      This is just some billing code.  No, it's in
23      the medical record.  It's a handwritten note.
24           And there was another diagnosis of
25      tobacco-use disorder.  All right? These are doctors, the people who were
2      responsible for her well-being.  This is what
3      they wrote.  And that was back in 1998.
4           And so the instruction that you are going
5      to get on legal cause is:  Was addiction to
6      cigarettes -- the addiction to cigarettes
7      containing nicotine is a legal cause.  It
8      doesn't have to be the only legal cause, but a
9      legal cause if it indirectly and in natural
10      sequence substantially produces so that it
11      reasonably can be said that but for the
12      addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine,
13      the COPD would not have occurred.
14           So, but for addiction, but for addiction,
15      would she have smoked for 40 years?  Forty
16      years, a pack of these a day.
17           If I sat here -- I was thinking about
18      doing it.  I'm not going to do it; it's going
19      to take too much time.  If I were to take one
20      cigarette at a time, put it in my mouth and
21      smoke it, put it down, and then took another
22      one and light it up and sit here, how long do
23      you think that is going to take?  That's one.
24      There's 20 in here.
25           Do you think someone is going to do that for 40 years if they weren't addicted?
2           And, again, there's no issue on choice.
3      You're not going to see anything regarding
4      choice on the legal cause of addiction causing
5      COPD.
6           Just remember, it's stipulated, it's that
7      her smoking caused the COPD.  Her smoking
8      caused her COPD and her COPD caused her death.
9      That is not even an issue.
10           So why did she continue to smoke for 40
11      years?  And I also talked about, this is called
12      a concurring-cause instruction:  Addiction
13      doesn't have to be the only cause.  All right?
14      It could act in combination with other factors.
15           I can go through the -- going to go
16      through this.  Listen, if you look at the
17      amount of time, the amount of time of her
18      lifetime smoking, it is astonishing.
19           This is one and a half packs.  You can go
20      more or less, depending on what you think she
21      smoked.  The testimony is on -- is in different
22      ranges.  Some people say a pack; medical
23      records say a pack; some say a pack and a half
24      to two packs.
25           But look at the actual time.  Using the substance over a lifetime is 12.5 years.  12.5
2      years of smoking.
3           Was she addicted to nicotine in
4      cigarettes?  Start at 13.  You heard the
5      testimony.  She smoked first thing in the
6      morning.  The pack a day, she would smoke
7      around her kids.  She would smoke before going
8      to sleep.  She would wake up in the middle of
9      the night.  She would smoke in the car filling
10      up gas.  You heard all of the testimony about
11      what this lady did, what Vivian Wilkinson did.
12      Okay?
13           And so, was it just because she loved the
14      way smoke -- the taste of smoke?  Did she --
15      did she love that so much, she just loved the
16      feel of a cigarette in her hand?  No.  It is
17      the nicotine.  And we are going to talk about
18      that in a minute.
19           You learned so much about it, all right?
20      And I suspect the things you didn't know
21      before, and I suspect you learned about the
22      things that they concealed and hidden what they
23      were doing with nicotine.
24           And we talked about her quit attempts.  I
25      mean, listen, I think William said on the stand, he says 50 times he remembers, and
2      Vivian was talking how many times, dozens.
3      There is no dispute she tried to quit many
4      times from the late '70s going forward, you
5      know?  And she wasn't successful.  She was
6      never successful.
7           She smoked all the time.  She would cry,
8      her brother would talk to her, her brother
9      Joseph Wicks, a 91-year-old guy, we have a
10      video of him, he would talk to the sister:  I
11      beg you, you've got to quit.  And she would
12      break down crying.  What would she say to him?
13      I'm trying, I'm trying to quit.
14           Did she want to smoke or did she want to
15      stop smoking?
16           And then, you know, again, Dr. Barnett
17      just denied any of these withdrawal symptoms.
18      You heard the testimony about how she would
19      become anxious.  She would get irritable,
20      become a different person.  Wake up William in
21      the morning, she would be a different person.
22      You knew that's when she was quitting.  That
23      was one of the days.
24           What happened?  It would only last a day
25      or two, and she would go back, because there's an incredible driving force behind what's in
2      this pack and in this cigarette.
3           This isn't just tobacco rolled up in a
4      piece of paper; this is sophisticated, highly
5      designed, highly engineered.
6           There is a reason 500,000 people die every
7      year from smoking.  Twenty million died since
8      the 1960s.  It is not because people just all
9      want to walk off a cliff.  There is a driving
10      force.  And they know it.  And they have known
11      it for years.  They are in the business of
12      selling nicotine.
13           That was -- that goes back to '63:  This
14      dominant specification should be nicotine
15      delivery.  It is a potent drug.  The industry
16      is based upon the design and sale of attractive
17      dosage forms.
18           This is a dosage form of nicotine.  This
19      is a dosage form of nicotine.  I thought this
20      was just a cigarette.
21           And it's an essential commodity in a
22      habitual act.  They talked about it in records.
23      They compared smokers to rats.  They are going
24      to keep going back and hitting that lever
25      because they need it. You know, they admit that she smoked
2      enough to get COPD, but not enough to be
3      addicted?
4           She smoked enough to get a deadly chronic
5      illness, but not to be addicted?
6           And so you think about that.
7           Dr. Barnett, they brought an expert for
8      you to -- a psychiatrist.  I had the chance to
9      cross-examine her.  You heard about who she is.
10      Before she was contacted by the tobacco
11      lawyers, she never did any type of research on
12      nicotine addiction.  It was never published.
13      She wasn't any type of authority in the field
14      of tobacco use or abuse.  I mean, she's a
15      psychiatrist.  That's fine, okay?
16           And, really, I mean, I understand she's a
17      medical director for this public corporation,
18      where she's creating a sleep apnea program.
19      Maybe that's her thing, but addiction to
20      nicotine, that's not her thing.  That is not
21      her thing.
22           She advertised her services, and now the
23      industry hires her.  How many cases has she
24      been hired to talk about -- in every single
25      case she's testified, none of the smokers are addicted.
2           There was a person, she had a guy, 35
3      pack-a-day smoker, not addicted, right?
4           And so you'll have the opportunity to
5      weigh her credibility, and you can reject her
6      testimony.  That is what the instruction said,
7      okay?  And I suspect you will.
8           What did she say about the Surgeon General
9      of the United States?  "I don't find him to be
10      authoritative."
11           The Surgeon General, who's been writing
12      about this since 1964, who publishes every
13      year, we have the book, I was asking Dr. Farber
14      questions about it yesterday, but, I mean, the
15      Surgeon General is not an authority on smoking
16      and health?
17           And then what was -- this -- you know,
18      this shows where she comes from:  That
19      someone -- this was a question that was asked
20      by defense counsel:  Someone who continues to
21      smoke, is addiction a factor?  No.
22           How is addiction not a factor in someone's
23      continued use of an addictive substance?
24           It makes no sense.  No sense at all.
25           This was the testimony, this was the evidence on addiction, is that every single
2      person, from Vivian, to her doctors, to her
3      medical records, all say she's addicted.  Who
4      is the only person?  Dr. Barnett.  No, she's
5      not addicted; she wasn't addicted.
6           And so you will have to -- you will make
7      this decision.
8           I mean, this is what they say internally:
9      Without the chemical compound, the cigarette
10      market would collapse, we would lose our jobs
11      and consulting fees.
12           These are internal documents that weren't
13      available, and you learned about these
14      documents.  And that's going to be important:
15      About the timing, when this stuff came to
16      light.
17           This stuff didn't come to light until the
18      1990s, right?  And that's going to be something
19      that you're going to decide.  They are going to
20      argue that she should have known, she should
21      have known she had a disease caused by smoking,
22      when all of this information, what they knew,
23      didn't come out until the 1990s.  But she
24      should have known about it before 1990.  We are
25      going to get to that. This was another important document.  And
2      all of these are in evidence.  You can look
3      through them.  Examine them, read them.  They
4      are very interesting.
5           And this is a window into the soul of RJ
6      Reynolds and these other companies:  We cannot
7      ever be comfortable selling a product which
8      most of our customers would stop using if they
9      could.
10           They know their customers can't stop.  And
11      the exit gate suddenly opened.  If people are
12      going to stop smoking, they're going to be out
13      of business overnight.
14           What do they have to do?  They have to
15      make the cigarette more addictive so people
16      keep smoking.
17           Was Vivian Wilkinson addicted to
18      cigarettes containing nicotine?  The answer is
19      "yes."  For No. 1, the answer is "yes," okay?
20           And you're going to have the verdict form
21      back there.  I don't know if I have a copy of
22      it.  That's all right.
23           And so when she's a class member, that's
24      the class membership question.  Is she a class
25      member? You apply these findings.  The findings
2      apply in this case, okay?
3           Reynolds concealed material -- omitted
4      material information that was not otherwise
5      known or available.
6           That's what they did.  Those findings are
7      binding.  If they didn't -- and that's going to
8      apply in this case.
9           What else?  Reynolds agreed with other
10      companies to conceal or omit information
11      regarding the health effects of cigarettes or
12      their addictive nature, and they did it with
13      the intention that the public would rely on it.
14      Okay?  They did it intending for the public to
15      rely on it.  Those are two that are so
16      important.
17           Then No. 3:  They placed these cigarettes
18      in the market that are defective, cigarettes
19      that have ammonia compounds, okay, that change
20      the form of nicotine, so that it absorbs
21      faster, gets to the brain.  That is effective.
22      That is the problem.
23           And then smoking cigarettes causes
24      disease, including COPD.  Remember something,
25      okay?  Remember, before these findings, before these -- the jury found these findings, they
2      denied all of this.  They denied all of it.
3           And we saw the video.  We are going to
4      show you a couple in a little bit.  They said
5      historically, right up until 2000, cigarette
6      smoking doesn't cause disease; our products
7      aren't injurious to human health.  If there is
8      an issue with them, we will remove it.
9           They lied to everybody, to their
10      customers, to the -- to everybody.
11           And you know why they lied?  They lied for
12      money.  And I'm going to get into that a little
13      bit more when we talk about punitive damages.
14           But this was a corporation that lied,
15      concealed, denied, deceived, with the purpose
16      and motive and intent, okay?  And the reason --
17      the motivation was money.  A lot of money.
18           The next question is going to be the
19      statute of limitations defense, and the Judge
20      is going to give you -- has given you some
21      instructions on whether she knew or should have
22      known before May 5th, 1990, that by the
23      exercise of reasonable care, she should have
24      known before May 5th, 1990, that she had COPD,
25      and that there was a reasonable possibility that it was caused by cigarette smoking.
2           Vivian Turner's testimony.  This is her
3      daughter.  This is the person who lived with
4      her, who saw her.  She was at -- Vivian
5      Wilkinson was at her daughter's wedding.  And
6      we showed you a picture of her smoking at the
7      wedding.
8           The question is:  Before 1992, did you see
9      her use an inhaler?
10           Never.
11           Before 1992, at your wedding, did you see
12      her having shortness of breath?
13           Never.
14           Did you ever see her wheezing before 1992?
15           No.
16           Coughing of sputum?
17           No.
18           Hacking cough?
19           No.
20           Nothing before 1992.  I mean, that is
21      critical.
22           Before 1992, did you see her having a
23      smoking cough?
24           No.
25           Tell us about your mom at the wedding, all right?
2           And she talked about her mom.  She was
3      walking around.  She was dancing.  She was
4      having a good time, okay?
5           In 1992, if she had this severe emphysema
6      that Dr. Farber talked about yesterday, she had
7      a severe emphysema by 1993, she couldn't do
8      anything.  There is no way she's walking around
9      like this, having a good time, dancing at the
10      wedding.  There is no way.  It doesn't happen.
11           And you have photos of her.  You heard
12      about the Colorado trip even after she was
13      diagnosed.  This lady went to Colorado and was
14      able to spend time and run around and do things
15      with the kids and the family.
16           William Wilkinson.  And you heard this
17      gentleman spent a lot of time with his mom at
18      the beauty parlor.  Poor guy.  At the beauty
19      parlor, okay?
20           He joined the military in 1987, rose to
21      the ranks of the top 1 percent of the United
22      States military, retired chief master sergeant,
23      okay?  It is the highest ranking for an
24      enlisted personnel.  It is comparable to a
25      general, okay?  This man has led squadrons, all right?
2           Before you joined the military -- and this
3      is testimony under oath, 1987:  Before you
4      joined the military in 1978, did you see your
5      mom using an inhaler?
6           No, sir.
7           Before you joined the military, any
8      shortness of breath?
9           No.
10           Before you joined the military in 1987,
11      had you observed any health problems?
12           No, sir.
13           And between 1989 and 1991 when you visited
14      your mother, how as her health?
15           It was excellent.  She was in great
16      physical condition.
17           This is absolutely consistent with the
18      medical records that we have in this case, all
19      of the documentation.
20           Did there come a time in the early 1990s
21      where you learned your mom was diagnosed?
22           Yes, sir.
23           What year?
24           '93.
25           He remembered exactly where she was, and before that time, at the very bottom of this,
2      he talks about how no observations of his mom
3      having shortness of breath, breathing problems
4      or using inhalers.
5           1993.  That's when she was diagnosed.
6           And we have the medical record, and you
7      are going to see it in evidence, right?  It
8      states right there.  This is April 20th, 1993.
9           She has a 40-year smoking history, who has
10      noted progressive shortness of breath over the
11      period of the last six months.  Much worse in
12      the past three days.
13           All right.  That's 1993, when she was
14      diagnosed with COPD.
15           And the defense is arguing that she should
16      have known back in the 1980s that she had COPD.
17      She should have known about it.
18           And what was her report to the nurse?  You
19      know, how long did you have these symptoms that
20      you couldn't breathe?  It was last Wednesday.
21      That's what she reported.
22           Dr. Barry Reed.  I asked him questions.
23      Based upon your review of the records, was
24      there any notation or any symptoms or anything
25      relating to COPD before April of 1993? No.
2           Was there any evidence of symptoms
3      associated with Vivian Wilkinson's COPD prior
4      to May 5th, 1990?
5           No.
6           Now, the testimony is that if you have a
7      certain level of COPD -- because it's a slowly
8      progressing disease.  It takes time to develop,
9      okay?  If she has either moderate or severe
10      COPD in 1993, she's probably going to have some
11      level of it before 1990, okay?  She's probably
12      going to have -- it doesn't mean she should
13      have known about it.  It doesn't mean she
14      should have found out about it.
15           The records here show she went in 1993 to
16      the doctor.  There's more records that suggest
17      she was actually seen by other doctors before
18      that, and she never reported being diagnosed
19      with COPD.
20           Do any of the records indicate before
21      May 5th that she was having symptoms?
22           No.
23           Again, this is her doctor.  This isn't an
24      expert from Indiana, flying down here to
25      testify in Court.  This is a doctor that has his office in Miami, who still sees patients
2      down here, who takes care of his pulmonary
3      patients on a daily basis, and who is the
4      person who was there on the front lines taking
5      care of Vivian, trying to keep her alive,
6      trying to keep her from suffocating to death.
7           This is what he has to say about the
8      information with respect to whether or not she
9      had COPD before 1990, whether she had symptoms
10      associated with it.
11           And I asked him, because this was
12      important, because everyone is saying that she
13      had this certain level of COPD in 1990, in
14      1993.
15           And this is Dr. Gidel.  This was the
16      doctor that diagnosed her.  If you look at the
17      record, he doesn't write "severe COPD."  He
18      says:  COPD, decompensating chronic obstructive
19      pulmonary disease.
20           And he testified that when you are having
21      an acute exacerbation, meaning you have to go
22      to -- you are going because you have an acute
23      bronchitis, which the medical records show she
24      had, okay, when you go in, in that condition,
25      and you give a pulmonary function test, it is going to be different.
2           And Dr. Farber yesterday agreed with that.
3      He agreed you are not supposed to give someone
4      a pulmonary function test if they are having
5      exacerbation, because it shows abnormal or more
6      abnormal results than a normal test would show.
7           Is it hard to tell how severe her COPD was
8      just based on the pulmonary function test
9      because she was suffering from an exacerbation
10      during that time?
11           Yes.
12           That is the doctor who was taking care of
13      her back then.
14           And Dr. Farber, their expert, admitted he
15      wouldn't order a PFT if the person was not at
16      baseline.
17           She was not at baseline.  She was two days
18      there into a five-day stay at the hospital.
19      And the records say that they actually had her
20      do it at bedside because she couldn't get up.
21      She wasn't well enough.  She was so ill at the
22      time she couldn't get up and go give the
23      pulmonary function test.
24           What else?  Dr. Farber, every case he's
25      hired, never found someone to be a member of the Engle class.  It's impossible for people to
2      become a member of the Engle class, right?  I
3      mean, she's diagnosed in 1993.
4           He agreed that the definitive test of COPD
5      is a pulmonary function test.  A pulmonary
6      function test is what diagnoses COPD.
7           She never had one before 1993.  There is
8      no evidence that she ever had one before 1993.
9      And even if she had shortness of breath, it is
10      not always associated with COPD.
11           A person can have 50 percent of their
12      lungs operating, 50 percent of lung function
13      and not have symptoms.
14           And he agreed he's not seen a person with
15      severe COPD work full-time on their feet.
16           The testimony is you have Social Security
17      earnings records.  Vivian Wilkinson was on her
18      feet bartending all throughout this time.  She
19      gets sick in 1993; she's back on her feet and
20      back working.
21           And this talk about -- he agreed this was
22      an article that he said was authoritative that
23      he cited.  It is normal for people to show up
24      late in the disease of COPD.  It is normal,
25      right? And so, you know, listen, in hindsight,
2      can anyone go to a doctor earlier?  Or hope
3      that maybe if they go to the doctor, the doctor
4      is going to get the right diagnosis?
5           This says with chronic obstructive
6      pulmonary disease, people seek it late.
7           And my question to him:  Is it normal, not
8      unreasonable, is it normal for people to go
9      late to the doctor late in the disease of COPD?
10           Then he also agreed to the fact that
11      people even with COPD, when they start to
12      develop either shortness of breath or
13      something, they modify what they are doing,
14      right?
15           They probably do it subconsciously.  They
16      start to shift things around a little bit so
17      they are not feeling like they were.  It's not
18      unreasonable for someone to go late when they
19      get diagnosed.
20           What is their burden of proof?  We talked
21      about our burden of proof.  We talked about our
22      burden of proof.
23           On the statute of limitations, they need
24      to prove it to you.  That is their burden.  All
25      right?  That she knew or should have known by the use of exercising reasonable care that she
2      had COPD and it was caused by smoking.  That is
3      their burden.
4           And this is the burden of proof on that
5      issue.  On that issue.  Right?
6           Every witness, every medical record, no
7      symptoms prior to 1990, except who?  Barbara
8      Walsh, okay?  Barbara Walsh.
9           And what did she say regarding symptoms?
10 11           "QUESTION:  You said before that you
12      didn't observe her wheezing, right?
13           "ANSWER:  No, I don't recall her wheezing
14      from it."
15           "QUESTION:  You don't remember her having
16      a chronic cough, a hacking cough?  You don't --
17           "ANSWER:  No.
18           "QUESTION:  -- remember her ever having a
19      chronic cough?
20           "ANSWER:  No.
21           "QUESTION:  You don't remember her
22      coughing up sputum?
23           "ANSWER:  No.  Lord, no."
24           (The video clip ended.)
25           MR. ROSEN:  And she's asked about these inhalers.  She's asked about inhalers, and
2      counsel got to ask this question.  He asked
3      her:  Did you -- did you associate Vivian
4      Wilkinson's shortness of breath with smoking?
5           And what was her answer?
6           No.
7           There was no association, because back
8      then they didn't talk about it.  It wasn't an
9      issue.
10           And you want to know why it wasn't an
11      issue?  I'm not going to play this, but she
12      talked -- she had conflicting testimony about
13      how often she actually saw Vivian Wilkinson.
14           In one sentence she says:  Well, I would
15      see her two or three times a week.
16           You know, let's just play it.
17 18           "QUESTION:  Were there times in the 1980s
19      where you wouldn't see her for weeks or even
20      months?
21           "ANSWER:  Yeah.  It would depend on my
22      work schedule."
23           (The video clip ended.)
24           MR. ROSEN:  So she didn't see her all the
25      time.  It wasn't every week.  That's the testimony from William also, is that when he
2      would go, she wasn't always there.
3           What else was going on?  I mean, the
4      argument, the argument is that she knew or she
5      should have known that she had COPD and that it
6      was caused by cigarette smoking.
7           They want to hold -- the defense wants to
8      hold Vivian Wilkinson to a higher standard than
9      their own CEOs and executives.
10           I mean, you remember the open debate
11      campaign.  Let's see what the CEO of RJ
12      Reynolds Tobacco Company was saying in the
13      1980s about whether smoking caused emphysema.
14      That's what they say she should have known:  It
15      was caused by smoking.
16 17           >>:  Cigarette smoking does not cause
18      cancer, yes or no?
19           >>:  It is not known whether cigarettes
20      cause cancer.  It has not been causally
21      established.
22           >>:  Cigarette smoking, no causal
23      relationship between cigarette smoking and
24      emphysema?
25           >>:  Despite all of the research to date, there has been no causal link established.
2           >>:  No causal relationship between
3      cigarette smoking and heart disease?
4           >>:  No.  As a matter of fact, there are
5      studies that while we are accused of being
6      associated with heart disease, there have been
7      studies conducted over 10 years that would say,
8      again, that science is still puzzled over these
9      forces.
10           (The video clip ended.)
11           MR. ROSEN:  That is the CEO of R.J.
12      Reynolds, this company, the company that
13      counsel represents, all right?  The Defendant
14      in this courtroom.
15           The CEO in the 1980s is saying that
16      cigarettes don't cause emphysema.  That's the
17      manufacturer of this product that Vivian
18      Wilkinson is smoking.
19           She had a right to believe them, okay?
20      And they can't come in 30 years later and say
21      that she should have known, she should have
22      known we were lying about that and concealing
23      information about that.  She should have known
24      it.  She was much smarter than we were.
25           I mean, they spent -- and I'm going to talk about this.  The resources and the amount
2      of money and effort that they put behind this
3      machine was tremendous.  All right?
4           They talk about, can we have an open
5      debate campaign?  That was part of the huge
6      campaign in the 1980s, where they're talking,
7      there's other evidence.  Some people are saying
8      it's harmful.  Here, there's other evidence.
9      You're ignoring the significant evidence to the
10      contrary.  Our product is not harmful.
11           Where were we?  Back then, we were coming
12      to the peak of smoking, all right?  We're at
13      the peak.
14           This is the same gentleman that I just
15      played the video of, all right?  This is the
16      same gentleman under oath, in 1994, a year
17      after Vivian Wilkinson was diagnosed with COPD.
18      All right?
19           Now he's the former CEO of RJ Reynolds in
20      1994.
21           Does cigarette smoking cause cancer?
22           Not in my opinion.
23           What is that opinion based on?
24           The fact that there continues to be
25      statistics that underlie the issue or problem. There's still no scientific link that there's a
2      direct cause-and-effect relationship.
3           Does cigarette smoking cause any diseases?
4           Not in my opinion.
5           Fundamentally, he believes that.  All
6      right?
7           They can't hold Vivian Wilkinson to a
8      higher standard.  They can't do that.  They
9      can't say she was negligent for not going to a
10      doctor, when they lied and deceived and told
11      the public that their product didn't cause
12      harm.
13           This is the actual CEO in 1994.  All
14      right?  They lined up.  And this is in
15      deposition he testifies:
16           Is it your position that it has never been
17      proven that cigarette smoking has caused a
18      single person to die?
19           That is my position, yes.
20           That is the head of the head, the top
21      person at RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company.
22           So on the statute of limitations defense,
23      on whether she knew or should have known, look
24      at the medical records, the ideas -- look at
25      what is the more persuasive and convincing force and effect of the entire evidence.  The
2      entire evidence in this case.  And the answer
3      to this is no.
4           If you answer "yes" to this question,
5      Plaintiff loses.  We go home.  The case is
6      over.  RJ Reynolds wins, okay?
7           If the answer to this question is "no,"
8      she did not know before, and she shouldn't have
9      reasonably, through the exercise of reasonable
10      care, have known.
11           Was smoking cigarettes manufactured by RJ
12      Reynolds a legal cause of Vivian Wilkinson's
13      COPD and emphysema?
14           I don't think this should be an argument.
15      It's admitted, it's stipulated that smoking
16      caused her disease, all right?
17           Smoking, even their own expert talks
18      about -- this is a stipulation:  Smoking
19      cigarettes was the cause of her emphysema and
20      COPD.  She died from COPD and emphysema, right?
21           We have the testimony from Vivian Turner,
22      her daughter, talking about the earliest memory
23      is Lucky Strike.  That's RJ Reynolds.
24           There was Winstons all through the '60s,
25      into the '70s, right?  It was RJ Reynolds brand cigarettes.  It was Winston and Viceroy.  There
2      was Parliament, which is not an RJ Reynolds
3      brand cigarettes.
4           And that happened -- oh, and also, even
5      after she switched, even after she switched to
6      other -- to Parliament, she still saw her mom
7      would smoke Pall Mall, Barclay, and I believe
8      True.  Pall Mall, Barclay, those are both RJ
9      Reynolds brand cigarettes.
10           So even after she switched to Parliament,
11      occasionally she would be smoking still RJ
12      Reynolds' cigarettes.
13           This talks about, again, through her high
14      school years and when did you make the switch.
15           Yes, it was after I graduated high school
16      or around there.
17           All right?  And then who testified with
18      the -- with the memory, all right?  Of spending
19      quality time with his mother, all right?  At
20      the beauty parlor, right?  What does he say?
21           When did your mother switch from smoking
22      the Winston, the Viceroy to smoking Parliament?
23           It would have been after 1978, when we
24      started going to the beauty parlor, and he had
25      a distinct memory.  I asked him, do you have a distinct memory of that?
2           Yes.
3           So we have a smoking history of RJ
4      Reynolds brand cigarettes; we have actual
5      evidence, people talking about it, right from
6      the '60s into the late '70s, all right?
7           Now, let's talk about -- because they want
8      you to think that Vivian Turner -- excuse me
9      Vivian Wilkinson --
10           MR. ROSEN:  Objection, your Honor.  As to
11      what we want.
12           THE COURT:  Sustained.
13           MR. ROSEN:  I mean, the evidence here is
14      not that Vivian Wilkinson all of a sudden
15      started smoking Lucky Strike the first time
16      that Vivian Turner remembered seeing her mom.
17           Vivian Turner stuck with cigarettes for a
18      very long time.  She stuck with Parliaments for
19      a very long time, Winstons, Viceroy.  It's not
20      that all of a sudden she popped up smoking
21      Viceroy -- excuse me -- popped up smoking Lucky
22      Strike.
23           Lucky Strikes were huge.  RJ Reynolds'
24      market share was huge, and I'm going to show
25      you that, but what does Joe Wicks remember about cigarettes when he was growing up, back
2      when they were kids?
3           He remembers Lucky Strike advertising:
4           Smoke, I seen them come out of the
5      airplane, Lucky Strike in the sky.
6           You remember as a boy seeing a plane
7      flying over?
8           They would have planes flying over, okay?
9      With smoke that says "Lucky Strike."
10           And this gentleman, 91 years old,
11      remembered that from back in the '40s or '30s,
12      whenever he remembered it.
13           And what other brand does Joe Wicks
14      remember with respect to RJ Reynolds?
15           Go ahead.
16 17           "QUESTION:  What brand of cigarettes did
18      you see your sister smoke?
19           "ANSWER:  I don't know that.  I thought it
20      was Winston.
21           "QUESTION:  You said you don't know, but
22      you thought it was Winston.  Why did you think
23      it was Winston?
24           "ANSWER:  Because I remember seeing the
25      packs lay around, the Winston cigarette packs. "QUESTION:  Where did you see the packs?
2           "ANSWER:  In her house.
3           "QUESTION:  When did you see the packs?
4           "ANSWER:  God, what year, I don't know.
5      Because her husband smoked.  You know, they all
6      smoked.
7           "QUESTION:  Did you ever see Vivian take a
8      cigarette out of the packs of cigarettes and
9      smoke it?
10           "ANSWER:  Yeah, I seen her take it out of
11      the packs.
12           (The video clip ended.)
13           MR. ROSEN:  He remembers Winston.  He
14      remembers Lucky Strike as being the heavily
15      advertised cigarette.
16           And then we have the documents.  These are
17      in evidence.  The big three.
18           Okay.  What cigarette do you think she was
19      smoking before -- before Vivian Turner can
20      testify about what her memory is?  What do you
21      think she was smoking?
22           This is -- RJ Reynolds has 70 -- over
23      70 percent of the market, 70 percent of the
24      market, and the other part of the market share
25      was Chesterfield.  And no one said anything about her smoking Chesterfield.  They do
2      remember her smoking Lucky Strikes.
3           This was her doctor.  I asked him just a
4      question:
5           Just assuming, let's just assume that she
6      just smoked RJ Reynolds brands for a 10-year
7      period, from '65 to '75.  Is that a substantial
8      contributing caution of COPD in 1993?
9           "ANSWER:  Yes, they substantially
10      contributed."
11           Everyone agrees, you can't just pull it
12      out.  You can't say smoking those brands didn't
13      contribute substantially to producing the
14      disease.
15           This was their expert:
16           Do you agree that the total smoking
17      history, every year of it, contributes to the
18      development of COPD?
19           Yes.
20           And you agree that a person's history of
21      smoking which contributes is cumulative?
22           Yes.
23           Then I asked him:
24           And you agree if someone smokes one brand
25      from '46 to '65 and then switches and smokes another brand for the next 10 years?
2           What was his answer?
3           "Each cigarette contributes to COPD,
4      whatever brand.
5           "Was smoking cigarettes manufactured by RJ
6      Reynolds a legal cause of her COPD/emphysema?
7           "Yes."
8           Okay?  The answer is "yes."
9           Now I want to talk about punitive damages,
10      the path to punitive damages.  All right?
11           There's going to be two questions on the
12      verdict form, and it has to do with reliance.
13      It has to do with whether or not Vivian
14      Wilkinson relied on their lies and whether she
15      relied on their conspiracy to lie.
16           And this is the first question:  Did
17      Vivian Wilkinson reasonably rely to her
18      detriment on any statements of material fact
19      made by the Defendants?
20           We know, we know with the findings we
21      have, the Engle findings, they did it.  They
22      concealed material information.  They failed to
23      disclose material facts.
24           The question is whether she relied on
25      their fraud, all right?  And then the next question on this topic, on this issue, first
2      let's talk about fraud, what they concealed.
3      All right?
4           And Dr. Cummings talked about this, about
5      the modern cigarette, about the flue-curing,
6      about sugars, making it more inhalable.
7           It wasn't inhalable.  The disease of lung
8      cancer didn't exist before 1900.  That's an
9      epidemic that was created and sustained by this
10      company.  All right?  By the tobacco companies.
11           It didn't exist, and we have the chart
12      here, and you've seen the chart.
13           But, I mean, this is lung cancer.  It
14      doesn't exist before 1900.  Okay?  And it was
15      with the advent, the invention of the Camel
16      cigarette, the modern cigarette.
17           Additives:  They would put additives to
18      adjust the pH, to maintain certain levels of
19      nicotine.
20           Bronchodilator.  Bronchodilators.  Their
21      expert, Farber, talked about what a
22      bronchodilator is.  It relaxes the lungs,
23      right?  It makes -- you are able to breathe
24      easier.
25           They put bronchodilators in cigarettes. The amount of carcinogens and deadly chemicals
2      that are in this cigarette, that they know
3      about, that they've always known about, right?
4      They put bronchodilators so people can inhale
5      them easier into their lungs.
6           Did Vivian Wilkinson know that?  Did she
7      know that they were adjusting the pH and
8      manipulating the levels of nicotine, putting
9      flavors in it to make it easier to smoke?  Leaf
10      blending to manipulate nicotine?  Filter vents?
11           She switched to filters.  She switched to
12      filters.  She believed they were safer.  She
13      switched to light cigarettes.  She tried those
14      because she thought they were safer.
15           Ammoniation.  They put ammonia in
16      cigarettes.  Ammonia, like the stuff under your
17      sink, in a cigarette because it freebases
18      nicotine.  It changes the form of the nicotine
19      so that it gets into the system faster, and it
20      has a higher impact and addiction potential.
21           Reynolds is legally responsible for the
22      conduct and the statements made by the other
23      companies and The Tobacco Institute and CTR.
24      That is the law of this case, right?
25           There was a conspiracy, and whenever everyone gets together for a conspiracy, the
2      other people making statements, right, you are
3      all together in it, and they are bound by that.
4           And so what did the industry conceal?  We
5      went through a ton of evidence, and I tried to
6      keep it interesting, and Dr. Cummings was here,
7      and we talked about all of the documents.
8           They formed a conspiracy.  Right?  They
9      formed a conspiracy to conceal the health
10      effects.  They met at that Plaza Hotel.  We
11      have the documents.  You saw the documents.
12      They hired doctors and scientists to mislead
13      the public.  They misled the Surgeon General.
14           They knew how highly addictive nicotine
15      was, and they concealed and lied about it.
16      They publicly stated it wasn't addictive.
17           They studied teenagers, the base of their
18      market.  They knew that teenagers, kids,
19      children were the base of their market, and if
20      they couldn't get these kids, if they couldn't
21      target these kids, their business would fall
22      apart; they would go out of business.  Right?
23      They talked about how the rise and decline of
24      every industry deals with the youth market.
25           I mean, 50 percent of all smokers die. Right?  They knew how many people it was
2      killing, and they lied about it.
3           We just talked about this, but as far as
4      what they knew about manipulating the levels of
5      nicotine, about the chemicals in their
6      cigarettes; that the filters weren't working;
7      that they were an illusion; that everyone is
8      buying and smoking filters; they think they are
9      better, they think they are safer, it doesn't
10      work, it's a joke.
11           And this was the goal:  How to free
12      millions of Americans from the guilty fear that
13      is going to arise deep in the biological depths
14      every time they light a cigarette.
15           That's what they did.  All right?  They
16      embarked on a multibillion dollar campaign,
17      with more power, more resources, right, and
18      more drive, right?  To convince and to confuse
19      and create doubt, so that people keep smoking.
20      And it worked.
21           And along the way, 20 million people died.
22      Vivian Wilkinson was one of those people.
23           They boasted about it.  This was in the
24      1950s.  Internal documents we didn't have
25      before. Their scientists are saying:  Fortunate
2      for us, cigarettes are a habit they can't
3      break.  Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our
4      company was the first to produce a cancer-free
5      cigarette?
6           They made public statements about whether
7      or not -- the industry got together, and they
8      made a public statement to reassure the public
9      we're going to look into it; we're going to
10      help society.
11           They lied about it.  They state they
12      believe their products aren't injurious.  They
13      are going to cooperate closely with the public.
14           Did they cooperate closely with the
15      public?  Ask yourself that.  When you're
16      answering the question of, was there reliance
17      by Vivian Wilkinson, ask if they cooperated
18      with public health, or did they lie to them or
19      they deceive them, whether they attacked the
20      Surgeon General and other public health
21      authorities.
22           And they knew, they knew -- we have these
23      documents, you know -- they knew how deadly and
24      how devastating this product was that they are
25      selling to billions of people, okay? They knew how deadly it was, and they
2      just kept it quiet and kept selling and
3      selling, and people kept buying and people kept
4      dying.
5           1958:  The individuals we met with believe
6      that smoking causes lung cancer.
7           1961:  Carcinogens are found in every
8      class of compound of smoke.
9           This is an RJ Reynolds document, 1962:
10      The amount of evidence accumulated to indict
11      cigarettes is overwhelming.  The evidence
12      challenge is scant.
13           B&W document.  This is an RJ Reynolds
14      document, 1963:  Cigarettes have certain
15      unattractive side effects.  Unattractive side
16      effects.  They cause lung cancer.
17           Human suffering.  Human suffering.  And
18      you're going to hear about human suffering, and
19      I'm required to talk to you about it.
20           And if they didn't form this conspiracy,
21      and they didn't put together this Tobacco
22      Industry Research Committee, this fake
23      scientific organization, right, they would be
24      in a deplorable position.
25           They knew about it.  It was a defensive operation.  It wasn't to help anyone.  They
2      wanted to provide psychological crutches to
3      smokers.  Obviously, the key word is
4      "confusion."  Doubt is our product.
5           The most important story is that which
6      casts doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of
7      disease and smoking.
8           I mean, is that responsible?  Is that what
9      a responsible corporation would do?
10           That is -- you know, punitive damages,
11      that is premeditated.  That is deliberate.
12      That is intentional.  Right?  That is first
13      degree.  Okay?
14           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor,
15      motion.
16           THE COURT:  Sustained.
17           MR. ROSEN:  This is what they said.
18 19           >>:  We want to be the detective just as
20      much as the Surgeon General and the AMA.  We
21      will cooperate in every way.
22           Well, obviously, a filter takes out
23      certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think the
24      industry admits there are any bad elements.
25           If there are bad elements, through our laboratory, through the Surgeon General,
2      through the AMA, through acts of God and luck,
3      we hope we may find them.  If they are found,
4      they will be removed.
5           >>:  We do talk to the question of whether
6      or not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not
7      believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We
8      don't accept that because when, as and if any
9      ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified as
10      being injurious to human health, we are
11      confident that we can eliminate that
12      ingredient.
13           (The video clip ended.)
14           MR. ROSEN:  It was the same line over and
15      over and over and over again.  And they wanted
16      people to rely on it.  That was the industry.
17      The industry wanted people to rely on it.
18           And you know what?  People relied on it.
19      Vivian Wilkinson relied on it.
20           Go ahead.
21           (Thereupon, a video clip played as
22      follows:)
23           "QUESTION:  They wanted people to be able
24      to believe them and rely upon them, did they
25      not? "ANSWER:  I believe in general, yes.
2           "QUESTION:  As late as '88, '89 or '90,
3      The Tobacco Institute was saying they didn't
4      know whether smoking caused cancer, correct?
5      That's what they were telling the public,
6      correct?
7           "ANSWER:  They did not know.  They could
8      not make that determination, is what they said
9      on the video.
10           "QUESTION:  And they wanted the people to
11      believe them, correct?
12           "ANSWER:  I would say they would, yes."
13           (The video clip ended.)
14           MR. ROSEN:  They wanted people to rely on
15      it.  It worked.  It was effective.
16           And this is -- this is their -- this is
17      right -- the strategy was brilliantly conceived
18      and executed over years, right?  They talked
19      about it in their documents, how the strategy
20      was brilliantly conceived and worked.
21           And this was the most -- when I read this,
22      you know, when I read this, a holding strategy,
23      right?  Think about a holding strategy.  The
24      holding strategy is people are smoking and
25      dying so that they can make more money.  All right?  A lot of money.  $250 billion was just
2      their marketing expenses over these years.  A
3      holding strategy.
4           I mean, the families and the people that
5      suffered from this.  All right?  Vivian Turner
6      watched her mom suffocate to death.
7           Important battles for them?  This was
8      important for human life.  Right?  For just
9      normal, everyday people, who didn't know what
10      they knew.
11           That the TIRC was a shield and enacted as
12      a front.  The tobacco money:  The CTR was the
13      best and cheapest insurance that money could
14      buy, that the industry could buy.  Let's pay
15      these fake organizations that we created.  It's
16      the best insurance we've got.
17           Because if they keep lying, they are going
18      to keep spreading doubt, and people are going
19      to keep smoking.
20           Again, they talk in the documents, who
21      ain't for more money?  Right?  They didn't want
22      to be regulated.  Do we really want to tout
23      cigarette smoke as a drug?  It is, of course,
24      but there are dangerous FDA implications.
25           I mean, this talks about they -- they are dealing -- they are dealing with
2      representatives, right?  They have contacts
3      with senators and representatives.
4           They influence society from the highest,
5      highest level.
6           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
7      Motion in limine instruction.
8           THE COURT:  Sustained.  Move on, Counsel.
9           MR. ROSEN:  They influenced doctors.  They
10      influenced scientists.  Right?  They influenced
11      the public.  They influenced consumers.
12           And they knew filters -- the carcinogens
13      are found -- this is what they told the Surgeon
14      General, right?  This is an internal document
15      that Philip Morris wrote:  Carcinogens are
16      found in practically every compound in smoke.
17      Present technology does not permit selective
18      filtration.
19           What did they write to the Surgeon General
20      two years later:  None of the chemical
21      substances listed therein, to our knowledge,
22      have been found by scientific research to be
23      harmful to health.  It is possible, of course,
24      to modify chemical components of cigarettes by
25      the use of filters. And they wrote that letter, Philip Morris
2      wrote that letter on behalf of all the tobacco
3      companies, including RJ Reynolds.
4           They lied to the Surgeon General.  All
5      right?  The person who is looking out for
6      public health.
7           And this is their confession, okay?  This
8      is a confession.  Our basic --
9           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
10           THE COURT:  Overruled.
11           MR. ROSEN:  This is an internal Tobacco
12      Institute document, and you heard that all of
13      these executives were the heads of the Tobacco
14      Institute.  They ran it.  They ran the show,
15      along with the lawyers.
16           Our basic position in the cigarette
17      controversy is subject to charge and may be
18      subject to the finding that we are making false
19      or misleading statements to promote the sale of
20      cigarettes.
21           They knew what they were doing, and they
22      forged ahead without any care in the world.
23      That is reckless.  That is conscious disregard
24      for human life.  That is what they chose to do.
25      That's what they chose to do. Vivian Wilkinson, she chose to try to quit
2      smoking a bunch of times and failed, not
3      knowing what they knew and not knowing what
4      they were doing.
5           Filters are frauds.  You saw the spike in
6      how much -- it started out, it was unfiltered
7      cigarettes, and then everybody was smoking
8      filters.  Today the market is almost
9      100 percent filtered cigarettes, and it all
10      happened when?  When was filtered cigarettes?
11           Well, look at that, right there in 1954.
12      Right when the health issue starts coming out,
13      when the mouse painting studies, right when the
14      Frank Statement comes out.  There could be
15      problems with smoking.  What did the cigarette
16      industry do?  More filters.  Let's get filters.
17      Let's give light cigarettes.  Let's give
18      low-tar cigarettes.  And they spiked.
19           It talks about how the industry has the
20      filtered market.  1963:  Here's our triple, our
21      quadruple, our quintuple filter, capable of
22      removing whatever constituents are in tobacco
23      smoke.
24           And they knew the smoker of a filtered
25      cigarette was getting as much or more nicotine and tar than they would have gotten from a
2      regular cigarette.
3           Do you think Vivian Wilkinson knew that?
4      Do you think that she knew when she switched to
5      a filter or light cigarette that every time she
6      took a puff, don't you think she's getting
7      something less, and they knew she was getting
8      more, more of the bad stuff.
9           Because it was an illusion of filtration.
10      I mean, they knew it.  All of these documents,
11      all of these companies knew it.
12           The person who switches from a high
13      filtration cigarette winds up smoking more
14      units in order to provide themselves the same
15      delivery that they had before.
16           I asked this question of Dr. Barnett:
17           It was reported Vivian Wilkinson switched
18      to filters because she thought they were safer?
19      There was somebody that reported that?
20           Yes.
21           There was also reports that Vivian
22      Wilkinson switched to light cigarettes, tried
23      light cigarettes in the 1980s, because she felt
24      they were safer?
25           Yes. She relied, she believed, and they
2      capitalized on it.  Not just her, but millions
3      and millions of people who all switched to
4      light cigarettes under this false impression
5      that it was actually going to help them.
6           And all the while, happily for us,
7      nicotine is both habituating and unique.
8           This is an RJ Reynolds document.  You
9      heard about Claude Teague.  You will see
10      Claude's Teague name.  He rose through the
11      ranks of RJ Reynolds:
12           Happily for us, nicotine is both
13      habituating.
14           I mean, they're boasting about it.
15           The nicotine levels are not obtained by
16      accident.  We can regulate nicotine fairly
17      precisely.
18           Did you remember Dr. Cummings taking about
19      taking all of the nicotine out, they can take
20      it out; they put it back in, perfectly
21      controlling precisely the amount of nicotine in
22      every one of their cigarettes, uniform dosage
23      form?
24           Any level management might require.  It
25      talks about pH levels.  Smoke pH increases an increased proportion.  Total nicotine occurs in
2      the free form.
3           I mean, they studied it.  They knew it.
4      And this is how they designed their cigarettes,
5      so people keep smoking and can't put them down.
6           And what happens when their scientists --
7      when there are scientists that are trying to
8      help the public?  This was a doctor who was
9      studying to find an antagonist for nicotine.
10           That means that if you take a drug and it
11      blocks your nicotine receptors, right, so you
12      are not going to want to smoke, right?
13           What do they do?  If it goes forward, we
14      are in the process of digging our own grave,
15      right?
16           Their goal would have the potential of
17      putting the tobacco manufacturers out of
18      business.
19           From the Plaza Hotel up until 1994, well,
20      really until 2000, these folks, this industry,
21      this company, this corporation lied, deceived,
22      in an unspeakable, unthinkable manner.
23           And that's what we're talking about,
24      punitive damages.  This was how much money they
25      spent on their marketing and their campaign, right?  How much money I read to you.  I stood
2      up and I think I read to you some requests for
3      admissions, about how much they are paying the
4      TI and the Tobacco Research Committee, each
5      company, millions and millions of dollars.
6           The tobacco industry spent more on
7      advertising cigarettes in one day than the
8      government could spend in a year.  They were
9      outspending everybody.
10           They want you to think that everybody
11      knew, everybody believed that cigarettes --
12           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
13           THE COURT:  Sustained.
14           MR. ROSEN:  1964, the Surgeon General --
15           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike, your Honor.
16           THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
17      last comment.
18           Counsel, talk about the evidence.
19           MR. ROSEN:  Yes, your Honor, sorry.
20           1964, the Surgeon General Report comes
21      out.  Everyone -- everyone knows that cigarette
22      smoking is deadly, right?
23           In all of the other reports, it is all out
24      there, everyone knows.  Everyone is just
25      choosing to smoke.  All right? Holding strategy.  The billions and
2      billions of dollars worked.  And this graph
3      shows and proves it, okay?  This graph doesn't
4      lie.  This graph doesn't lie.
5           What they did worked, and it affected
6      countless, countless people, with a level of,
7      you know, untold harm and suffering.
8           There it is.  I knew it was somewhere.
9           I mean, it's right there.  You see, it
10      keeps spiking.  Even after whatever report came
11      out, whatever the government is trying to
12      convey, their message was much, much stronger.
13           And they had to lie about addiction.  They
14      had to keep it secret, because they knew that
15      addiction was key to their argument that
16      smokers just choose to smoke.  It is their
17      choice.  It is their free will.  They enjoy it.
18      That is their choice.
19           They knew that they can't defend continued
20      smoking as free choice if the person is
21      addicted.
22 23           "QUESTION:  Throughout your tenure with
24      American, it was not only American's position,
25      but your position that cigarettes weren't injurious to health; is that accurate?
2           "ANSWER:  Through my tenure?
3           "QUESTION:  Yes.
4           "ANSWER:  Yes, that is so.
5           "QUESTION:  That is something that
6      American Tobacco wants the public to believe;
7      is that correct?
8           "ANSWER:  Yes.
9           "QUESTION:  It's a statement that the
10      American Tobacco put great reliance on?
11           "ANSWER:  We issued that statement, yes.
12      Certainly, we wanted them to believe it.
13           "QUESTION:  As far as you you're
14      concerned, a person is justified in relying on
15      that statement?
16           "ANSWER:  Yes."
17           (The video clip ended.)
18           MR. ROSEN:  People, according to the
19      tobacco, the head CEO, this was in the 1980s,
20      were justified in relying on what they were
21      saying:  Cigarette smoking is not injurious to
22      health.
23           That's what he said.
24           There is an instruction -- this was the
25      CEO of American Tobacco Company.  I want to make very, very clear, okay, that RJ Reynolds
2      is responsible for the harms of American
3      Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson.  They
4      are responsible.  They are part of RJ Reynolds
5      now.  All right?  And that is an instruction
6      that you are going to get.
7           And so did she rely on their fraud?  Did
8      it work?  Did it have an impact on Vivian?
9           Yes.
10           Did she rely on their conspiracy to
11      conceal about filtered cigarettes and whether
12      they were safe or whether they were unsafe?
13           Yes.
14           State whether you find -- and this is the
15      question on whether punitive damages are
16      warranted in this case.
17           And I know I told you we're close to the
18      end, we're close to the end, all right?  I told
19      you we're ahead of schedule.  I saw some you,
20      your faces kind of lit up a little bit.  We are
21      ahead of schedule.
22           If you answer "yes" to this question, we
23      are going to have a very short second phase,
24      probably come back tomorrow, but it will be
25      very short, and I promise you, my intent, I'm going to play a video that is probably less
2      than half an hour long.
3           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
4           THE COURT:  Sustained.
5           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike again.
6           THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
7      last comment.  It is stricken.
8           MR. ROSEN:  If you answer "yes," it's a
9      short second phase of trial, just on the issue
10      of punitive damages, okay?
11           We protect kids.  We protect children.  We
12      don't addict them, all right?  And RJ Reynolds
13      is treated just like a person.  A corporation
14      is treated like a person.
15           They targeted kids.  Vivian Wilkinson was
16      13 years old when she started smoking.  She was
17      exactly who they were looking for, and she was
18      their perfect customer.
19 20           >>:  Cigarettes manufactures are not
21      interested in obtaining new business from
22      teenagers in our society.
23           >>:  But how can you stay in business if
24      you can't hook the kids?
25           >>:  We've been in business very well, thank you, for some time now without attempting
2      to hook kids.  We do everything possible to
3      discourage teenage smoking.
4           (The video clip ended.)
5           MR. ROSEN:  I mean, the lies don't stop.
6      They don't end.  They have targeted kids, and
7      it started back in the '20s, and we have the
8      documents.  They were running around the
9      schools, big business.  Line up the most
10      popular students.  Get these kids started
11      early, because they knew that smokers don't
12      start smoking over the age of essentially 25,
13      and I think 80 to 90 percent under 18 is when
14      they start smoking.  That's when people start
15      smoking.  You don't see people start smoking at
16      30, 35.  They've got to get the children.
17           And they studied them.  They stalked these
18      kids.
19           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
20           THE COURT:  Sustained.
21           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike.
22           THE COURT:  The jury will disregard the
23      last comment.
24           MR. ROSEN:  High school students,
25      freshman, sophomores, juniors, seniors in high school.  That's how they create addiction.
2           You heard Dr. Cummings.  You heard
3      Dr. Drobes talk about how the kids' brains are
4      actually developing, the frontal lobe; how it
5      actually affects and changes the kids' frontal
6      lobes growing up.  That's the part of the brain
7      that deals with impulse.
8           They studied the 14- to 20-year-old market
9      in hopes to discover the secret of the instant
10      popularity.  Creating a fad in this market
11      could be a bonanza.
12           That's what they wanted, a bonanza.  This
13      huge business opportunity for RJ Reynolds and
14      the other companies.
15           This is an RJ Reynolds document.  In 1960,
16      the young adult market, the 14- to 24-year-old
17      age group, they represent tomorrow's cigarette
18      business.  The 14-year-old kids.  She was 13.
19      She was right in their sweet spot.  They got
20      her a little bit early.
21           Right here.  I mean, this they studied how
22      to induce a presmoker, right?  We need to
23      consider another aspect of the business.
24      That's the factors which induce a presmoker.
25           He does not start -- he does not start to smoke to satisfy a non-existent craving for
2      nicotine.  People don't start smoking for
3      nicotine, right?  They see other people, they
4      see advertisements, they see it's cool, it's
5      normal, it's risky, right?  It's rebellious.
6           But once they start, they can't stop.  It
7      changes to that, to craving for nicotine.
8           Why do you think they spent the amount of
9      money on all of the advertising, all of the
10      television shows, and the Flintstones and Lucy
11      and all of the other shows?
12           Because that had no effect on anybody,
13      right?  All of the advertising, all of the
14      marketing, that didn't have any effect on
15      anybody.  We don't want anybody to start
16      smoking our product.
17           Realistically -- this is RJ Reynolds, some
18      thoughts about the new brands of the cigarette
19      market:  Realistically, if our company is to
20      survive over the long-term, we must gain our
21      share of the youth market.
22           Fourteen to 24.  We need to increase
23      penetration among the 14- to 24-year-olds.
24      That's 1975.
25           This is what they sent.  They sent this letter in 1990, all the way in 1990.  Some kids
2      contact RJ Reynolds, and what do they write?
3           Despite all of the research going on, the
4      simple and unfortunate fact, scientists do not
5      know the case or causes of chronic diseases
6      reported.  We would appreciate your passing
7      this information.
8           Pass this along to the kids.  Let them
9      know.  To date, science hasn't proven it is
10      harmful.  Go ahead and smoke.
11           And what about nicotine?  You know,
12      nicotine, everybody knew that nicotine is
13      addictive, right?  Everyone knew about that.
14           They deliberately downplayed the role of
15      nicotine.  They deliberately downplayed it,
16      right?
17           So people don't know that's the reason why
18      they have to smoke 20 or 30 or 40 cigarettes a
19      day, day in and day out, for decades.
20           Youth market.  Twelve-year-olds.  Young
21      adult smokers.  Replacement smokers.  A
22      replacement smoker, because people die, and
23      they need to replace that person with a kid.
24      With a fresh crop.
25           Vivian Wilkinson was a replacement smoker. All right?  She replaced the people that died
2      on the other end.  And they knew it, and that's
3      what they wanted.  And that's who they
4      targeted.
5           There is going to be another issue:
6      Percentage of fault you get to decide, okay?
7      You get to decide relative fault on the
8      parties.  You can decide if Vivian Wilkinson
9      had fault.  Maybe she didn't try hard enough to
10      quit.  Maybe she shouldn't smoke after she got
11      COPD.  You make that decision.  All right?
12           But when you make that decision, look at
13      everything in context.  All right?  And the way
14      I say you look at this, if two people come to
15      the table, Vivian Wilkinson comes down and sits
16      at the table, RJ Reynolds sits down at the
17      table, who has more information?  Who has more
18      knowledge?  Who knows what is going on with
19      these cigarettes and what they were doing?
20           So I would suggest to you, I'm just going
21      to put a number, RJ Reynolds, 90 percent;
22      Vivian Wilkinson, 10 percent.
23           And you can change that.  That's up to
24      you.  This is your decision, okay?  Your
25      decision. THE COURT:  You have 10 minutes, Counsel.
2           MR. ROSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.
3           Corporations cannot conduct themselves in
4      the way RJ Reynolds and these other companies
5      did.  They can't do it.  You can't conceal.
6      You can't commit fraud.  You can't cause death.
7           If you do, you are responsible for those
8      harms.  They are responsible for the harms they
9      caused.  Okay?
10           And this, the harm that this company
11      caused, this family is the highest level of
12      harm.  It doesn't get more than this.  Okay?
13           Families destroyed.  This family
14      destroyed.  They were a happy family, and
15      Vivian Wilkinson worked hard, and she raised
16      her kids, and she did her best, and she did a
17      good job.  She did a good job.
18           And so you're going to have to decide, and
19      I'm going to ask you, and I'm going to suggest
20      to you a number.  I want to explain this.  The
21      number is a suggestion.  You can go higher or
22      you can go lower.  It's up to you.  You make
23      the decision, and Vivian and her family will
24      respect whatever decision you make, okay?
25           I want to start with William Wilkinson.  I want to start with No. 2, okay?  No. 8, excuse
2      me.
3           This gentleman took the stand, and he
4      shared with you his feelings, and they were
5      significant, and for a man who is a man like
6      him, a soldier, a war veteran, okay?  I'm sure
7      it wasn't easy.  I know you saw it.
8           And it was serious, and it was deep, and
9      it was right into the soul of this man.  And I
10      would suggest to you that he lost someone very,
11      very dear.  If you were to take that pain that
12      this man has and spread it over a 700 man
13      squadron --
14           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
15           THE COURT:  Sustained.
16           MR. ROSEN:  If you were to take that pain,
17      you wouldn't see a single smiling face, okay?
18      You wouldn't see a --
19           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
20           THE COURT:  I sustained the objection
21      previously, Counsel.
22           MR. ROSEN:  You will decide the level of
23      harm.  Vivian Turner, she lost her best friend.
24      That's what she said.
25           And she watched and she was there.  You have the medical records.  You are going to see
2      the last days, the last months, the last years,
3      two years, you will see two years, Vivian
4      Wilkinson in and out of the hospital with COPD.
5           End-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary
6      disease is devastating.  It is devastating.
7      People can't breathe.  They are on oxygen.  It
8      is -- it is a slow way of suffocating, and she
9      saw it, and she was there with her best friend.
10           You decide how significant that is.  And I
11      suggest to you that level of harm is
12      overwhelming.  And so I'm going to suggest to
13      you these numbers, and they are just
14      suggestions.  You make a decision whether you
15      want to go higher or lower.  It is up to you.
16           All right.  But I would suggest for each,
17      for Vivian Wilkinson and Eugene Wilkinson, I
18      would suggest $2 million each.
19           Punitive damages.  That's going to be that
20      last question.  It is to punish and deter
21      companies from doing similar conduct.  It is so
22      that other corporations, not just RJ Reynolds,
23      it is to punish RJ Reynolds, but to let other
24      companies know this is not the way we do
25      business.  We don't accept this in our country. And so you decide whether we have met our
2      burden that they have risen to being guilty of
3      intentional misconduct, whether we proved that
4      by clear and convincing evidence.
5           And you have all of the documents, and I
6      don't think it would be any more clear or
7      convincing --
8           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection as to "I don't
9      think."
10           THE COURT:  Sustained.  No personal.
11           MR. ROSEN:  It can't be any more clear and
12      convincing than those documents.  You take a
13      look at them and you decide.
14           They stood before Congress.  This was a
15      year after Vivian Wilkinson was diagnosed with
16      the disease that killed her.
17 18           >>:  Placed under oath, do you or do not
19      agree with the Surgeon General's testament of
20      over 400,000 smokers died?
21           >>:  I do not agree.
22           >>:  Do you know how many die each year?
23           >>:  I do not know.
24           MR. ROSEN:  It's RJ Reynolds right there.
25           >>:  They agreed that smoking causes lung cancer.  Do you agree?
2           >>:  It may.
3           >>:  Do you know whether it does?
4           >>:  I do not.
5           >>:  The medical experts agree that
6      smoking causes emphysema.  Do you agree?
7           >>:  It may.
8           >>:  They agree that smoking causes
9      bladder cancer, stroke and low birth weight.
10      Do you agree?
11           >>:  It may.
12           >>:  Mr. Tisch, I want to move to you for
13      a moment.  In a deposition last year you were
14      asked whether smoking causes cancer.
15           Your answer was, "I don't believe so."
16           Do you stand by that answer today?
17           >>:  I do, sir.
18           >>:  You are head of a manufacturer of a
19      product that's been accused by the overwhelming
20      scientific community to cause cancer.
21           You don't know?  You don't have an
22      interest in finding out?
23           >>:  I do, sir, yes.
24           >>:  And what have you done to pursue that
25      interest? >>:  Well, we have looked at the data, and
2      the data that we have been able to see has all
3      been statistical data that has not convinced me
4      that smoking causes death.
5           >>:  Mr. Campbell, you were also deposed,
6      and you said, "To my knowledge, it has not been
7      proven that cigarette smoking causes cancer."
8           Will you ever be convinced, and what
9      evidence are you waiting for?
10           >>:  Let's have the microphone passed
11      over.
12           >>:  Yes, I may be convinced.  We don't
13      know what causes cancer in general right now,
14      so I think that we may find out what causes
15      cancer, and we may find out some relationship
16      which has yet to be proven.
17           >>:  Let me begin my questioning on the
18      matter of whether or not nicotine is addictive.
19      Let me ask you first, and I would like to just
20      go down the row, whether each of you believes
21      that nicotine is not addictive.
22           I heard virtually all of you touch on it.
23      Just yes or no.
24           Do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
25           >>:  I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.
2           >>:  Mr. Johnston.
3           >>:  Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine
4      clearly do not meet the classic definitions of
5      addiction.  There is no intoxication.
6           >>:  We'll take that as a no.  Again, time
7      is short.  If you can just -- I think each of
8      you believe nicotine is not addictive.  We
9      would like to have it for the record.
10           >>:  I don't believe that nicotine or our
11      products are addictive.
12           >>:  I believe nicotine is not addictive.
13           >>:  I believe that nicotine is not
14      addictive.
15           >>:  I believe that nicotine is not
16      addictive.
17           >>:  And I, too, believe that nicotine is
18      not addictive.
19           (The video clip ended.)
20           MR. ROSEN:  Are punitive damages warranted
21      in this case?  What they did?  What these
22      companies did?  It screams punitive damages.
23      So I would suggest you answer "yes."
24           It is a lot.  I really truly, on behalf of
25      everyone here, thank you so much for your time. I understand it was a true sacrifice.  Thank
2      you.


15           MR. ROSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.  May it
16      please the Court.
17           So now this is my last opportunity, okay?
18      I'm sorry, I just keep coming back up.  This is
19      it, okay?  From there, you don't have to listen
20      to me.  You are going to go back into the back
21      and decide the outcome of this case.
22           There is a saying that I heard before, and
23      I think it's appropriate and I want to discuss
24      it:  Many are called upon, but few are chosen.
25           Okay.  There was a very large roomful of people here when we started jury selection, and
2      it came down to you, you folks.
3           And one of the primary reasons is because
4      each of you showed that you can be fair and
5      impartial jurors in this case.  All right?
6           And I think that you heard other jurors
7      say how they think these cases are frivolous,
8      people shouldn't have a right to bring these
9      lawsuits, and I would suggest to you that you
10      can take that same impartiality into
11      consideration when you look at some of the
12      people's testimony in this case.
13           Barbara Walsh.  All right.  She talked
14      about willfully, enjoyably, and I believe it's
15      frivolous.
16           All right.  When she testified, I asked
17      her:  How do you feel about these lawsuits?
18           She said:  Angry that it would take 15, 16
19      years.  I'm not too sure as when Vivian passed
20      away.  It would take that long for her daughter
21      to try to collect money for something her
22      mother willfully and enjoyably, and I believe
23      it's frivolous.  It's a waste of everyone's
24      time and energy, mine included.
25           And she said:  These lawsuits are frivolous and ludicrous.
2           You know, that's not impartiality.  That
3      is not impartiality.  She's an independent
4      witness.  Okay?  But she did come in -- she
5      testified in this case with partiality.
6           And the most -- the best evidence in this
7      case regarding Vivian Wilkinson's health back
8      then are the medical records.  Those are
9      medical records from back in 1993.
10           They are documented.  They were documented
11      back then, and they are not testimony from
12      someone, from Barbara Walsh 20 years later or
13      30 years later.  Okay?
14           And so this was -- this was the most
15      important thing.
16           Can you bring up the admission note, the
17      note from Baptist Hospital, please?
18           And counsel brought this up.  There is a
19      note that talked about doxycycline, and we
20      heard about that.  It's a prescription
21      medication.  It's a prescription medication,
22      and she reported it when she went to the
23      doctor.  All right?
24           What didn't she report?  There is no
25      report about using inhalers.  I mean, she went to the doctor, and she couldn't breathe, and
2      she was asked, what are you taking, and she
3      said doxycycline.  But she doesn't say, I'm
4      taking Proventil.  She didn't say, I'm taking
5      some type of inhaler back then, before that
6      time.  She wasn't.  She wasn't.
7           Maybe she had used an inhaler at some
8      point in time before, but at the time of this
9      visit, she wasn't using any type of inhaler.
10           And you know what else this tells us?  It
11      tells us that she saw a doctor.  She got a
12      prescription medication.  Presumably, if she
13      saw a doctor, right?  Wouldn't that doctor --
14      she said she --
15           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor,
16      speculation.
17           THE COURT:  This is argument.  Overruled.
18           MR. ROSEN:  She should have gone to a
19      doctor earlier, right?  She should have gone to
20      a doctor earlier.
21           If she did, they would have done either a
22      PFT, pulmonary function test, and they would
23      have found what she had, or they would have
24      referred her to a pulmonary doctor, and they
25      would have done it. We have evidence that she saw someone, and
2      before she visits in April of 1993, when she
3      goes to the doctor, they ask her, do you have
4      any type of illnesses, issues, diseases, and
5      she says none, no diseases, nothing.  All
6      right?
7           And she reports no history, no other prior
8      history.  She talks about a car accident,
9      right?  She's hospitalized for a car accident
10      at some point before this visit.  All right?
11           If she had a car accident and she was
12      hospitalized, they would have examined her.
13      They would have looked at and would have
14      checked her out.  And you know what?  They
15      didn't diagnose her.
16           So we have evidence of visits before this.
17      So everything they are telling us -- if she had
18      gone to a doctor, right, that's their argument.
19           And so if someone says, Well, she should
20      have gone to a doctor, you can let them know.
21           She did go to a doctor, right?  She did go
22      to a doctor, and they didn't diagnose her with
23      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  That's
24      what this record reflects, a record from the --
25      from back then. This is also important.  This is a video.
2      Barbara Walsh was asked by defense counsel,
3      back in 1983:  Did you connect her shortness of
4      breath with her smoking?
5           And what did she say?
6           Can you play that video, 116?
7 8           "QUESTION:  In your own mind connect her
9      shortness of breath with her smoking?
10           "ANSWER:  Not really, no.
11           "QUESTION:  Ms. Wilkinson ever do or say
12      anything that indicated to you that she was
13      aware that smoking could cause damage to your
14      health?
15           "ANSWER:  I don't think we ever had a
16      conversation regarding that."
17           (The video clip ended.)
18           MR. ROSEN:  She never made a connection.
19      The person who's testifying about inhalers, she
20      never made the connection that her shortness of
21      breath equals -- was caused by smoking, and the
22      defense is arguing, well, Vivian Wilkinson
23      should have.
24           And then this, you know, this is also,
25      this is also important, 117.  I asked her: Sitting here today, do you believe that
2      smoking is harmful to you?
3           I'm not concerned about it, so I guess
4      that has to be a no.
5           You know, Barbara Walsh talked about
6      willfully, enjoyably.  She talked about the
7      daughter waiting 16 years to collect money.
8           She knew nothing about this case or the
9      history, that this started back in 1994, or the
10      history from 1953 going forward.  She knows
11      nothing about it.
12           And she's judging it, she's judging it
13      without any basis.  And so to say that Vivian
14      Wilkinson willfully and it was enjoyable,
15      Barbara Walsh still thinks that.
16           And, you know, you almost have to kind of
17      feel bad because she testified she's a smoker.
18      She's still smoking.
19           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
20           THE COURT:  Sustained.
21           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike.
22           THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
23      last comment.
24           MR. ROSEN:  We talked about -- counsel
25      talked about Dr. Barnett.  She admitted 23 million Americans are addicted.  She said
2      half of daily -- half of the daily smokers are
3      addicted.  That was her testimony, right?
4           Then why not, in 50 percent of the cases
5      she testified in, is the smoker addicted?
6           Isn't that strange, that she says
7      50 percent, if you're a regular daily smoker,
8      50 percent of those people are going to be
9      addicted, but the cases that she's hired by
10      lawyers in these cases and she testifies, none
11      of them are addicted.  None of them, by her own
12      statistics, you know.
13           And then they are saying, listen, she's
14      the only psychiatrist, she's the only person,
15      right?
16           You know, people don't -- she admitted
17      people don't go to her for nicotine addiction.
18      They go to her for other issues, bipolar or
19      they have some other drug abuse problem.  The
20      nicotine addiction is secondary for her.  No
21      one goes to her.  I think she said one out of
22      thousands of people, right?
23           People who have addictions to cigarettes,
24      they get help from either their primary care
25      physician, because they go in and have an issue, or they go to a doctor like Dr. Reed, a
2      pulmonologist, and they can't breathe anymore.
3           Dr. Reed says you have to stop smoking;
4      here is some medication; here are the things.
5      Those are the people on the front line:
6      Primary care doctors, the pulmonologists, the
7      people who are taking care of these people
8      getting diseases.  By the time they are getting
9      this help, it's too late.  It's too late.
10           By the time Vivian Wilkinson got that
11      patch in 1993, it was too late.
12           Dr. Gidel.  I want to talk a little bit
13      more about the statute of limitations.
14      Dr. Gidel, he was the person that was treating
15      her.
16           Let's bring up 114.
17           This was question concerning the pulmonary
18      function test and whether or not before 1990 it
19      would be mild, moderate, severe.
20           The next question:  Could you say with any
21      degree of certainty whether she had COPD?
22           Well, she may or may not have had
23      symptoms.
24           If you had done a pulmonary function test
25      prior to 1990, she probably would show some changes, right?
2           Okay.  And the question is:  "You don't
3      know if that would be mild or not?"
4           "ANSWER:  I don't know if it would be
5      mild, moderate or severe at that point, no.
6           That is the doctor that was taking care of
7      her.
8           Let's talk about -- talk about these
9      people, right?  Her father.  This is a person
10      who influences her.  He was a smoker.  That was
11      the testimony.  He was smoking, and you
12      think -- really, how bad do you think he
13      thought cigarette smoking was when he gives his
14      son, his own boy, a pack of cigarettes to smoke
15      until he gets sick?  Right?  He's a smoker.
16           Her sister, Happy, Josephine's testimony,
17      she was a smoker.  Those are the influences.
18           Mr. Malloy was brought up, right?  About
19      what he -- what he talked about and how he
20      warned, Mr. Malloy warned Vivian about the
21      health risks of smoking.
22           Let's see if we can find this.  No. 127.
23           "Did you ever hear any of Ms. Wilkinson's
24      siblings warn her about smoking?
25           "ANSWER:  No, not to my knowledge. "QUESTION:  Did any member of your family
2      warn Ms. Wilkinson?
3           "ANSWER:  Not to my knowledge."
4           That is the ex-husband.
5           Dr. Farber, 126.  This is their doctor:
6           "You agree, sir, that COPD is frequently
7      underdiagnosed clinically, true?
8           "ANSWER:  That is probably true, yes."
9           All right.  Vivian Wilkinson might have
10      seen a doctor.  We have records that show she
11      had to have seen somebody for a car accident to
12      get that doxycycline, right?  It's
13      underdiagnosed.
14           They can't meet their burden.  She would
15      have gone -- she should have gone to a doctor,
16      and this doctor would have somehow done the
17      pulmonary function test and told her, you have
18      COPD and it is caused by smoking.
19           It is the farthest stretch.
20           Joseph Wicks, right?  Joseph Wicks.  You
21      know, sometimes you have to fact-check.  That
22      is what my job is, fact-check.  I'm
23      listening --
24           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
25           MR. ROSEN:  -- listening to counsel. THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           MR. ROSEN:  You heard counsel bring up
3      that it was -- she was in her 40s when she had
4      breathing problems.  I think that's what
5      counsel said.
6           128, please.
7           "When you say 48, 49, 50, are you
8      referring to Vivian's age?  Was that she got
9      into her late 40s and 50s?
10           "No.  Years, years.
11           "You think she started coughing from
12      smoking late 1940s?
13           "Yeah."
14           Next slide.  119.
15           And this is my question to him:
16           "I want to clarify because earlier you
17      were asked about Vivian's health.
18           "Yes.
19           "Okay.  You said first noticed her having
20      shortness of breath in the '40s?
21           "Yes.
22           "In the '40s, Vivian was 17 or 18?
23           "No, it wasn't the '40s.  He was talking
24      about the years, the 40s.
25           "And so to clarify for the record, the first time you observed Vivian's shortness of
2      breath was after Reed was born, right?"
3           What does he say?  "Yes."
4           Let's see the video, 115.
5           Now, this is what he said, and this is
6      what he talked when the symptoms came and when
7      he had conversations with Vivian about it.
8 9           "QUESTION:  You have two grandchildren?
10           "ANSWER:  Yes.
11           "QUESTION:  What are their names?
12           "ANSWER:  David Joseph and Reed, Thomas
13      Reed.
14           "QUESTION:  And David Joseph was born in
15      1988?
16           "ANSWER:  Yes.
17           "QUESTION:  And Thomas Reed was born in
18      1990?
19           "ANSWER:  Yes, two years later.
20           "QUESTION:  Was Reed a little boy the
21      first time you observed your sister Vivian
22      having health problems?
23           "ANSWER:  He was smaller.  I don't know
24      how old he was then.
25           "QUESTION:  Before Reed was born, how was Vivian's health?
2           "ANSWER:  I think her health was all right
3      before he was born.
4           "QUESTION:  Before Reed was born?
5           "ANSWER:  Yes.
6           "QUESTION:  Based on your observations,
7      she was in good health?
8           "ANSWER:  Yes.
9           "QUESTION:  To clarify for the record, was
10      the first time you observed Vivian having
11      shortness of breath after Reed was born?
12           "ANSWER:  Yes, yes.
13           "QUESTION:  And was the first time you
14      observed Vivian having a smoker's cough, was
15      that after Reed was born?
16           "ANSWER:  Yes."
17           (The video clip ended.)
18           MR. ROSEN:  That is testimony.  She wasn't
19      in her 40s.  I was very clear.  We talked very
20      clearly about the 1990s, when Reed was born.
21      That was an anchoring time that he was able to
22      remember.  Ninety-one years old.
23           THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Counsel, slow
24      down.
25           MR. ROSEN:  Sorry about that.  She's typing furiously.  Thank you.
2           THE COURT:  I see steam coming out of the
3      court reporter's ears.
4           MR. ROSEN:  Dr. Farber, I asked him about
5      symptoms of COPD, 128.  It might be 123.  123.
6           "There a lot of different symptoms
7      associated?
8           "Yes.
9           "Cough?
10           "Yes.
11           "Wheezing?
12           "Yes.
13           "Sputum production?
14           "Yes."
15           She had none of those symptoms, that's
16      what every witness talked about, before 1990.
17      None of those symptoms.  None.  And she should
18      have gone to the doctor.
19           125.
20           "You agree that it's possible for someone
21      to have 50 percent lung function and a person
22      is still not showing symptoms?
23           "They may not, that is right."
24           That's their doctor.  Fifty percent.  She
25      was operating on 50 percent, and she may not have symptoms.
2           I asked Dr. Reed about inhalers for
3      treatment of asthma, wheezing.  It could be for
4      bronchitis, helping to bring up mucous, for
5      shortness of breath.  They may be anxious or
6      shortness of breath and other reasons, as well.
7           "Were there any inhalers that were
8      available over-the-counter in the '80s and the
9      '90s?
10           "Yes, there were inhalers available
11      over-the-counter.
12           "Can you explain to the jury, what are
13      some of the reasons people have shortness of
14      breath?
15           "Asthma, acute bronchitis, restrictive
16      lung disease, damage to the lung, lung trauma."
17           It goes on.  Many, many other things.
18           Just because she may have had shortness of
19      breath -- may have, okay, because I suggest to
20      you the record doesn't support that -- if she
21      did, it doesn't mean she had COPD.  You needed
22      to go to a doctor, and they would have said,
23      you have COPD.
24           You know, counsel brought up youth
25      marketing, right?  How does a youth marketing document in 1970 have anything to do with
2      Vivian Wilkinson, right?
3           PT 3400.
4           1984:  Younger adult strategies.  This is
5      RJ Reynolds.  How does it have to do with
6      Vivian Wilkinson, right?
7           The critical factor in the growth and
8      decline of every major brand over the last 50
9      years.  Okay?  She started smoking over the
10      last 50 years.
11           This goes back.  If you go from 1984 back
12      50 years, I think doing my math -- I'm not
13      going to get it right.  1933, '34.  That's what
14      it looks like.  That's why it's relevant,
15      because they were targeting her back then.
16           You know, I think Barbara Walsh did see
17      Vivian using inhalers --
18           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor, as
19      to what he thinks.
20           THE COURT:  Sustained.
21           MR. ROSEN:  More likely than not, it was
22      probably diagnosed after 1993, because she had
23      inhalers and she was --
24           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
25           MR. ROSEN:  That is what -- THE COURT:  Sustained.
2           Ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on
3      your own recollection of the evidence.
4           MR. ROSEN:  They are saying she was
5      negligent for not going to the doctor.  She was
6      negligent?  Their conduct was intentional and
7      calculated.
8           We already talked about the car accident,
9      the fact that she would have seen somebody, and
10      she never had a diagnosis.
11           Can you bring up -- just that.  Do you
12      have it?
13           1993.  What major illnesses have you had?
14           None.  None.
15           So if someone says that she was diagnosed
16      with something or she should have known she had
17      something, in 1993, when she asked, she thought
18      she had none.
19           She had health insurance.  That's the
20      testimony, she had health insurance.  And they
21      talked about alcohol.  She was able to stop
22      using alcohol, control her alcohol.  Do you
23      know what that shows?  You know, that shows
24      that she was able to stop alcohol, but she
25      could never stop using nicotine.  Right?  She was able to stop one thing, but she couldn't
2      stop the other.
3           You know, she had -- she had a second
4      chance, and she raised two beautiful kids.
5           How many chances did RJ Reynolds have?
6      How many chances did they have to change, to
7      make a difference, to make things right?
8           You know, they talked about there is no
9      proof of reliance, there is no proof that
10      concealment/reliance would have changed
11      anything.
12           You know, people have an instinct for
13      survival.  You make a decision whether all of
14      this information would have changed the way
15      Vivian Wilkinson looked at life and looked at
16      smoking.  Right?
17           About the flue-curing and the pH and the
18      bronchodilators and the flavoring and the
19      ventilation tricks and the ammoniation, and
20      everything else that they do to these
21      cigarettes.
22           You know, if she knew -- they talked about
23      everyone knew that nicotine was -- everyone
24      knew that nicotine was harmful, addictive,
25      right?  I think that's what counsel said, everyone knew.
2           PT 02077.  It's a Brown & Williamson
3      document.
4           Very few consumers -- this is what the
5      tobacco industry -- what year is this?
6           MR. PHILIPSON:  1978.
7           MR. ROSEN:  1978.  Very few consumers are
8      aware of the effect of nicotine, either its
9      addictive nature and nicotine is a poison.
10           Everyone knew?  Not true.  The industry
11      knew that the consuming public didn't know and
12      they relatively weren't aware.
13           1964.  Everybody knew, everybody knew that
14      nicotine was harmful.  You could stand on a
15      rooftop and yell it, and this was a major
16      event, and everyone is going to stop smoking.
17           PT 19233.  What is the industry saying?
18           "Propaganda blast was tremendous, and the
19      penetration of the public opinion widespread.
20      I have the feeling that the public reaction --
21      I have the feeling that the public reaction was
22      not as severe in order to have the emotional
23      depth that I feared."
24           The industry had no problem with it.  It
25      didn't have the impact.  And they capitalized on it.
2           You know, we heard about warning labels.
3      There was a warning label on all of the packs,
4      right?
5           PT 01040.
6           RJ Reynolds document.  Let's see what they
7      say about warning labels.
8           They looked at it as a plus.  They looked
9      at it as a plus because kids see a warning
10      label, they think it's dangerous, it's a little
11      risky, it's rebellious.  They looked at it as a
12      positive.
13           They talked about Dr. Cummings said that,
14      you know, in the 1970s and '80s, the public
15      health authorities were telling people to
16      switch to filters and light cigarettes.
17           Dr. Cummings' testimony, it was a major
18      mistake doing that.  They never would have done
19      it had they known.
20           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor,
21      motion.
22           THE COURT:  Sustained.
23           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike, please.
24           THE COURT:  Jury is to disregard.
25           MR. ROSEN:  Counsel, you know, I agree with one thing.  I agree with one thing.  Many
2      things said, but I agree with one thing:  Their
3      conduct was offensive.  All right?  And I think
4      Mr. Keehfus said Dr. Cummings showed some wrong
5      stuff, some bad stuff.
6           This isn't wrong stuff.  This isn't bad
7      stuff.  This is pure evil.  Pure evil.
8           Mitigating evidence.  Well, now they're
9      regulated.  In 2009, 2009, they are regulated.
10      Forty-five years it took for them to be
11      regulated.
12           And you know what?  This is what they said
13      about regulation.
14           PT 02009.
15           "I will be more cautious in using the
16      pharmacomedical model.  Do we really want to
17      tout cigarette smoke as a drug?  It is, of
18      course, but there are dangerous FDA
19      implications to having such conceptualization
20      go beyond these walls."
21           These companies didn't want to be
22      regulated, and it took 45 years.  And you know
23      what that is?  Mitigation?  Too little too
24      late.  Okay?  Because they weren't regulated
25      when Vivian Wilkinson was smoking. And then CTR.  They just put something
2      about the CTR.  They funded all research, all
3      of this great stuff.  Are they still saying
4      that CTR was a good thing?
5           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor.
6      Still.
7           THE COURT:  Thank you.
8           Counsel, just argue the facts, all right?
9           MR. ROSEN:  You have the evidence on what
10      CTR was and what they did.  Okay?  And who they
11      influenced.
12           This is who they were going after: the
13      public health, the schools, mass media, popular
14      culture, house rules, government, federal
15      agencies, regulatory agencies.
16           MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, your Honor,
17      motion in limine.
18           THE COURT:  Counsel, that is your board.
19      He's reading off of your board.  Overruled.
20           MR. ROSEN:  This is CTR.  This is who CTR
21      is.  It was an industry shield.  It was a
22      front.  That's what it is.  That's what CTR
23      was, and that is who they influenced, and they
24      spent millions and millions and millions of
25      dollars to shape public opinion. So that why?  That curve kept going up,
2      and people kept smoking.
3           Mitigation.  They've tried to make a safe
4      cigarette, right?  Spent all this money on
5      making a safe cigarette.
6           You know what testimony you heard?  RJ
7      Reynolds just merged with Lorillard.  They just
8      bought another company that sells the most
9      popular menthol, combustible, traditional
10      cigarette, Newport.  That's who they are today.
11      They're not trying to make a safer cigarette.
12           Their conduct is despicable.  And the
13      evidence is overwhelming.  They said to me
14      about the evidence overwhelming.  The evidence
15      is overwhelming in this case on behalf of
16      Plaintiff.  She was addicted to the cigarettes
17      containing nicotine.  It was a legal cause of
18      her COPD.  She died from it.  She suffered from
19      it.
20           Her family -- can you bring this up?
21           THE COURT:  Wrap this up, Counsel.
22           MR. ROSEN:  Wrapping it up.
23           It mattered.  It affects people in the
24      most profound way.
25           I truly appreciate your time.  Thank you.
