12          MR. ROSEN:  So it's Friday morning, and I
13    think this was the day I think we said that we
14    would end this, and -- and resolve this case.
15    And we made it.  And it was a --
16          I hope that it was an interesting road, I
17    hope that this was a positive experience for
18    each of you.
19          You know, I've watched -- we've watched
20    you come in and out of the courtroom, and it
21    seems like you're a tight-knit group, and maybe
22    there's some lasting friendships that will come
23    out of this jury service.
24          MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
25          THE COURT:  Sustained.   MR. ROSEN:  I can't thank you enough for
2    your time.  On behalf of Vivian and William, we
3    can't thank you enough.  And I know I've said
4    it a number of times, but thank you.
5          So this is the punitive damage phase of
6    this trial, the penalty phase, all right?  This
7    is the phase of the trial where you are going
8    to determine an amount, if any, to assess
9    against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for
10    punishment, okay?
11          And by your verdict --
12          The last question asked you, state
13    whether you found, by clear and convincing
14    evidence, whether punitive damages were
15    warranted.
16          And by your answer -- you said "yes" --
17    you found that this conduct, that the conduct
18    we presented, the conduct that caused Vivian
19    Wilkinson harm, rose to that level; all right?
20          And so now we're -- now we're going to
21    talk about what is -- what is an appropriate
22    amount to punish and also to let other
23    companies -- to deter other companies from
24    performing or committing or acting in similar
25    or same ways as R.J. Reynolds has, and to also let R.J. Reynolds know that they cannot act
2    this way; this kind of -- this kind of conduct
3    will not be tolerated.
4          And, so, you heard a little bit about
5    R.J. Reynolds being a changed company today,
6    and we're going to talk about that in a minute.
7    We're going to talk about Dr. Figlar and his
8    testimony, and whether they're a changed
9    company today.
10          That doesn't change 50 years of the most
11    heinous misconduct that, you know, any
12    corporation in this country could ever commit.
13    And so the amount of punitive damages --
14          You found, clear and convincing, that
15    it's warranted.  The amount is determined by
16    the greater weight of the evidence.
17          What's the greater weight of the
18    evidence?  What would be an amount that would
19    punish and deter R.J. Reynolds for their
20    conduct that caused Vivian Wilkinson harm?
21          You know, this is -- this is -- this was
22    a conspiracy that -- that was so vast and so
23    powerful, you know, that it affected so many --
24    so many lives, right?
25          In determining the amount, you can look at the reprehensibility of their conduct and
2    how it harmed other people in determining that,
3    okay; but you can only punish for the conduct
4    that caused her harm, Vivian Wilkinson harm.
5    But you can look at what they did to society in
6    general and to how it harmed other people.
7          It was the most -- it -- it rises to the
8    highest level, okay, because what they did and
9    what they do is for profit, all right?  It was
10    putting human life --
11          It was putting profit over human life,
12    all right?  It was -- it was -- they knew it
13    caused human suffering, and it was just about
14    money; okay?
15          And so when we talk about punitive
16    damages, punishment, which the purpose --
17          And I told you, it's not to compensate
18    Vivian Turner or William Wilkinson.  That's not
19    the purpose.  We're in a separate phase.  And
20    we talked about this in jury selection, that
21    this is a complete separate concept.  This is
22    meant to punish, okay, and deter.
23          And so when we look at that, putting
24    people's lives, you know, over -- you know,
25    putting profit over people's lives is the most significant and the most severe.
2          And -- and they talked about it in their
3    documents, that, you know, their basic
4    position -- I showed you this once before --
5    that they're making false and misleading
6    statements to -- to sell cigarettes, they were
7    subject to the charge and the finding.
8          They were charged, right?  Complaints
9    were filed.  The finding was made, all right?
10    And they knew what they were doing.
11          And so, today, today is the
12    accountability part, and we're going to talk
13    about an amount.  And what they did --
14          Again, it was -- it was -- they boasted
15    about it internally, how it was so brilliantly
16    conceived, this -- this design.
17          I want to talk about R.J. Reynolds today.
18    I want to talk about R.J. Reynolds today.
19          The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is the
20    defendant in this lawsuit.  And you heard a lot
21    about some other companies that are under the
22    Reynolds American, the parent company, the
23    holding company, right?  There's other
24    companies.  They're not corporations in this
25    courtroom, right?  They're not the ones --   You didn't hear anything about their
2    profitability, you didn't hear anything -- you
3    heard about the products that they made, and
4    we'll talk about that in a minute, but this
5    case is about R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's
6    conduct.
7          And let's talk about --
8          If you look -- just even if you look at
9    the other products that they're talking about,
10    right, which isn't R.J. Reynolds, but you look
11    at the products they're talking about, right,
12    what -- what did they say?
13          We cannot be comfortable selling a
14    product which most of our customers would stop
15    using if they could.  Right?
16          So, what is every single one of their
17    products that we're talking about, that
18    they're -- you know, they're reducing risk and
19    they're, you know, reducing harm?
20          Well, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco is this
21    (indicating).  This is just a cigarette where
22    they say it doesn't have additives; it has
23    menthol, apparently, in the -- in the filter,
24    right?
25          It's this organic, additive-free cigarette, which is highly addictive and
2    deadly, right?  That's the other product that
3    they're selling.
4          And then they talk about the American
5    Snuff Company.  That's just moist --
6          MR. HOHNBAUM:  Your Honor, objection.
7    May we approach?
8          THE COURT:  Sure.
9          (The following discussion was held at
10    sidebar:)
11          MR. HOHNBAUM:  He can't be making an
12    argument that selling a legal product is
13    somehow wrongful or the basis --
14          He can't be making an argument that just
15    selling a product -- and that's all we did,
16    we're selling a product, you know, it's
17    addictive, but that can't be a basis for a
18    punitive damages award, and that's what he just
19    basically told the jury.  And he can't do that.
20          MR. ROSEN:  They told the jury that
21    they're migrating the consumers --
22          THE COURT:  Keep your voice down.
23          MR. ROSEN:  Sorry about that.
24          THE COURT:  Go ahead.
25          MR. ROSEN:  Oh, I'm sorry.   THE COURT:  Just keep your voice down.
2          MR. ROSEN:  Sure.
3          They told the jury that they're migrating
4    these customers to these other deadly products,
5    which I'm going to tie in together, which is
6    not true, they're not migrating anybody.  Even
7    if they were, it's still this --
8          THE COURT:  The objection's overruled.
9         (The sidebar discussion was concluded and
10    the following was held in open court:)
11          MR. ROSEN:  And so the R.J. Reynolds
12    Tobacco Company of today is talking about
13    migrating their -- migrating their consumers,
14    and we're going to talk about whether that's
15    true or not for R.J. Reynolds.
16          But look -- I mean, look what they're
17    migrating to.  They're migrating to American
18    Snuff Company, which is just -- which is just a
19    moist smokeless tobacco.  It's addictive and it
20    causes mouth cancer.
21          Niconovum, it's just another addictive
22    gum, and I'm going to talk about that a little
23    bit later.  And then R.J. Reynolds Vapor.  I
24    mean, he admitted it's just a nicotine-delivery
25    device.   And what did he say?  He said, we don't
2    know what the long-term effects are going to
3    be.  I mean, sound familiar?
4          Punishment has to be significant.
5    Punishment has to be significant for it to be
6    meaningful.  It's -- it's the only legal way
7    for them to understand what they did was wrong,
8    all right?
9          The only thing they understand -- the
10    only thing they understand -- is money.  That's
11    the only thing this company will listen to.
12          And they told you that they respected
13    your verdict.  It's not that they need to
14    respect your verdict; it's that they need to
15    feel the verdict and they need to listen to it,
16    because that's the only way people -- that's
17    the only way companies or corporations that
18    commit this type of conduct will actually
19    change.
20          You know, historically, I mean, look --
21    look what they did with -- with documents.  You
22    know, I -- we showed you documents we have, but
23    we have evidence of what -- what did they do
24    with documents that -- that could have been
25    harmful to them.   You know, once it becomes clear that such
2    action is necessary, we will promptly remove --
3          MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
4          THE COURT:  What's the objection,
5    counsel?
6          MR. HOHNBAUM:  Misleading argument.
7          THE COURT:  Overruled.
8          MR. ROSEN:  We do not foresee any
9    difficulty in the event a decision is needed to
10    remove reports from research files.  You know,
11    once it becomes clear that such action is
12    necessary, we will promptly remove all such
13    reports from our files.
14          You know, we have what we have, but do we
15    have everything?
16          And this is -- this is what Dr. Figlar
17    was talking about.  You know, they have this
18    combustible product, right, that R.J. Reynolds
19    Tobacco Company, the defendant in this case,
20    that's what they manufacture.
21          And what do they talk about on their own
22    website?
23          You know, he came in here and he says,
24    well, we're going to -- we're trying to
25    migrate, we're transforming tobacco, we want people to do less risky products.  Is that
2    really --
3          Just think about it.  Is that really what
4    the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company --
5          With their growth brands, right?  They
6    just got Newport, the number one selling
7    menthol cigarette brand.  They have Camel,
8    Camel Crush.
9          Where did I put that?  It's somewhere
10    here.  I'll find it in a minute.
11          Camel Crush, Doral, all these other
12    cigarettes, that these are their growth brands,
13    okay?  R.J. Reynolds, they are growing their
14    tobacco business; they're not migrating
15    customers to -- to these other less risky
16    products.
17          What happens if -- what happens to their
18    profits if that actually happened?  What
19    happens if they send everybody over to the VUSE
20    and Snus?
21          And you're going to hear about the
22    profits --
23          You actually heard about it, and I'm
24    going to get to that in a minute, but what
25    happens to their profits, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
2          So do they -- what is --
3          Truly, what are they doing?  And you have
4    it in evidence.  They're growing.  They are
5    growing, they are expanding.
6          You know, and I asked Dr. Figlar, and I
7    just --
8          I wanted to know what he thought, you
9    know?  You know, give me some truth, all right?
10    We have the documents, we know what they say,
11    we know what they've said for decades.
12          You know, talking about moist smokeless
13    tobacco:  Is it a nicotine-delivery device?
14          No.  It's a tobacco product.
15          The cigarette, these Natural Spirits, is
16    it a nicotine-delivery device?
17          No.  It's a cigarette.
18          You know, just say the truth.  Tell the
19    truth.
20          We just talked about their growth brands.
21    And the market --
22          You know, Dr. Figlar came in here and he
23    talked about everything that's going on today;
24    and I'm going to show you the question and
25    answer that was asked by counsel about what's going on.  You know, are we going to rehash
2    things from the past, right?
3          Did he talk to you -- did he talk to you
4    at all about youth marketing, about how they
5    targeted kids, about what they're doing today,
6    right?  Because these are the -- this is the
7    modern --
8          MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor, no
9    evidence.
10          THE COURT:  Sustained.
11          MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike, please.
12          THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
13    last comment.
14          MR. ROSEN:  This is in evidence.  You
15    have -- you have this, right?  You have this in
16    evidence.  This is --
17          You have this in evidence.  You can take
18    a look, right?
19          This is -- this is one of their
20    cigarettes that they're marketing now, right,
21    with a little --
22          You see that little flavor bead?  And you
23    can take --
24          You know, you're going to have this in
25    evidence and, you know, you take this cigarette that they're marketing now and you --
2          It's a regular cigarette, and if you want
3    to get a burst of menthol flavor, there's a
4    little bead -- a flavor bead in the filter.
5    You pop it, right, and it gives this nice --
6    this menthol flavor, this taste; right?
7          And so what were they talking about, for
8    decades, about who --
9          I mean, who is this directed to?  Who is
10    this directed to?
11          Can I get that PT number?
12          TECHNICIAN:  1040.
13          MR. ROSEN:  This is PT1040, and it's in
14    evidence.  You have it back there.
15          MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
16    Can we approach?
17          THE COURT:  Sure.
18          (The following discussion was held at
19    sidebar:)
20          MR. HOHNBAUM:  Judge, he can't use Camel
21    Crush and then go back to a document in the
22    1970s and suggest that what we're doing with
23    Camel Crush is marketing to youth.
24          There's been absolutely no evidence in
25    this case since 2000 -- since -- pardon me, since the '70s and '80s, that we're studying or
2    marketing to youth.  So he can't say --
3          Nobody came in and said this was directed
4    to youth, that we've studied youth, that the
5    youth are the market for this product.
6          And for him to come in now and equate
7    that product with conduct that's back in the
8    '70s is completely misleading, and there's
9    simply no evidentiary foundation whatsoever for
10    him making that argument.
11          THE COURT:  Thank you.
12          Where are you going with this?
13          MR. ROSEN:  The document specifically
14    says that we need to come up with new and novel
15    filter ideas to sell to the youth market.  It's
16    in there.  That's in evidence.
17          THE COURT:  Anything else?
18          MR. ROSEN:  No.
19          THE COURT:  Sustained.
20         (The sidebar discussion was concluded and
21    the following was held in open court:)
22          MR. ROSEN:  I'm sorry.  I mean, you have
23    this advertisement in evidence.
24          And when we talk about -- about this VUSE
25    product and about Eclipse --   I mean, you have a document in evidence
2    from back in 19 --
3          Back in 1969, they were talking about
4    putting something like this together, right?
5    But they couldn't.  They never could.  They
6    wouldn't do it because they couldn't admit
7    something was wrong with the combustible
8    product.
9          I mean, 1969, you see it's exactly what
10    they're -- what they said they started doing
11    decades later, right?  Which was never
12    successful.
13          And if it wasn't successful, they would
14    take it off the market.  Eclipse didn't last
15    because they knew that the combustible
16    traditional cigarette was it.
17          And gum, you know, they talk about --
18    down here, they're talking about the chewable
19    product, gum consisting of tobacco flavors and
20    different forms of nicotine, partial free and
21    partial bound nicotine.  So now they have the
22    gum.
23          And so they have a product for every
24    single addict -- person addicted to nicotine.
25    Every single person, right?  I mean, let's go back to that continuum.
2          You know, you have someone who's addicted
3    to cigarettes, right, and then they go and they
4    try the gum.  If they don't make it, they're
5    back to the cigarettes.  If not, let's try
6    some -- let's try this.  And if it's not
7    sufficient enough, we'll go back to cigarettes.
8          Snus, I can sit at my desk with a pouch
9    and just swallow the nicotine juice all day
10    long, don't have to get up.
11          And so they knew what they were doing.
12    They knew.  And so when we're determining an
13    amount for punitive damages in this case, you
14    have to look at the nature -- and that's in the
15    jury instructions -- the nature, extent and
16    degree of misconduct; right?
17          And so where are we on the scale?
18    Because that's the only -- that's the only
19    issue that we have to talk about, where on the
20    scales of nature, extent and degree?
21          It's the worst nature, it's intentional.
22    This isn't someone who --
23          You know, when we talk about someone
24    being negligent, they see a red light or
25    they -- they don't see a red light, they're negligent, they run through the intersection
2    accidentally, it's a mistake, they were
3    negligent, right?  That's not this, okay?
4          If someone sees a red light and they see
5    a busy intersection and they run right through
6    that red light intentionally, that's what we're
7    talking about, intentional, the highest degree;
8    right?
9          Extent -- 50 years, the length -- the
10    extent of this misconduct, it's the highest
11    degree.  Highest on the scales.  Conduct --
12          And then the degree, conduct causing
13    suffering and death and putting profits
14    number one.  It's the most severe.
15          And, so, with your verdict, you need to
16    hear -- they need to hear it in Winston-Salem,
17    North Carolina.  They need to hear it in
18    "Tobaccoville," I think is what Dr. Figlar
19    called it.
20          And so I want to talk about Dr. Figlar.
21    Dr. Figlar came in and he talked all about
22    everything from today, what's going on today,
23    how they're regulated, the MSA, the FDA, which,
24    by the way, they were forced, right, they were
25    forced --   MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
2    Misstates the evidence.
3          THE COURT:  Sustained.
4          MR. ROSEN:  We'll talk about that in a
5    minute.
6          But are you going to -- are you going to
7    revisit those events?
8          No.
9          He's not going to talk about the history
10    and what they did.
11          You're going to talk about going forward.
12    That's what he's talking about, R.J. Reynolds
13    going forward, which you've already heard
14    about, but --
15          And I don't know if --
16          I think you remember -- I think you
17    remember, but this was long ago; this was two
18    weeks ago, after we did opening statements -- I
19    played a very, very long and boring video.  And
20    I apologize for that, but I played a video for
21    you.  It was that day.  And I don't know if you
22    remember -- maybe you do -- but that was
23    Dr. Figlar.  That was Dr. Figlar, right?
24          And this is what he said.  This is
25    R.J. Reynolds today. You know, if you ask him why wasn't he
2        talking about it here in the courtroom, because
3        this is what he has to say in 2014 about the
4        CTR.

8        Q.    ...in the last big paragraph there, if
9 you could read from "originally" and down one, two,
10 three, four, five, six, seven lines, if you could read
11 from "originally," seven lines down, to the word
12 "product," into the record, please.
13        A.    Okay.  Originally, CTR was organized as a
14 public relations effort.  The industry told the world
15 CTR would look at the diseases which were being
16 associated with smoking.  There was even a suggestion
17 by our political spokesman that if a harmful element
18 turned up, the industry would try to root it out.  The
19 research of CTR also discharged a legal
20 responsibility.  The manufacturer has a duty to know
21 its product.
22        Q.    Do you agree, though, Doctor, that the
23 manufacturer does have a duty to know its product?
24        A.    I do.
25        Q.    And do you agree that the industry never

1 told the world that the CTR was merely a public
2 relations effort?
3        A.    I don't know what they told them
4 necessarily with regard to public relations.  I don't
5 know what it was.
6        Q.    Okay.  You know that it was?
7        A.    I said I don't know that it was.
8        Q.    So, as the corporate representative with
9 the most knowledge from R.J. Reynolds, as you sit here
10 today, you still don't know whether or not the -- the
11 CTR was merely a public relations effort?
12        A.    I don't believe that it was.  I don't
13 think CTR was.  I think the Tobacco Institute in many
14 respects was, it was an advocacy group; but CTR, as a
15 grant-in-aid group, was not.
16        Q.    So, again, this is another industry
17 insider from back in the '70s who may be mistaken;
18 correct?
19        A.    Quite possibly.
20                (Video clip concluded.)
21              MR. ROSEN:  That's 2014.  And he's
22        saying, I don't believe that the CTR was a
23        public relations effort.  I mean, and he's
24        speaking as the corporate voice of R.J.
25        Reynolds Tobacco Company in this deposition. 2014, right?
2              These are the documents you have.  The
3        TIRC, which was the CTR, cannot, in my opinion,
4        provide the vehicle for such research.  It was
5        conceived as a public relations gesture and it
6        has functioned as a public relations operation,
7        right?
8              CTR, it's an industry shield, it acts as
9        a front, it's the cheapest insurance.  Right?
10              And he's still saying, well, I don't
11        think it was a public relations; I think it was
12        legitimate science.  I mean, that's 2014.
13              Let's play this.
14              (The video clip was played and taken down
15        to the best of the reporter's ability as
16        follows:)
17        Q.    Sir, do you think that the Tobacco
18 Institute, the CTR, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson
19 and American Tobacco and the industry was being honest
20 to the public when they were telling them, in the
21 1960s and '70s, that they didn't know that smoking
22 caused lung cancer?  Do you think those were honest,
23 forthright, and proper statements to be making?
24        A.    I think that those were the beliefs that
25 they held at the time and -- Q.    Sir --
2        A.    -- scientific -- I'm --
3        Q.    -- sir, sir, sir, no, no, no.  No, no.
4 I -- I understand those were their beliefs.
5              I want to know, do you believe that they
6 were being honest to the American public when they
7 were making those statements?
8        A.    If -- if I may answer the question, I
9 mean --
10        Q.    You can answer my question and then you
11 can expand on it as much as you want, like you've been
12 doing.
13              So, do you believe they were being
14 honest?
15        A.    At the time, they were, because that is
16 what they believed at that time.  Upon reflection,
17 today --
18        Q.    Okay.
19        A.    -- you would -- you would take a
20 different view, but you cannot look at it with today's
21 lens, in my opinion.
22                (Video clip concluded.)
23              MR. ROSEN:  I mean, he's saying, at that
24        time, when they were making those statements,
25        they were being honest; right? We have -- we have all the documents
2        about what they knew back then, and he has all
3        those documents, what they knew, and he still
4        won't admit it.  He still won't admit that
5        they --
6              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
7              THE COURT:  Sustained.
8              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike and motion.
9              THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
10        last comment.
11              MR. ROSEN:  That was his testimony in
12        2014.
13              Additives.  Additives.  This was -- you
14        know, I asked him about additives.  They put up
15        a whole slide that talked about ammonia and
16        different -- different additives.  There was
17        ammonia hydroxide, diammonium phosphate.  There
18        was a number of different things.  I think it
19        said cocoa and some other things.
20              You saw it, right?  They put it on their
21        website now.  It wasn't always on the website,
22        it wasn't always revealed to the public.  Now
23        it's there.
24              And I asked him:  Do you agree that the
25        additives you talked about, those are additives that are put into cigarettes to help people --
2        make it easier to inhale cigarettes?
3              No, I would not agree with that.
4              Right?  And so who's telling the truth,
5        right?
6              You heard evidence --
7              And this was Dr. Cummings, right?  You
8        heard evidence from -- from public health, from
9        someone who's dedicated his career to helping
10        people, right?
11              Doctor, are there chemicals that are
12        added to cigarettes that act as
13        bronchodilators?
14              Yeah.  Among the 600 or so additives that
15        are used in cigarettes, some of them -- cocoa
16        is an example, is an additive -- when burned,
17        has the effect of acting as a bronchodilator,
18        which actually -- actually opens the airways,
19        which counteracts the inflammatory response of
20        cigarette smoke, dilutes -- you know, dilates
21        the area.
22              And we have here ammonia hydroxide, brown
23        sugar, caramel, chocolate liquor, cocoa,
24        glycerol, honey.
25              What is propylene glycol? Well, it's an additive that affects the
2        harshness or irritation.  It makes it possible
3        to inhale particles into your airways, commonly
4        used in inhalers, for example, for medications.
5        But it's used in making cigarettes because they
6        are intended to be inhaled, right?
7              He couldn't even -- Dr. Figlar couldn't
8        even tell you that, the truth about the
9        additives.
10              What are ammonia compounds for?
11              This is Dr. Cummings.
12              Yes, ammonia is added in tobacco.  Not
13        all, but many cigarettes use ammonia,
14        diammonium phosphate.  It also affects the pH
15        of smoke, which influences the form of
16        nicotine, free and bound, unbound.
17              And profits.  Profits.  You know, despite
18        the harm -- despite people --
19              Which he says cigarette consumption is
20        going down.  R.J. Reynolds' profits continue to
21        rise.  They continue to rise.
22              And so I played that video of Dr. Raffa
23        for you, and so, here, let me explain -- let me
24        explain the reason why, so you understand what
25        net worth is and what net revenue is -- excuse me, net earnings.
2              So, net earnings, right?
3              Net earnings is when you take the amount
4        of money they make when they sell the
5        cigarettes, right, all of that money that they
6        make when they bring it in, and then you deduct
7        from it every expense that you can imagine,
8        everything, the cost of tobacco, cost of
9        manufacturing, you know, salaries for every
10        CEO, every employee, all the business that
11        needs to be conducted, you subtract all of it,
12        right?
13              If they have to pay punitive damages to
14        someone, subtract it, okay?  Subtract
15        everything.  Payments to the MSA, the FDA, all
16        of those things that they pay out, you subtract
17        all of it, subtract taxes, and you get their
18        net earnings, right, which, in 2013, after
19        everyone's taken care of, business is taken
20        care of, salaries, golden parachutes, they have
21        1.606 billion in net earnings, which is excess
22        cash, excess cash that they can do what they
23        choose to do with it.
24              And if you break that down, it comes
25        out -- sorry, I think I just lasered you in the eye; I apologize -- you come up with
2        $4.4 million in profit.  $4.4 million in profit
3        every day -- every day -- from selling
4        cigarettes.
5              I wrote down their net worth.  It's about
6        $7.2 billion in 2013.  $7.2 billion.
7              The amount of money is up to you.  It
8        needs to be significant.  They need to feel it,
9        okay?  Two or $3 million or $4 million, this
10        defendant will not feel it, they will not
11        understand it, they will not change.
12              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
13              THE COURT:  Sustained.
14              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike.
15              THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
16        last comment.
17              MR. ROSEN:  The amount of money is up to
18        you, okay?  You can go higher, you can go
19        lower.  There's a concept in law -- in law,
20        which is called treble damages, triple damages.
21              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
22              THE COURT:  Sustained.
23              MR. ROSEN:  My suggestion is --
24              We are here two days, two days in a
25        punitive damage phase.  My suggestion is two days of what their net profit is.  Two days.
2        8.8 million, okay?  8.8 million.
3              That will get their attention.  That will
4        get their attention.  They will feel that.  The
5        CEO of R.J. Reynolds will hear about it.
6              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
7              THE COURT:  Sustained.
8              MR. ROSEN:  And that's approximately
9        three times the compensatory damage award.
10        Approximately.  Nine million would be three
11        times.
12              Thank you again.


21              MR. ROSEN:  Yes, Your Honor.
22              This is a corporation that has created
23        and sustained an epidemic of death and disease.
24        I mean, the death toll keeps climbing from --
25        from this product.  Number one cause of lung cancer, chief preventable cause of premature
2        death, number one cause of COPD.
3              You know, counsel talked about the FDA.
4        The FDA, you can't change anything without the
5        FDA.  They love it.  They love it.
6              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
7              THE COURT:  Sustained.
8              MR. ROSEN:  They had ninety --
9              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike.  I'm
10        sorry, Judge.
11              THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
12        last comment.  It's stricken.
13              MR. ROSEN:  Ninety-six years to perfect
14        their product before it was regulated by the
15        FDA.  It was 2009 when they first got
16        regulated.
17              Do we have the pharmaceutical --
18              TECHNICIAN:  Yeah.
19              MR. KEEHFUS:  Can I see it before you --
20              MR. ROSEN:  Oh, it's in evidence.
21              TECHNICIAN:  PT4791 in evidence.
22              MR. ROSEN:  PT4791.
23              In any event, you have the document in
24        evidence.
25              A highly ritualized, stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.  That's what they
2        were saying back in the 1970s, right?
3              And they hid it.  They hid it.  It
4        wasn't -- it wasn't regulated until 2009.
5              And you know what?  You know why they're
6        regulated?  Because they couldn't regulate
7        themselves.
8              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
9        Move to strike.
10              THE COURT:  Sustained.

12              THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
13        last comment.  It's stricken.
14              MR. ROSEN:  Dr. Figlar told you --
15              I think he said they're the only company
16        that has to pay for themselves to be regulated.
17        Pay for themselves.  Imagine that.
18              It was the Wild West for decades and
19        decades and decades, for them to perfect that
20        design of the cigarette, and now it's regulated
21        and now nothing can be changed --
22              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
23        That's misleading.
24              THE COURT:  Sustained.
25              MR. ROSEN:  -- unless the FDA says so. And you know what?  The FDA has regulated
2        them since 2009.  They got a lot of catching up
3        to do.  Who do you think knows the product
4        better, R.J. Reynolds or the FDA?
5              3100 Engle cases, counsel talked to you
6        about.  That's it, 3100; right?  Five hundred
7        thousand people dying every year, right, and
8        we're talking about a class of people, we're
9        talking about just a very small class that was
10        probably very, very large at one point.
11              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.

15              MR. ROSEN:  Everyone --
16              THE COURT:  Excuse me, Counsel.
17              MR. ROSEN:  Sorry, Judge.
18              THE COURT:  It's stricken.  The jury is
19        to disregard.
20              MR. ROSEN:  And you know who the class
21        is?  It was people who were diagnosed or died
22        before 1996, in Florida.  And there's 3100
23        left, you know?
24              And you didn't hear any evidence about
25        how many of those cases will ever make it to court, or how many of those people died
2        waiting --
3              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
4        Move to strike.
5              THE COURT:  Sustained.  This is all
6        speculation, Counsel.
7              MR. ROSEN:  Snus, that was a product that
8        counsel talked about.
9              You know, I want to talk about the MSA
10        first.  I'm sorry.  The MSA, they were being
11        sued by 40 -- well, I think every single State
12        Attorneys General --
13              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
14              THE COURT:  Sustained.
15              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike.
16              THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
17        last comment.
18              MR. ROSEN:  The MSA was entered in -- in
19        1999.  When was it, then, they first admitted;
20        right?
21              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
22              THE COURT:  Sustained.
23              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike.
24              THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard --
25              MR. HOHNBAUM:  And motion. THE COURT:  -- the last comment.
2              MR. ROSEN:  I mean, the Tobacco
3        Institute -- the Tobacco Institute was in
4        existence right up until 1999.
5              Snus, they were talking about this is a
6        great product.  I mean, Dr. Figlar admitted
7        it -- I had to push him a little bit, but it
8        increases the risk of pancreatic cancer.
9              You know, they're not -- they're --
10              They came in here and they talked about
11        migrating customers.  They're not just selling
12        cigarettes; they're growing.  And that's what
13        their documents say, that's what their website
14        says.  That's what R.J. Reynolds is doing.
15              Eclipse, that's that lower-risk product
16        that we talked about, a billion dollars was
17        spent.  And how much did the industry pay to
18        market the combustible traditional modern
19        cigarette?  You heard evidence it was
20        $250 billion.  That's what the industry was
21        spending to market the deadly product, but a
22        billion to produce this other one.
23              And he talked about, you know, it's on
24        our website, the best course for our -- for our
25        smokers, our customers, is to quit.  You know, listen, if you have -- if you're concerned,
2        quit.
3              Like it's that easy.  Like it's that
4        easy.  They know it's not that easy, and
5        they've known that for decades.
6              You know, when you heard -- you know, you
7        heard --
8              You know, he talked about adult -- you
9        know, adults that make the decision, but
10        who's -- who -- who -- what's the age when
11        people start smoking?
12              And you heard those statistics, also.
13        It's like 70, 80 percent are under 18.  You
14        know, they start --
15              And you heard about how -- how that
16        affects people.  And so it's not just some
17        simple thing, you go to their website, hey, we
18        advise them quit.  It's not that easy.
19              Counsel talked about how the money that
20        you award will go to Vivian and William --
21        William Wilkinson, okay, it doesn't go to
22        charity, it doesn't go to --
23              You can't consider -- you can't consider
24        what good she would do --
25              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor. MR. ROSEN:  -- with --
2              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike and motion.
3              THE COURT:  Sustained.
4              MR. ROSEN:  Well, they -- they brought
5        it --
6              They brought it up, they said to you that
7        it's not going to charity, that it's not going
8        to some other -- it's going to them, okay?
9              So you've heard the instruction that the
10        purpose is not to further compensate.  We're at
11        a different -- we're talking about a whole
12        different category.  We're talking about
13        punishing them.
14              You know, listen, it's fine for them to
15        sell the product.  I'm not saying --
16              It's a legal product.  Sell it.  If you
17        come into the courtroom, tell the truth.
18        You're growing that product, you're not
19        migrating people away from it.  Tell the truth
20        about it.
21              You know, and I still heard -- I still
22        heard counsel talk about the CTR like it was a
23        good thing, right?  The best and the cheapest
24        insurance --
25              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained.
2              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Move to strike.
3              THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard.
4              MR. ROSEN:  Did we give them copies?
5              TECHNICIAN:  No.
6              MR. ROSEN:  (Handing.)
7              You can put it up.
8              TECHNICIAN:  I'm sorry, what number, 30?
9              MR. ROSEN:  Thirty, yeah.
10              The manufacture, sale and advertising of
11        cigarettes is a lawful activity.  I've never
12        said otherwise.  And they can't be punished for
13        just merely -- merely advertising and selling,
14        but they can be punished for concealment, for
15        conspiracy, for fraud, for misrepresentation,
16        for lies, and very specifically for the tragic
17        suffering and death of Vivian Wilkinson.
18              All the money that they paid to the MSA
19        or the FDA, none of that -- none of that has
20        anything to do specifically with the harm
21        caused to Vivian Wilkinson.
22              And any amount of money of punitive
23        damages that they paid in another case has
24        nothing to do with this case, because you're
25        going to see the instructions talk very specifically about awarding punitive damages
2        for the conduct that caused Vivian Wilkinson
3        harm.
4              You know, Claude Teague, Jim Johnston,
5        Ed Horrigan, the CTR, right, you didn't hear
6        that they were fired or demoted.  You heard
7        none of that.
8              The amount should bear a reasonable
9        relationship to compensatory damages.  Three
10        hundred to $600,000 will not get their
11        attention.  It will not.  Three times
12        compensatory, treble damages, I would suggest
13        to you will -- they will feel it, they will
14        know it --
15              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Objection, Your Honor.
16              MR. ROSEN:  -- they will respect it.
17              THE COURT:  Sustained.
18              MR. ROSEN:  Thank you.
