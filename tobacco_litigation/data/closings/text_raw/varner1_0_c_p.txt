15          MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
16    Court, counsel.
17          Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank
18    you.  You all are folks that have sacrificed a
19    lot to be here with us, to participate in this
20    jury system.  We can't thank you enough.  The
21    Court personnel, we can't thank them enough.
22          And we're just honored and proud to be
23    able to present this case and be able to wrap
24    it up at this juncture, and I'm just going to
25    jump right in.  My time is limited.   So, the verdict form, which is what you
2    all are going to fill out and check off
3    questions --
4          And Mr. Keehfus mentioned that every
5    single question on the verdict form only talks
6    about Virginia Varner, and I wanted to
7    elaborate on that a bit, because every single
8    question on the verdict form not only talks
9    about Virginia Varner, but always in terms of
10    cigarettes.
11          And you can't separate out Virginia
12    Varner, or so many other smokers in this
13    country -- 45 million of them at this time --
14    from cigarettes and the role they play.
15          This case is about what cigarettes do to
16    people, the harm they cause, the addiction they
17    cause.  The mothers, brothers, aunties, uncles,
18    children, grandparents who are left behind to
19    grieve and suffer in what is a -- what is very
20    much not a peaceful end to an existence.
21          And I always think about, when they say
22    the word "pleasure," is this the price for
23    pleasure?  You will see, there is no socially
24    redeeming benefit to cigarettes in this
25    country.  It's a business, and that's all it is.
2          But the questions pertain to Virginia
3    Varner and the nexus of the production of the
4    product, defective and dangerous product, that
5    are the cigarettes, and every question is how
6    did Virginia Varner inter- -- interact with
7    cigarettes.  They produced the cigarettes.
8    This is about what cigarettes do to people.
9    It's very important to consider.
10          But the very last question on the jury
11    instruction -- on the jury -- jury verdict
12    form -- I'm sorry, you got the instructions --
13    on the verdict form:
14          Under the circumstances of this case,
15    please state whether you find, by clear and
16    convincing evidence, that punitive damages are
17    warranted against:  Philip Morris USA Inc.,
18    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and the check
19    mark for "yes" or "no."
20          So that only talks about them, a fine.
21    They've not been fined.  Punishment.
22          And one has said that punishment is
23    justice for the unjust.  They richly deserve
24    it.  We hope we proved it.  We're going to talk
25    about it.   But I wanted to talk about the very last
2    question first, and talk to you all about how
3    you get there if, when I stitch this case
4    together, you see this our way.
5          And the very first thing I thought about
6    was just some of the topics of what this
7    business is all about.  I'm going to try to do
8    it quick.
9          Doubt is our product.  You thought they
10    manufactured cigarettes.  They manufacture
11    doubt.  Without nicotine, cigarette sales would
12    collapse and we would all be out of business
13    overnight.
14          This is the industry's internal
15    documents.  They were not known until the late
16    '90s and 2000.  They were not known in the
17    '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s.  They were the
18    secret of what they really meant behind the
19    scenes.  The second face.  Not the public face;
20    the true internal face.
21          The illusion of filtration:  The filters
22    will be fake, the health reassurance to get
23    folks to keep smoking, the psychological crutch
24    we must provide our smokers who might be
25    worrying about health who are now going to get sick.  The base of our business is the high
2    school student.
3          One of my favorite songs --
4          It's not a favorite song.  I liked Elton
5    John when I was growing up in the '70s.  I went
6    to high school and I --
7          MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object.
8    This is a personal story.
9          THE COURT:  Overruled.  This is argument,
10    Counsel.
11          MR. SCHLESINGER:  There's a song that he
12    has on -- I think his third album, "Honky
13    Chateau."  It's called -- called --
14          I'm a little nervous, you know?
15          It's called "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters,"
16    all right?
17          And it's just got some great -- you know,
18    great lines in there.  But he talks about "I
19    thought I knew, but now I know, that rose trees
20    never grow in New York City."
21          And he goes on and on and on, but it's
22    that line where he says, "I thought I knew, but
23    now I know."
24          One jury at a time, in the Engle progeny
25    cases, in the decertified class, in the group of folks who are Engle progeny jurors, in the
2    group of folks who are Engle progeny
3    plaintiffs --
4          You are an Engle progeny juror.
5    Mr. Varner and his wife are Engle progeny
6    plaintiffs.  What is "progeny"?  The children
7    of Engle.  "I thought I knew, but now I know."
8          We all came in here, we talked to folks,
9    and there was more folks in the jury selection
10    process than there were here now.  They were
11    filled up --
12          You were in those seats, you sat on those
13    hard benches, and we heard what folks thought
14    about cigarettes.  Everybody thinks they know
15    something about cigarettes, but now you know.
16          So I say, now you know something about
17    cigarettes you didn't know, and why this would
18    be a valuable and worthwhile course to take.
19          But calling youth, calling children,
20    calling youngsters "replacement smokers,"
21    perhaps you will agree with me that that meets
22    the bounds -- that goes beyond the bounds of
23    humane conduct, and gets into the recklessness,
24    the disregard for considerations of human life
25    and health, that justify punitive damages. That's why I started with this.
2          And I will tell you right now, you know,
3    we are completely coned down, completely
4    granular, focused, 24/7, on this case, and the
5    job that we do, it's the nature of the trial
6    lawyer, but we are not unmindful of world
7    events; however, they do not have any role in
8    this courtroom right now.
9          We can't reflect upon them, we can't talk
10    about them.  We are in a crucible together,
11    where you all have been cut off from all of
12    your electronic devices, despite the fact that
13    this entire courtroom is bristling with
14    electronics and bristling with technology that
15    never existed when my 12- or 13-year-old client
16    was smoking cigarettes in the 1950s.  No such
17    thing existed.
18          We have to put ourselves back in that
19    time and think about what was the world like
20    for her.  She smoked during a period of time in
21    the world she grew up in, that she lived in,
22    that was normal.  No appreciation of the
23    dangers, all right?  So we live in a different
24    time.
25          Now, you're going to have to ask -- answer these questions.  I read them to you and
2    we hope you'll answer them "yes."  And we hope
3    that the evidence supports the concept that you
4    will answer them "yes."  It will take us to the
5    next phase of the trial.
6          And the next phase of the trial will
7    take, hopefully, no more than tomorrow, if you
8    deliberate today and come to a ver- -- a
9    verdict; but sometimes the juries take a day, a
10    half a day, six days.  There's no --
11          The Judge will --
12          MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection.  I would object
13    to what other juries do, Your Honor.
14          THE COURT:  Sustained.
15          MR. SCHLESINGER:  The Judge --
16          The Judge will tell you that the
17    deliberation period of time is up to you all.
18    You take as little or as long as you like to do
19    it, to work through this.  Whenever you're done
20    with it.  We can't -- we sometimes --
21          The defendants, more often than us, may
22    present some brief evidence --
23          MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection.
24          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
25          THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.   MR. SCHLESINGER:  Phase II has evidence
2    that is far briefer.  It's about net worth than
3    anything else, because the only thing --
4          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
5          THE COURT:  Sustained.  Counsel --
6          MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'll move on, I'll move
7    on.  I don't want to get bogged down.  I'm
8    sorry.
9          All right.  So you know what the Frank
10    Statement said.  It was a promise to the
11    American people.  It was the biggest
12    advertisement in the history -- in the history
13    of United States advertising.  And it was
14    designed to get that message out, promises it
15    wasn't bad for you, basic responsibility more
16    important than business, not injurious to
17    health, safeguarding the public health, all
18    those charges have been abandoned for lack of
19    evidence, and we're going to put up an
20    unimpeachable, integrity guy in charge of the
21    committee.
22          But, in reality, the real business wasn't
23    that they have a paramount interest in others;
24    it's "who ain't for more money."  It was about
25    making money, making profits.  They disregarded the health of their customers to make money.
2          Similarly, they promised they would
3    cooperate with the public health, but really
4    they smeared and belittled them.  They would
5    say he's a --
6          They would attack him, so that when you
7    saw labels that talked about the "Surgeon
8    General says" on the pack of a side of
9    cigarettes, they worked heavily to undermine
10    the efficacy --
11          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
12          MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- and authority --
13          MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection.
14          THE COURT:  Sustained.
15          Counsel, you got to slow down.
16          MR. KEEHFUS:  Move to disregard.
17          THE COURT:  You've got to slow down.
18          MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike the last
19    comment.
20          THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
21    last comment.  It's stricken.
22          MR. SCHLESINGER:  As you know, they --
23    they actively smeared and belittled the Surgeon
24    General.  They said that he was having
25    publicity stunts and he was intentionally misleading the American people.  And that was a
2    lie.  It wasn't true.  True.  But it was a very
3    successful campaign because they manufactured
4    doubt.  They manufactured lung cancer.
5          What kind of business is it?  We
6    manufacture a nicotine-delivery device.  We
7    manufacture addiction, doubt, and lung cancer.
8    And millions and millions of people, in the era
9    in which those folks grew up in, bought it
10    hook, line, and sinker.
11          So, you know, all the charges have been
12    abandoned for lack of evidence, it's not
13    dangerous; but in their documents, going way
14    back into the early '60s, even the Claude
15    Teague documents in the '50s, indicated that
16    the amount of evidence accumulated to indict
17    cigarette smoke as a health hazard is
18    overwhelming, and the evidence challenging such
19    an indictment is scant.  They knew full well,
20    before the '50s, that what they made caused
21    cancer.
22          And it brings up an interesting point.
23    When we played part of Dr. Figlar, reflect upon
24    all those 18th Cent- -- 1800s, 19th Century
25    articles that they trotted out in cross-examination of Dr. Proctor.
2          What was the point of that?  That in some
3    dusty stack, somewhere in a library, they,
4    through research, were able to find the word
5    "danger" or "addiction" in some old medical
6    article?
7          Was Virginia Varner, who hadn't been born
8    for another 50 or a hundred years, supposed to
9    know about that?
10          If that was common knowledge, the common
11    knowledge defense, then why in the world didn't
12    they know about it?  Why did they invent the
13    Bonsack machine and start pumping out
14    cigarettes in the millions, and mass marketing?
15    Why did they embark upon this campaign if it
16    was such common knowledge that cigarettes were
17    deadly and addictive?
18          It might have been to them.  It certainly
19    wasn't to Virginia Varner or the American
20    people.
21          And, as Dr. Proctor said, the message of
22    the public health and those old articles were
23    like a snowflake in a snowstorm.  We'll talk
24    about that.
25          Unimpeachable integrity.  Clarence Cook Little, who they put in charge of it, was not
2    unimpeachable integrity when he said:  And you
3    asked, have we looked for carcinogenic
4    substance in tobacco smoke.  And we have not
5    because we do not believe they are there.
6          So that was -- it was obfuscation, doubt,
7    a front, a holding strategy.  The whole thing
8    was a fake, designed to keep selling
9    cigarettes, keep people smoking.
10          They said that their research
11    corporations, this TIRC, the CTR, all of these
12    guys are co-conspirators, they're all --
13    they're all contributorily culpable.
14          Meaning, a conspirator is, we get
15    together in a group and we conspire.  And
16    Dr. Proctor said, conspiracy, it's (indicating)
17    inspiration, conspiracy.  The breathing
18    together.
19          You know, imagine huddled together in the
20    Plaza Hotel, heads -- titans of industry --
21    during a period of time where folks trusted
22    industry -- titans of industry, breathing
23    together, discussing together, whispering among
24    themselves of what we were going to do.
25          It's killing people.  What are we going to do?  We're going to keep making them, we're
2    making fortunes of money.  And what are we
3    going to tell the American people?  It's not
4    bad for you.
5          This is why this case calls out for and
6    screams for a fine, punishment.  That's --
7    that's the important part of the case to us.
8          And you can see they had a front and a
9    shield, and they're only interested in evidence
10    which denies the allegations that cigarette
11    smoking causes disease.  Weren't trying to get
12    to the truth, weren't using --
13          They were using the exact opposite of
14    folks with unimpeachable integrity and national
15    repute.
16          And then, in 1994, after the CEOs --
17          The CEOs, major men of major
18    responsibility, major might, major power, got
19    up and all raised their hand and lied to
20    congressmen, the --
21          As -- as Dr. Proctor called it, the iron
22    uniformity of the conspiracy, that had held
23    together, okay, no matter what, to the "I will
24    tell these lies to my death."  More
25    importantly, "I will tell these lies to the death of millions of Americans for profits."
2          These are the kinds of things that are
3    not humane.  And all Florida citizens encompass
4    and embraces --
5          And if you just take the death rates in
6    the United States -- and Proctor spit out a lot
7    of statistics -- it has to encompass hundreds
8    of thousands of people that were included in
9    the class.  That's why it's a big --
10          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
11          MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's all Florida
12    citizens.
13          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
14          THE COURT:  Sustained, counsel.
15          MR. KEEHFUS:  Move to strike.
16          MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's a reasonable --
17          THE COURT:  Excuse me.  The jury is to
18    disregard the last comment.
19          MR. SCHLESINGER:  To hear the defendants
20    say it, nobody would ever be in the class, and
21    that would make no sense.
22          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
23          MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
24          MR. SCHLESINGER:  And --
25          THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Overruled.  This is argument.
2          MR. SCHLESINGER:  Here's the most --
3          Here's the most important thing about it:
4    That word in there, "addiction," that His Honor
5    says we're not going to give you any particular
6    definition of it, she meets every single part
7    of that.  And it's all there.  She's a class
8    member.  That's --
9          It's supposed to be all of those folks.
10    All of them.  And they cannot deny addiction
11    causes disease.  It makes you smoke too much
12    and you get sick.  It's compulsive.
13          How about someone who smoked four -- who
14    drank four million sips of cocktail high balls,
15    right?  A Manhattan, with a shot of whiskey in
16    it, ten sips in a cup, 20 of them a day, seven
17    days a week, for 40 years.  What would you call
18    that person?  An enjoyable social drinker?  Or
19    would you call them an alcoholic?
20          Twenty drinks a day, ten sips in a cup,
21    to get alcohol.  What would you call that
22    person?
23          How about three million snorts of
24    cocaine?  How about 300,000 snorts of cocaine
25    because it lasts ten times longer than the hit of a cigarette?
2          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
3          THE COURT:  Overruled.
4          MR. SCHLESINGER:  What would you call
5    that person?  You would call them a drug
6    addict.
7          That was the amazing thing about what
8    these drugs were.  They were drugs that hide in
9    plain sight, that look like totally normal
10    consumer products.  Tell --
11          You imagine a young boy walking up to his
12    dad and holding up this pack of cigarettes and
13    saying, "Daddy, what's this?"  And a father
14    looking to protect his son, saying, "it's bad."
15    And the son saying, "it doesn't look bad."
16          This looks like any other normal consumer
17    product:  Size, shape.  It hides in plain
18    sight.  It's not supposed to look like anything
19    abnormal.  How do you protect a kid from this?
20    How do you protect them?  So --
21          MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor --
22          THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Overruled.
23          MR. SCHLESINGER:  A Camel is a kid's toy.
24    Every kid's got toys.
25          So this is not heroin.  This is not a sniffling, itching junkie, with mucus dripping
2    out of his nose, robbing a liquor store to try
3    to get a fix for smack.  That's not what this
4    is.
5          Nicotine doesn't make you that high.
6    Nicotine is socially acceptable.  It's a social
7    standard.  That's the era in which she was
8    smoking cigarettes.
9          So, the greater weight of evidence.  What
10    is the greater weight of evidence?  It's the
11    more convincing force and effect of the
12    evidence in the case.
13          Oops.  I knew I would do that.
14          All right.  Anyway, I'll do it by hand.
15          The point is, on balance, whose case
16    makes more sense?  It's not to the exclusion of
17    any and all reasonable doubt, it's not a
18    criminal burden or standard; it's, on balance,
19    whose case makes more sense?  Where is the
20    greater weight of the evidence?
21          So what is the simple truth in this case?
22    And I told you at the very beginning of this
23    case, it really is --
24          And you can make it as --
25          You can make it difficult.  When we litigate it, we can make it difficult, but this
2    is what it is:  Smoking cigarettes is drug
3    addiction.  The compulsive act of sucking 20 or
4    30 cigarettes down, ten puffs a cigarette,
5    seven days a week, without fail, for 40 years,
6    is dependence on a drug, okay?
7          And when you take her within a couple of
8    years --
9          That picture is within a couple of years
10    before she started smoking.  She's nine or ten
11    in that picture.  Within a year or two, she's
12    smoking cigarettes.  Could she make a
13    long-range lifestyle choice?  Did she know she
14    was going to get hooked?  I don't think so.
15          So this is why Virginia Varner's in the
16    Engle class.  And I -- I want you to be
17    thinking about this.  This is a timeline.
18    1954 --
19          I mean, she is the Engle class.  She is
20    so right on the critical dates.  1954, DOS,
21    date of smoking; 1954, DOC, date of conspiracy.
22    That's when they put out the Frank Statement.
23    That's when they saw the mice painting studies
24    were resulting in cancer.
25          And, then, all the way through the '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s, what was going on?  They
2    were lying, denying, producing doubt,
3    manufacturing doubt, propagating lung cancer,
4    working with nicotine as a center of their
5    universe.
6          It's:  I thought I knew, but now I know.
7    Now I know.  Now I know.  One jury at a time.
8    1995 --
9          MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
10          THE COURT:  Sustained.
11          MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- on January 1st --
12          MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
13          THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Just talk about
14    this case, Counsel.
15          MR. SCHLESINGER:  One --
16          January 1st, New Year's Day, and she
17    passes.  And you heard how she passes in those
18    records.  And that is the way --
19          It was not a peaceful way to go, moaning
20    in pain, with her family gathered around her
21    bedside, with the food -- choking and going
22    into her lungs from her throat from the
23    esophageal hole.
24          It's an ignominious end.  She ended with
25    a whimper, just like they said when they made the conspiracy in 1954, that they were in fear,
2    that this is the way their world would end:
3    Not with a bang, but with a whimper.
4          That's T.S. Eliot, the poem "The Hollow
5    Men."  That's why I said her world ended with a
6    whimper, not theirs.
7          But they feared it would.  And they
8    didn't fear for themselves and their physical
9    health or their moral obligation to their
10    fellow man; they feared for their money.  And
11    today you will speak to them in the only
12    language they understand:  Money.
13          MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection.
14          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
15          THE COURT:  Sustained.
16          MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
17          THE COURT:  The jury is to disregard the
18    last comment.
19          MR. SCHLESINGER:  So that's -- that's the
20    key points of the class.
21          And then there's one more thing on this.
22    There are two years here that don't matter and
23    there are two years here that do matter.  And I
24    want to point to you the two years that do
25    matter and the two years that don't matter, and do this real quick as I go through it, all
2    right?
3          So, right here, she's smoking, and she's
4    smoking those Winstons from the family.  And
5    there's a couple of years in there.  Is it two
6    years?  Is it three years?  When did she
7    switch, '58?  When was she smoking, '53?
8          We have enough evidence, the family lore,
9    the husband who, when he first ever met her,
10    she was a smoker.  Those two years matter for
11    Mr. Keehfus' client, for Reynolds, because they
12    initiate and sustain the addiction in that
13    youthful pediatric brain, that adolescent
14    brain, that the younger it is, the more
15    susceptible it is to the application and
16    exposure of nicotine.  So she was the most
17    vulnerable then.
18          And you can't revise history and say, if
19    she didn't smoke those Winstons and it never
20    happened in those few years, things would have
21    automatically been the same, because maybe she
22    would have met a boyfriend that didn't smoke.
23    You don't know what she would have done in '57
24    or '58 if she had never smoked.  Maybe she
25    would have been more mature, she would have had a chance.  But they can't speculate it wouldn't
2    have made a difference.
3          But I can tell you that those two years,
4    according to Dr. DiFranza, a world-renowned
5    professor and legitimate expert, dedicating his
6    life, heroically, to the study and scourges of
7    addiction, told you that those years matter.
8    Even Dr. Gup said those years matter and every
9    cigarette causes you harm.  So those are the
10    two years that matter.
11          The two years that don't matter, that we
12    heard quite a bit about as Mr. Geraghty put
13    forth his side of the story, his version that
14    is the defense he -- he wants to suggest you
15    consider, and that is -- oops -- and that is
16    here (indicating).
17          This is my right hand where the laser is;
18    this is my left hand where the clicker is.
19    Sorry.
20          1994, in July, she's got lung cancer from
21    smoking, from tobacco addiction, a devastating
22    six months to live.  I mean, just -- that's --
23    that is --
24          You're now staring at the abyss.  It's
25    over.  We can't -- we can't save you.  We can't cut it out of you.  You're 53 years old.
2    Fifty-three years old.
3          In 1992, Joe had a heart attack.  Joe had
4    a heart attack, and that should have served as
5    the warning, despite their denials to the
6    contrary, that she should have quit at that
7    time?  The two years that didn't matter.
8          You heard Dr. Gup.  Cancer was growing in
9    her lungs in 1992.  She couldn't smoke
10    cigarettes, a pack to two packs a day for 38
11    years, and take this supposed warning --
12          Which, by the way, the tobacco companies
13    would publicly say Joe's condition wasn't
14    caused by cigarettes, if anyone said his --
15          MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
16          MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- heart attack's
17    caused by cigarettes.
18          THE COURT:  Sustained.
19          MR. KEEHFUS:  Move to strike.
20          THE COURT:  The jury --
21          MR. SCHLESINGER:  The evidence in --
22          THE COURT:  Excuse me.  It's stricken.
23          MR. SCHLESINGER:  The evidence in the
24    case is they denied all forms of diseases were
25    being caused by cigarettes up through '94.   The point is, '92 is the two years that
2    don't matter, because trying to say that's when
3    she should have quit or that she was negligent
4    in not quitting then, doesn't take into account
5    the reality of the science, okay?
6          Now, again, here it is.  Diagnosis, class
7    member.  What did Dr. Gup say?  A treating
8    physician, a legitimate guy that met her,
9    treated her in 1994.  His only interest was
10    helping her, understanding what was wrong with
11    her, a specialist who spends so much of his
12    time with the diseases and scourges of this
13    problem.
14          And he said, in no uncertain terms, she's
15    got a two-pack history a day for 40 years, a
16    one pack for the last month.
17          Remember, she was coughing and coughing
18    up blood, so she cut down smoking for a month
19    while she's fixing to be dying of cancer.  And
20    then she's got left lung cancer, the chronic
21    obstructive pulmonary disease, and tobacco
22    addiction.
23          24 25    follows:) Q.    When you wrote in your very first visit
2 with her, after assessing her, your impression of
3 bronchogenic cancer on the left, COPD, and tobacco
4 addiction, that was all written in one place at one
5 time.  Why did you write all three of those together?
6        A.    To show that the cancer is due to the
7 tobacco addiction.
8                (Video clip concluded.)
9              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now, this is a treating
10        doctor.  This is the hook they can't get off
11        of.  That is class membership.  Was she a
12        Floridian?  Was she a heavy smoker?  Was she
13        addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes?  Did
14        that nicotine drive that compulsive smoking to
15        result in disease?
16              The answer from an unimpeachable,
17        credible, caring physician, no axe to grind, no
18        stake in the outcome, someone who is there at
19        the time -- and what I've heard said,
20        "documentation trumps conversation" -- he wrote
21        it down 22 years ago -- thank you, Dr. Gup --
22        because we have that evidence here, and that's
23        all you need, because you do not have to make a
24        mountain out of a molehill.
25              The threshold requirement of class membership is proven.  It's -- look at all the
2        smoking.  This is --
3              We didn't show you all the records.  This
4        is in the records you have in evidence.  You
5        can try to dig through them and see it; but all
6        through the records, she's documented not only
7        by Dr. Gup, but by everybody who saw her in
8        July, in August, of being a long-term heavy
9        smoker, okay?
10              Forty -- 40 years, a pack-per-day smoker,
11        one pack per day, two packs -- two packs per
12        day for 40 years, one pack per day her last
13        month.
14              Did she -- did she say she quit somewhere
15        in the record a couple of weeks ago?
16              So, 8/18, she said she quit.  That means
17        that, for several weeks after her lung cancer
18        diagnosis, she's smoking.  And what did Dr. Gup
19        see in August?  That she was still smoking.
20        And Lori was sneaking her cigarettes.
21              And what did we hear?  People sneak
22        cigarettes because they're embarrassed to do
23        it.  When you're dying of lung cancer, maybe
24        your other family members are going to get on
25        you about that. So Lori was doing it, she was sneaking
2        cigarettes.  The other family members didn't
3        see it or didn't know about it.  That means it
4        didn't happen?
5              These are the eyewitnesses to what, back
6        then, was a mundane activity.  We are asking
7        folks to remember what happened 20, 30, 40, 50
8        years ago, in what was a perfectly normal --
9              Like, tell me about brushing your teeth.
10        Tell me about, you know, how you're making --
11        you're making your coffee.  Tell me about your
12        coffee cup.
13              The medical records document that this
14        woman was a long-time heavy smoker, so --
15              And what did -- what did her -- what did
16        her daughter say?
17              18     19        follows:)
20        Q.    So where did she keep the cigarette pack
21 that she was smoking?
22        A.    Wherever she was.  If she was in the
23 kitchen, she would keep them on the kitchen counter.
24 If she was in the living room, sitting down, they
25 would be next to her on a coffee table or side table. Q.    Okay.
2        A.    In her bedroom, she had an ashtray right
3 next to her bed on the nightstand.
4              I don't recall if she smoked in the
5 bathroom, obviously, because the door was closed, so I
6 don't know about that, but...
7                (Video clip concluded.)
8              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  So the point is,
9        cigarettes were everywhere.
10              And this next -- this next one, I'm not
11        going to play it; but, basically, it talked
12        about the fact that they were --
13              One of the debates was, well, you know,
14        was she having withdrawal.  You know, when
15        she -- when she was trying to quit, after she
16        had a lung cancer diagnosis, after they're
17        radiating her, cutting her open like a fish,
18        giving her morphine, and all kinds of narcotic
19        pain medications, did you notice that she had
20        withdrawal symptoms?  Right?  And you didn't
21        see her having withdrawal symptoms.
22              A lady's dying, she's in excruciating
23        distress, the family is traumatized by the pain
24        of it and someone's supposed to be
25        distinguishing withdrawal symptoms? This clip, which I'll skip, talks --
2              And you may remember it, because I don't
3        want to subject you to too much more than the
4        three hours of Lisa you already heard, but she
5        says it was a combination of all the things,
6        you couldn't separate out what part was -- was
7        craving or irritability or -- or desire; but
8        the fact that she was sneaking her cigarettes
9        meant that, despite she was dying, she really
10        wanted those cigarettes.
11              So it isn't realistic to try to say, hey,
12        everything's great.  You know, one of the
13        things --
14              Did you use smoking-cessation aids?  And
15        I listened to her, I listened to her, I
16        listened to her say, smoking --
17              Did she use the patch?
18              The patch didn't even come out over the
19        counter until 1996, after she was dead.  These
20        were not available.  And they blocked the
21        introduction of the Merrell Dow nicotine gum,
22        and we'll talk about that.
23              But did you use the patch, the patch that
24        wasn't available until 1996?  And, no, we
25        didn't use the patch.  No, we used another cessation method.  What was that?  Lung cancer.
2              To a tobacco industry, is that what's a
3        cessation method, lung cancer?  Fear of death?
4              Mr. Varner, he quit smoking cigarettes in
5        '92 because the doc said you're going to die.
6        Well, what -- if someone says you're going
7        to --
8              That's what -- that's what it takes to
9        get someone to quit?  That's addiction.  That's
10        dependence on a drug.
11              I'll skip that.
12              Now, class membership.  And you will not
13        see this in the jury instructions, or Question
14        1 on the verdict form about class membership.
15        You will not see the word "choice," "personal
16        responsibility," "fun," "pleasure."
17              "Something Wonderful Happens."  Can you
18        imagine an old TV show of a beautiful woman,
19        Julie London, singing "something wonderful
20        happens?"
21              What is wonderful?  Getting lung cancer?
22        Getting emphysema?  Dying?  Where is the truth
23        in advertising?  They don't advertise the true
24        realities of what tobacco does to folks.
25              And when you get to class membership, none of these things here have anything to do
2        with class membership, especially fault.  And
3        that's important to remember that -- that there
4        is --
5              You don't want to let there be a
6        conflation, a conflating of -- of
7        addiction/dependence driving disease that puts
8        you in the -- in the class with a simple
9        threshold, demonstrated by Dr. Gup's record,
10        and the idea of, you enjoyed it, you should
11        have tried harder to quit, things like that.
12        We'll talk about that.
13              But, here, it doesn't matter if addiction
14        was the only cause.  Whether addicts can and do
15        quit, that goes to fault.  Whether they share
16        responsibility, whether making cigarettes is
17        legal, as Dr. Proctor said, it's not legal to
18        give it to -- to children.
19              Exactly when a -- a smoker understands
20        the dangers of smoking, the reliance on
21        statements, whether addicts say "I like
22        smoking," "I'm going to die, anyway," whether
23        they enjoy the drug they're addicted to, that
24        is not class membership and the Judge isn't
25        going to instruct you that way. And then here's Dr. Ticknor.  And I'm not
2        going to --
3              I can spend a lot of time on him, but I'm
4        not going to spend a lot of time on him because
5        I'll tell you what they say in Texas.  Old
6        saying among the ranchers.  It's called --
7              When they're -- when they're up there and
8        they're puffing and they're -- and they're --
9        and they're exaggerating their credentials
10        or -- or what they have, or braggadocious,
11        right?  Very -- very well-known saying, Texas
12        way -- and he's from Texas -- "Big hat, no
13        cattle."  "Big hat, no cattle."
14              And Dr. Ticknor gave you some anecdotal
15        story about something he did, that doesn't make
16        him a true expert, we believe the evidence
17        shows, in this condition; but it does make him
18        an impossible mathematician, because if you
19        find that of the most addicted smokers, as
20        Dr. DiFranza said, the Engle class members that
21        come --
22              MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
23              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- and sue --
24              THE COURT:  What's the objection?
25              MR. GERAGHTY:  Reference to other class members.
2              THE COURT:  Sustained.
3              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. DiFranza --
4              MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
5              THE COURT:  Jury is to disregard.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. DiFranza was asked
7        a question about did he find other folks
8        addicted; and when they asked him why, he -- in
9        the Engle class, he said it was because they
10        were the most addicted who had died of lung
11        cancer and other diseases of smoking.
12              That's testimony from Dr. DiFranza.  I'll
13        find it, read it to you.  But the fact is, is
14        that he also said that 95 percent of smokers
15        out there are addicted.
16              The numbers creep up if you're dealing
17        with a concentrated class of the most addicted,
18        heaviest smokers that succumb to diseases; but
19        according to Dr. Ticknor, if you do the math,
20        right, if you do the math, to get --
21              If it's one in 20 out of a regular group
22        of folks that are not dependent on nicotine in
23        cigarettes from smoking like a pack a day, then
24        it's one in 20 -- so that's .05 -- and if you
25        take .05 and you multiply it -- times itself 18 times, that's .05 raised to the power of 18 --
2        you get that the chances -- the mathematical
3        chances of Dr. Ticknor's 18 smokers who were --
4        none of whom were addicted is one in 260
5        septillion.
6              That's the biggest number I've ever said
7        in a courtroom.  One in 260 septillion.
8        Hundreds, thousands, millions, billions,
9        trillions, quadrillions, quintillions,
10        sextillions, septillions, okay, which means
11        it's impossible.  It means it can't be true.
12        That's the number of stars in the known
13        observable universe.  So it isn't realistic.
14              If you change the number and you put it
15        down to 75 percent or 80 percent addiction
16        rate, if you put it down to an 80 percent -- a
17        75 percent addiction rate, the odds are one in
18        69 billion.
19              You would be 230 times more likely to win
20        the Powerball lottery.  Those odds are one in
21        292 billion -- billion.  So, even at
22        75 percent, even at what Mr. -- what
23        Christopher Ticknor said was his 50 percent
24        rate, which Dr. DiFranza, the true expert
25        talked about, the folks -- He's an expert at a subject.
2              Dr. Ticknor, by virtue of graduating
3        school and going into the expert witness
4        business, is an expert at being a witness; but
5        the fact is, is that one in --
6              If it's a 50 percent addiction rate, then
7        it's still one in a quarter-million, which is
8        about the likelihood of being struck by
9        lightning --
10              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
11              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- in the United
12        States.
13              THE COURT:  Overruled.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  So that's considered
15        extremely improbable.
16              So that's why I told you that you may say
17        to yourself, well, how can His -- how can
18        His Honor, Judge Murphy, let this guy say what
19        he says?
20              MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection.
21              THE COURT:  Excuse me.
22              MR. SCHLESINGER:  How can he let them --
23              MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object to that and
24        make a motion.
25              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I -- THE COURT:  Excuse me.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I will --
3              THE COURT:  Excuse me, Counsel.  Let me
4        finish before you start talking --
5              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.
6              THE COURT:  -- all right?  It's --
7              The objection's sustained, it's stricken.
8        The jury is to disregard the last comment.
9              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sorry, Judge.
10              I was being rhetorical.  What I mean is,
11        this jury instruction --
12              Look, today, you all have great power in
13        this.  This is a great leveling of a playing
14        field, great power.
15              MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection to the phrase
16        "leveling of a playing field."
17              THE COURT:  Sustained.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And, in that regard,
19        the power is given to you by the law.  And some
20        of the law that gives you the power includes
21        the believability of witnesses instructions,
22        one of which is, when someone characterizes
23        themselves as an expert, you think about
24        everything -- the knowledge, skill, training,
25        experience, the bias, the money they earn, everything about that -- and then you give that
2        testimony the weight you think it deserves; or,
3        when it comes to experts, because they're a
4        special class in the courtroom, you may reject
5        it.
6              So the reason I'm not going to spend a
7        lot of time on Chris Ticknor is because we hope
8        the evidence shows he wasn't worthy of belief,
9        his testimony should be rejected.
10              And, don't forget, when Dr. Proctor
11        talked about the way in which and some of the
12        reasons why the tobacco industry way back when,
13        years ago --
14              MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
15              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
16              THE COURT:  Sustained.
17              MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. -- I'm talking
19        about what --
20              Dr. Proctor conferred with you on
21        internal documents, secret documents.  This is
22        one of the documents in evidence.
23              MR. GERAGHTY:  I object and ask that we
24        approach on this very briefly.
25              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Hold my time, please. (The following discussion was held at
2        sidebar:)
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.  May I get
15        set and pick up my time, Judge?
16              THE COURT:  Counsel, we have a running
17        clock here.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yep.  So --
19              THE COURT:  You may proceed.
20              MR. SCHLESINGER:  The clock runs when
21        you're in the penalty box, okay?  It's like
22        hockey.  In any event, I'll keep going.
23              Dr. Proctor talked about the purpose and
24        the role that a lot of their work played --
25              He talked about the pillars of the conspiracy.  Remember he drew the eight-armed
2        octopus and all the different elements that
3        went into keeping this conspiracy going?
4              One of them was a very important element
5        of it way back in those days, because they did
6        not want to be held responsible for the damage
7        they were doing.  So a big part of their
8        conspiracy was to hold off and -- and defend in
9        litigations way back then, and Dr. Proctor --
10              MR. GERAGHTY:  I would -- I would object,
11        Your Honor.
12              THE COURT:  Overruled.
13              MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
14              MR. SCHLESINGER:  The industry research
15        effort has included special projects designed
16        to find scientists and medical doctors who
17        might serve as industry witnesses in
18        legislative -- in lawsuits or in legislative
19        forums.  And, you know, he talked about the
20        three pillars of the conspiracy:  Public
21        opinion, legislation, and litigation.
22              And it makes sense, if you know you're
23        making a product that's killing a substantial
24        number of your customers and you're replacing
25        them with youth, which is a pretty incendiary thing to put in the documents, and you are
2        doing it for profit, clear-eyed, straight
3        ahead, you've decided to do that, you are also
4        trying to do what you can to stave off
5        regulation and any other ripple effects, any
6        repercussions of what you're doing.  And this
7        is a document that shows that.
8              Addiction is the legal cause if it
9        contributes substantially.  And the question
10        is, did the addiction play an important role?
11              The question is, if she wasn't addicted
12        to nicotine, would she have compulsively smoked
13        cigarettes all day long, from first thing in
14        the morning till first thing -- the last thing
15        at night, every day for 40 years?
16              Basically, put another way, because they
17        admit -- now they admit --
18              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
19              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- she got lung
20        cancer --
21              THE COURT:  What's the objection?
22              MR. KEEHFUS:  "Now they admit."
23              THE COURT:  Overruled.
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now they admit, in this
25        courtroom, about this case, that our client smoked enough cigarettes to get lung cancer and
2        emphysema and die.  But if you're admitting
3        that my client --
4              If you acknowledge that my client, that
5        Joe's wife, that Virginia smoked enough
6        cigarettes to get lung cancer and die, but they
7        would have you believe that she wasn't
8        dependent not one day in her life, that none of
9        that cigarette smoking was driven by the sine
10        qua non of their existence -- that without
11        which there is nothing, the center of their
12        universe, nicotine -- we would argue that that
13        doesn't stand to reason, and hope you see that
14        our way.
15              That's why we say "a" versus "the."  It
16        isn't whether it was the cause, whether it was
17        a cause; meaning, can you be addicted and still
18        enjoy your drugs?  Lots of drug addicts enjoy
19        their drugs.
20              The funny thing about --
21              The tragic thing about tobacco was, for
22        so many years, it was a secret addiction.
23        Folks didn't know why.  Sales were meteorically
24        going up, the people were smoking it up like
25        silly, and didn't understand that it was a drug that was controlling them.  That's what
2        Dr. Koop said.  We'll play that.
3              So here's a quick way of applying facts
4        to the law:  You can see addiction causes
5        continued smoking, lung cancer and death; but
6        look at the other things that can also
7        contribute to cause:  Stress, enjoyment,
8        pleasure, what have you.  That's why it need
9        not be the only cause.
10              Let's look at it this way:  Imagine the
11        cigarettes --
12              Because cigarettes are addictive.  The
13        Engle findings says cigarettes are addictive.
14        It doesn't say "they might be," "sometimes,"
15        "they could be," "maybe," "they could be once
16        but we can't find that guy."
17              It's not a theoretical concept; it's the
18        reality of the world, it's the truth of
19        science, and it's what we know now.  And the
20        more they study it, the more they see it
21        changes your brain permanently.
22              But here -- here's a way of taking the
23        concurring cause instruction, which can confuse
24        you when you see it in paper, and making a
25        pictograph. In order to be a legal cause of lung
2        cancer and death, cigarettes, addictive
3        cigarettes, addiction to cigarettes -- that's
4        what's represented by that imagery there -- may
5        not be the only cause.
6              The addiction to cigarettes may be a
7        legal cause of lung cancer even though it
8        operates in combination with fun, pleasure, the
9        joy of smoking, if such fun, pleasure, taste --
10        taste --
11              No taste buds in the lung, but it's
12        delicious in the mouth.  It's a delicious taste
13        even though the lungs can't taste, right?
14        Inhalation is what makes addiction unleash the
15        dragon of addiction.
16              -- if such fun occurs at the same time as
17        the addiction to cigarettes, and that the
18        addiction to cigarettes contributes
19        substantially to producing lung cancer.
20              And there's the death certificate.  Death
21        from lung cancer.  There's a way of looking at
22        that.  It's not all or nothing.  It's not a
23        cause -- it's not the cause, it's a cause.
24              And what did Dr. DiFranza say?  Does
25        addiction kill?  I mean, in simple terms, does addiction kill?  Yes, addiction kills.
2              How about nicotine addiction?  That kills
3        more than any other addiction.  The number one
4        killer in the United States.  More people are
5        dying right now in the United States from this.
6              We're at the peak of death in -- in this
7        year.  More people are dying than have ever
8        died before of cigarettes, and they're dying
9        more than all those other scourges combined.  A
10        hundred times more than heroin addicts.  More
11        than AIDS and automobile accidents and
12        homicides and terrible things all combined.
13              The number one killer in this country are
14        cigarettes.  It hides in plain sight.  It's an
15        irrational madness to have a product that kills
16        over half of its users reliably, over a half
17        million people in the United States.
18              This here (indicating), this is less than
19        a summer's supply of Marlboro cigarettes.
20        Seven cartons.  Seven weeks.  Ten packs a
21        carton, 20 cigarettes a pack, seven cartons,
22        1400 cigarettes.  That's today's death toll.
23              Today, while we do this case, from
24        morning to night, 1400 people --
25              MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor. MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- will die --
2              THE COURT:  Sustained.
3              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- from
4        cigarette-related --
5              MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike --
6              THE COURT:  Sustained.
7              MR. GERAGHTY:  -- Your Honor.
8              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  1400 people a
9        day die from cigarettes.
10              MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection -- objection,
11        Your Honor.
12              THE COURT:  I sustain the objection --
13              MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's the evidence.
14              THE COURT:  -- Counsel.
15              MR. SCHLESINGER:  In any event, that
16        represents 1400 cigarettes.
17              So, as Dr. DiFranza said, did nicotine
18        addiction kill Virginia Varner?  Yes.  But for
19        her being addicted to nicotine, would she be
20        alive today with her husband, more likely than
21        not?  You bet.
22              He says:  If she hadn't been addicted to
23        nicotine, she never would have gotten lung
24        cancer.  That's for sure.
25              Let's play this, please. 2     3        follows:)
4              VOICE:  I would say it is just as
5        addictive as heroin or cocaine.
6              Our nation has mobilized enormous
7        resources to wage a war on drugs, illicit
8        drugs.  We should also give priority to the one
9        addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing
10        more than 300,000 Americans each year.
11                (Video clip concluded.)
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  So, back in that period
13        of time, it was said by the Surgeon General
14        Koop at the time -- this is in the '88
15        period -- that tobacco addiction is killing
16        more than 300,000 Americans a year; and he goes
17        on to say, we now understand what -- what has
18        been robbing them of their free choice.  It's a
19        drug.  What's controlling them?  It's a drug.
20              And then this here is the memo -- and
21        this is the memo -- it's in evidence, you'll
22        have it, it's two pages -- and it's from --
23        it's September 9th, 1980, from Kloepfer to
24        Knopick.
25              And these are the folks -- the president and vice president of the Tobacco Institute,
2        one of those lobbying arms, one of the fronts
3        and shields in the conspiracy.  And it's dated
4        September 9th, 1980.  And they say:  We can't
5        defend continued smoking as a free choice if
6        the person was addicted.
7              This is what they were saying internally.
8        This is how they described where they were
9        internally.  But what's interesting about this
10        is, when you read this entire document, which
11        you can --
12              You know, we're giving you snippets, but
13        this will be marked.  It's PT2184.  It will
14        have a folder, it will say "PT2184."
15              If you want to read it, their concern was
16        about a surprise story that the National
17        Institute of Drug Abuse wanted "addictive"
18        added to the cigarette warning, and that
19        cigarette smoking is a -- is a dependence
20        process and cigarette smoking is addictive, and
21        that it was more addictive than using heroin.
22              And -- and they say:  The Tobacco
23        Institute missed a chance to attend and present
24        information at NIDA meeting which was
25        developing the addictive language.  I feel badly about my own lack of
2        intelligence-gathering in this situation, but
3        these questions are not academic.  The lawyers
4        remind us, the entire matter of addiction is
5        the most potent weapon a prosecuting attorney
6        can have in a lung cancer/cigarette case.  We
7        can't defend smoking as free choice if the
8        person was addicted.
9              That was in 1980.  It wasn't even until
10        '88 or '89 where Dr. Koop came out and labeled
11        it addictive.
12              So, for 25 years, after the 1960s, when
13        they said our -- we're in the nicotine delivery
14        business, it's -- the cigarette isn't the
15        product, the cigarette is the package, it's a
16        nicotine-delivery device, the product is
17        nicotine, nicotine is addictive, for over 25
18        years, the Surg- -- the -- the public health
19        authority didn't come out and declare that
20        publicly.
21              And, by that time, the hook sets deep.
22        Folks can be very addicted by that time.  So
23        that's in evidence.
24              All right.  Let me see if I can find
25        this. Okay, yeah, I know where I am.  Let me --
2              Judge, we can take a break right now.
3        I'm at about 45 minutes.  We can take a break
4        right now.
5              THE COURT:  All right.  Ladies and
6        gentlemen, we're going to take our -- a short
7        recess.  Do not discuss the case, don't form
8        any opinion about the case, don't allow anyone
9        to discuss the case in your presence.  Just
10        leave your notepads and the jury instructions
11        on your chairs.  Don't do any research on the
12        case.  We'll be back with you shortly.
13       (Jury exited the courtroom at 10:48 a.m.)
14              THE COURT:  All right.  Let the record
15        reflect the jury has been excused; counsel
16        remain.
17              Now, counsel, subsequent to our
18        discussion sidebar, where I was telling you to
19        take a break, one of the court reporters
20        indicated to me she didn't have to change just
21        yet.  I'm -- I'm trying to figure out when
22        we're going to make this change, so --
[#DELETED RECESS#]
25 proceed.       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you, Judge.
2       All right.  Folks, one thing I skipped
3 over, I must touch on with you so we -- so we
4 are definitive and certain.
5       Despite what you heard in opening
6 statement or any misimpressions it may have
7 conveyed, you must know that in this case, my
8 client, Mr. Varner, did not delay filing his
9 lawsuit in any way, because the case was filed
10 in 1994, just a month after the CEOs testified
11 in Congress down here in Miami.
12       That was the class action.  It worked its
13 way through the courts, and it was --
14       MR. GERAGHTY:  I object, Your Honor.
15       THE COURT:  Sustained.
16       MR. KEEHFUS:  Make a motion.
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  In 2006, the Florida
18 Supreme Court decertified the class and
19 permitted individual lawsuits to be filed
20 within one year of its mandate -- that's the
21 finality, the Supreme Court's final, here's my
22 opinion, we've considered all motions --
23       MR. GERAGHTY:  I object to any --
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- it's final, the
25 mandate.       MR. GERAGHTY:  I object to anything
2 beyond the Court's instruction.
3       THE COURT:  Thank you.
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The mandate is the
5 finality of the Florida Supreme Court's
6 opinion.
7       And it allowed folks from January 11th
8 of 2007, individuals from the class, from
9 January 11th of 2007 until January 11th of
10 2008, 365 calendar days, one year, to file an
11 Engle class lawsuit.
12       This is one of those Engle suits filed in
13 that proper and appropriate time frame.  And
14 for no other reason.
15       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor, I
16 object to counsel's --
17       THE COURT:  Excuse me.
18       Objection is overruled.
19       Counsel, move on.
20       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.
21       So, the choice of defendants to market
22 tobacco known to be both addictive and
23 cancer-causing, raises the question of fault
24 reserved for questions 5 and 6 on the verdict
25 form.       MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object.
2 That's implied preemption.
3       THE COURT:  Overruled.
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Evidence of what the
5 tobacco company manufacturers knew about their
6 deadly product and when they knew it will be
7 important in answering that question.
8       The choice of a youngster, like Virginia
9 Varner, to use tobacco also raises the question
10 of fault reserved for questions 5 and 6.
11       The question of what did she know and
12 when did she know it will have to be addressed
13 by you at that time, but you can't decide at
14 question 1 how much either side should be
15 faulted for their choices to market or use
16 tobacco, because they haven't gotten to
17 questions 5 and 6 yet.
18       MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, statement of law
19 Your Honor.
20       THE COURT:  Overruled.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  So why am I even
22 talking about choice when you haven't reached
23 the fault question on the verdict form yet?
24       Because the tobacco companies want to
25 suggest that Virginia Varner wasn't addicted.       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor, to
2 what we want to suggest.
3       THE COURT:  Sustained.
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  But if you won't buy
5 that nonsense, there is --
6       MR. GERAGHTY:  Excuse me, I object,
7 Your Honor, motion, motion --
8       THE COURT:  Excuse me.  I sustain the
9 objection.
10       Argue the facts, argue the law.  You
11 concern yourself with plaintiff's argument,
12 Counsel.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
14       But if you don't accept that position,
15 there is a fall-back position.  If she was
16 addicted, it was her choice to smoke long
17 enough to get sick; therefore, it was her
18 choice and not her addiction that caused her
19 COPD, her lung cancer, and her death.
20       But not one piece of evidence was
21 presented by either side that Virginia Varner's
22 addiction was her choice.  Nobody chooses
23 addiction.  It's often a terrible side effect
24 of the choice to smoke.
25       Just like the addiction some people get from prescription pain relievers.  No one
2 chooses that addiction.  But it frequently
3 happens as an unintended consequence of the use
4 of the drug.  Lawful, but dangerous drugs, can
5 have awful side effects, side effects like
6 addiction.
7       That's why ordinary people often say
8 about tobacco or prescription pain relievers:
9 Be careful, don't get hooked.
10       Why do people say that?  Because
11 addiction is like a fish getting hooked.  The
12 fish chooses to strike the bait, and then gets
13 caught by the hidden hook.  The hook starts
14 pulling the fish along.  The fish starts
15 fighting the hook and tries to get off.
16       Fish that are only hooked through the lip
17 sometimes get away.  But those who are hooked
18 through the side of the mouth are goners.
19 Fishermen know all this.  It's why they use
20 bait and hooks in the first place.
21       But no fisherman would ever tell you that
22 the fish was caught because the fish chose to
23 get hooked.  The fish died because it didn't
24 see the hook in the first place.
25       High speed lure, this marine -- you don't see the hook.  It's a hidden hook.  It's not
2 meant to be seen.  It's supposed to look like
3 something enticing.  It's not supposed to be
4 something that's going to kill you.
5       The 12-year-old, 13-year-old Virginia
6 Varner certainly did not see the hook.  She
7 died January 1st, '95; 53 years old.
8       The tobacco companies didn't tell their
9 customers that they thought cigarettes were
10 addictive until five years after Virginia
11 Varner died.
12       Instead, they repeatedly told everyone
13 who could read there was a substantial
14 scientific controversy about whether cigarettes
15 were addictive, about whether cigarettes could
16 get you hooked.
17       There was no warning on a cigarette pack
18 until 1966, which wasn't even a warning.  It
19 was a caution.
20       By that time, Virginia Varner was 25
21 years old.  She'd been addicted to smoking for
22 years.  She was hooked.  Hooked badly.
23       She tried to get away, but didn't.  Being
24 hooked eventually killed her.
25       Now the tobacco companies want to tell you being hooked had nothing to do with the
2 death of Virginia Varner.  That's a real fish
3 story, and they know it.
4       MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor --
5       THE COURT:  Sustained.
6       MR. KEEHFUS:  -- motion.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Virginia Varner chose
8 to smoke at a time when no one knew the real
9 dangers of addiction disease inherent in
10 cigarettes.
11       She started as a youth in approximately
12 1954.  The advertising and movies that
13 attracted the young Virginia Varner never
14 mentioned addiction.  Never mentioned cancer.
15       She smoked for over 12 years before the
16 cigarettes even said -- before the cigarette
17 packs even said that cigarettes might -- might
18 be dangerous to your health.  May be, they may
19 not be.
20       Perfect keeping with the doubt campaign
21 voiced upon the American people by tobacco.
22 Over a decade.  In that amount of time, the
23 hook sets deep.  Very deep.
24       Virginia Varner will be pulled along by
25 that hook for more than 40 years.  She tried to fight it, but she didn't get off.
2       Maybe some of you think that she should
3 have tried harder.  That's fair.  But that's
4 questions 5 and 6.  That's fault.
5       Right now, the defendants would suggest
6 that Virginia Varner was never hooked --
7       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor, to
8 what the defendants would suggest.
9       THE COURT:  Sustained.
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  And if you don't accept
11 that, then they would present evidence to
12 suggest that being hooked in no way contributed
13 to her death.
14       Common sense tells us that's not the
15 true, accurate evidence in this case.
16       The reason we all worry about getting
17 hooked is because addiction starts pulling you
18 along, it's hard to get away.  If you don't get
19 away in time, you're dead.
20       That's what happened to Virginia Varner.
21 She didn't get away in time.  And at least one
22 of the important reasons for that was her
23 dependence to the drug nicotine in cigarettes.
24       And that nicotine was a substantial and
25 big factor in why she didn't get away from cigarettes.
2       They ought to know it.  They're the ones
3 that make cigarettes --
4       MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
5       THE COURT:  What is the objection?
6       MR. KEEHFUS:  Attacking defense.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  So not true.
8       THE COURT:  Thank you.
9       Overruled.
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  They're the ones that
11 make the cigarettes with the nicotine hook
12 built right in.  Sustain addiction, initiate
13 addiction, maintain addiction.  You must have
14 precision amounts of nicotine.
15       Now these defendants would offer evidence
16 that that hook has no role in pulling smokers
17 towards disease.
18       That's not believable if you see this our
19 way.  They put nicotine in cigarettes, they
20 keep nicotine in cigarettes, because it keeps
21 their customers hooked.  That way, they'll buy
22 more cigarettes.
23       All the way to the end.  They know that,
24 they want that, they keep the nicotine in their
25 products to keep doing that, getting people hooked.  Just like they hooked Virginia Varner
2 all the way to the end.
3       Freedom of choice?  What did Claude
4 Teague say?  And I invite you to look at all of
5 Claude Teague's critical documents in this
6 case, because he was a brilliant man, and he
7 really captured the essence of the industry
8 with his recognition of the essential role of
9 nicotine, with the urgency to capture the share
10 of the youth market and all smoking begins at
11 youth.
12       His recognition in the '50s when he
13 reported to all his superiors that cigarette
14 smoking caused cancer.
15       But his PT numbers, the Claude Teague
16 documents, some thoughts on the youth market,
17 the crucial role of nicotine.  Read them.  You
18 will see brilliance in action for a nefarious
19 purpose.  But, nevertheless, brilliance in
20 action.
21       What did Dr. Teague say with specificity
22 about whether there was really freedom of
23 choice?
24       This is an internal document from the
25 '70s, when you're addicted.  When you're not a free smoker.  When you're a learner, when
2 you're a confirmed smoker, freedom to choose is
3 a negative.  Because they know you don't have
4 it.
5       Easy as possible to start, hard as
6 possible to quit.  That's the business model.
7       And all throughout, nicotine is
8 addictive.  They have to have the habituating
9 levels of nicotine, they will liquidate their
10 business if they reduce or eliminate nicotine.
11       Without nicotine, there would be no
12 smoking, and very few consumers -- this is
13 Claude Teague again -- very few consumers are
14 aware of the effects of nicotine; for instance,
15 its addictive nature.  It goes on to say, and
16 that it's a poison.
17       Remember when they were trying to come up
18 with ways to see if nicotine was addictive
19 internally in the research, and they said if
20 these results come out that way and it looks
21 like it's just as addictive as morphine, we're
22 going to bury those results and bury that
23 research.
24       Remember Dr. Proctor told you about how
25 many documents they shredded.       So for as many millions as we have and
2 for many lifetimes of careers of scholars to
3 read these tens and 50 or more million
4 documents, Dr. Proctor also reflected on how
5 many were destroyed.
6       This is an industry in the United States
7 doing this to folks.  Remember, they're human.
8 They're judged by you in human terms, but
9 they're also held to human obligations.  If you
10 want to be treated like a person, act like a
11 person.
12       So they controlled the nicotine, they
13 freebase the nicotine.  Everything about it is
14 to make sure it maintains precise levels of
15 control.
16       And this is the explanation:  That
17 different drugs that cause addiction exert
18 their effect in different ways.
19       Dr. DiFranza showed this to you.  The
20 king of dependence, meaning relapse, and
21 keeping smoking, and a lifetime of smoking for
22 four cigarettes.
23       Remember that article that Dr. DiFranza
24 talked about that he used in his studies by
25 Dr. Russell?  The one who said that folks are no more likely -- without nicotine, folks are
2 no more likely to smoke cigarettes than they
3 would be to light sparklers or blow bubbles.
4       Without nicotine, that's how much people
5 would be doing it.  They wouldn't be doing it
6 20 times a day, blowing bubbles and lighting
7 sparklers.
8       Heroin gets you higher, cocaine has a
9 different withdrawal effect.  Alcohol can be
10 terrible delirium tremens.
11       But nicotine -- you can't judge nicotine
12 and a disorder of nicotine about whether or not
13 you can do housework or whether or not you're
14 going to lose your job.  Right?
15       Nobody would want their pilot getting on
16 a plane after spending an hour in the sky
17 lounge knocking back a few White Russians.
18 They wouldn't want him flying that plane.  They
19 wouldn't want to be on a plane flying with a
20 pilot who drank.
21       But nobody would mind getting on a plane
22 with a pilot who smoked a couple cigarettes.
23       And you don't lose your job from smoking
24 cigarettes in the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s,
25 where you can smoke at work, in hospitals. When the doctors smoked with you in the halls.
2 That was a normal process.
3       So we don't have cigarettes here.
4       But in the '80s, there would be
5 cigarettes burning all in the ashtrays in this
6 courtroom.  The judges would be smoking, the
7 lawyers would be smoking, the jurors would be
8 smoking.  That would be perfectly normal.  It
9 wasn't banned, in hospitals or anywhere.
10       So presentism.  Think about the way
11 things were.  And don't substitute the
12 addictive nature of alcohol and what it does to
13 assert its effects, with its intoxicating
14 effects or withdrawal effects, with nicotine,
15 which just makes you do it over and over and
16 over again to keep that nicotine level in your
17 body.
18       The evidence is overwhelming, the greater
19 weight of the evidence, that she was dependent.
20 So question 1 is checked off "yes."
21       And off you move.  And I've spent more
22 time on this part than I wanted to, but off you
23 move.
24       And then the next one is, I told you the
25 two years that mattered.  You will notice there is no such question for Philip Morris, because
2 question 1, Philip Morris, there is no doubt 30
3 years of smoking was definitely a
4 super-important contributor of her being
5 addicted and full of cancer and emphysema and
6 dying.
7       So that's already been determined as a
8 matter of law.  No dispute.
9       However, Reynolds -- and it's reasonable,
10 right, it's reasonable, that Reynolds, with
11 only the beginning of her smoking career and
12 only a couple years, right, 1/20 of her
13 smoking career, that you-all should consider,
14 was it a legal cause; meaning, did it
15 contribute.
16       We believe, we hope that the evidence is
17 sufficient -- particularly from Dr. DiFranza,
18 even Dr. Gup talked about it -- to have you
19 check that off and then they will bear their
20 relative proportion of responsibility from
21 there if you find that the answer to that
22 question is yes.
23       And under it is Dr. DiFranza's answer.
24 And he explained that the cigarettes establish
25 her addiction, she's so young, a stronger addiction.  And did that early role play a
2 significant role in her ultimate disease
3 development and death.
4       And he said it would be a critical
5 factor.  And he is the youth smoking guy.
6 Right?  And he's contributed cutting edge,
7 niche knowledge.
8       It's an honor to bring -- you know, we
9 brought witnesses to you that we hoped honored
10 this process, men of great stature in their
11 professional communities, men of great
12 knowledge and wisdom.
13       And we hope to be able to do that so that
14 we could show you what they did and how they
15 built their career and why they deserved to be
16 giving the kind of opinions and getting some of
17 the kind of, you know, awards that they did.
18       And if they say things like they were
19 against smoking, it stands to reason.  Because
20 a police officer doing his job is against
21 crime.  He's a crime fighter.
22       So saying, well, you believe that smoking
23 is something that should be abolished by,
24 Dr. Proctor, well, it's a clear-minded,
25 rational concept.  That to him, it makes no sense that cigarettes should exist.  They kill
2 over half their users.  That just makes sense.
3       So trying to say that should undermine
4 you or impair your credibility doesn't stand to
5 reason any more than Dr. DiFranza, who sees the
6 scourge of the effect on children and doesn't
7 want it to happen.
8       You know, it's a legitimate, it's a
9 lofty, it's a laudable goal to pursue.
10       These are the instructions.  You've got
11 them.  You'll have them back there with you.
12 But this is as if you found them yourself.
13 These are undeniable findings.  They cannot be
14 denied.
15       This is how we got here.  This is the
16 long journey to justice.  This is --
17       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection; not in
18 evidence, Your Honor.
19       THE COURT:  Excuse me.
20       Objection is noted.  It's overruled.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The findings, the jury
22 decision, the law, the facts, the Supreme Court
23 mandate, and now they're yours.  Now we hand
24 them to you, and we ask you to please use them
25 for all considerations.       After question 1 is answered, for all
2 considerations, is what they did reprehensible?
3 This helps you understand the nature --
4       MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor,
5 statement of the law.
6       THE COURT:  Overruled.  This is argument.
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  They're guilty of
8 fraud, they're guilty of conspiracy.  That's
9 been found.  You all know it.  Dr. Proctor
10 testified about it extensively.
11       It was extremely successful.  They
12 celebrated it.  Twenty years later, said it was
13 a brilliantly conceived holding strategy, and
14 it's helped us win many battles and many
15 victories.  And they were -- they celebrated
16 it.
17       So then we talk about the fraud and
18 conspiracy and how this affects my client, as
19 you're working your way to the punitive
20 damages.
21       And you will see that you have to answer
22 these questions about whether or not the fraud
23 and the conspiracy affected Virginia Varner,
24 one of many millions, one of the folks who did
25 exactly what they expected her to do, behaved exactly like they wanted her to do.
2       She was the perfect smoker.  She was the
3 customer she [sic] wanted.  She was a lifelong
4 smoker.
5       Talking about other members of her family
6 who may have become sick and succumbed to
7 cigarettes in a multigenerational catastrophe
8 is not a successful piece of evidence for the
9 defendants to put on.
10       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
11       THE COURT:  No personal opinions,
12 Counsel.
13       MR. SCHLESINGER:  It speaks to the
14 tragedy of cigarettes.  We talk about harm to
15 others.  The punitive damages instruction says
16 you can consider harm to others.
17       Not only the 20 million who were killed
18 nationwide since the '60s from cigarettes in
19 assessing the degree of wrongfulness of the
20 harm.  But also just the people around that
21 they mention, what about this one and what
22 about this family member?  That's harm to
23 others.
24       So it actually supports the notion of
25 finding them and punishing them if they're telling you that other members of the family
2 got sick from cigarettes.
3       It's a multigenerational catastrophe, and
4 you can consider it that way.
5       So, this reliance, this -- I smoked
6 filters.  Her actions speak louder than her
7 words.  She smoked that which was the
8 psychological crutch, giving the illusion of
9 filtration so you would think there was
10 selective filtration.
11       The Marlboro ads are Selectrate filter.
12       And Mr. Geraghty skillfully asked my
13 client Mr. Varner, saying:  Well, didn't you
14 know that smoke was still coming through those
15 cigarettes when you smoked them?
16       Yeah, but the only thing that he thought
17 was coming through was what the tobacco
18 companies told them was coming through, and it
19 was the fun and the taste and the pleasure and
20 the enjoyment.
21       And these sciencey-sounding filters,
22 which we don't agree there was anything bad in
23 there.  If there is anything bad, we'll find
24 out what it is, we'll take it out.
25       But in the meantime, here is our 20,000 filter traps.  Here is our Selectrate filter,
2 which will selectively remove the bad stuff and
3 only let the fun, the enjoyment, the pleasure,
4 and the taste come through.
5       So Mr. Varner is not supposed to know
6 technically it's a marketing gimmick.
7       So their behavior, their actions speak
8 louder than words.  They fell for the filter
9 fraud, like millions like them, and they relied
10 on this fraud, and it contributed to cause that
11 ongoing smoking.
12       It was the psychological crutch that kept
13 smokers that might be worried.
14       There was no evidence that she was really
15 worried.  She was doing what she thought was
16 normal.
17       Like her son said, Joe, Jr.:  We sat
18 around, we ate dinner, we drank coffee, we
19 watched TV, we smoked cigarettes, we laughed.
20       That was normal.  It was -- you know,
21 sitting here today, if this room was full of
22 smoke, it might not seem that way.
23       And the point is, is that all the
24 information out there, the snowflake in the
25 snowstorm, that the overwhelming message from tobacco was out there.  It was designed to
2        reach populations, of which Virginia Varner was
3        one.
4              It doesn't have to be direct.  It can be
5        circuitous.  As long as they meant to get it
6        out there with the intent that she rely on it,
7        she is entitled to be found to rely, because
8        would it have been important to her?
9              And we'll play this.
10              11           12              follows:)
13        Q.    And then they wanted to also reassure the
14 public that there was no proof of the claims between
15 smoking and lung cancer, correct?
16        A.    They -- they -- they did want that
17 message to get out.  Yes, that's correct.
18              (Video clip concluded.)
19              MR. SCHLESINGER:  So that was their
20        intent.  That's one of the findings.
21              And guess what?  It worked.  It worked.
22        Every cigarette to this day -- almost every
23        cigarette has got a fake filter on it, a
24        marketing gimmick, a scam, a dupe, a dodge.
25        Color-changing filters by Claude Teague with the invention.
2              And it's a hard illusion to break.  An
3        entire country and -- smoking this.  Doesn't do
4        anything.  It doesn't do a thing.
5              That's a heck of a successful illusion,
6        and it kept millions of folks smoking.  And --
7              8           9              follows:)
10              VOICE:  I've been reading a lot about it
11        in the paper, but I don't know anyone actually
12        who has gotten cancer.  Of course the fact that
13        it was smoking, come out and proved in black
14        and white.
15              VOICE:  They come out and really say,
16        well, you're going to get it, I'll stop then.
17        But when they just keep on saying some say you
18        do, some you don't, I'll just keep on.
19              VOICE:  You know they say it causes
20        cancer and heart disease.  Do you believe that?
21              VOICE:  No, I don't.  Not in my heart.  I
22        can't believe it.  If I look back at it,
23        peoples that make the cigarettes, I feel like
24        the one that make the cigarettes should know
25        what they doing. VOICE:  Throughout your tenure with
2        American, it was not only American's position
3        but your position that cigarettes weren't
4        injurious to health.
5              Is that accurate?
6              VOICE:  Through my tenure?
7              VOICE:  Yes.
8              VOICE:  Yes, that is so.
9              VOICE:  That's something American Tobacco
10        wanted the public to believe; is that correct?
11              VOICE:  Yes.
12              VOICE:  It's a statement that American
13        Tobacco placed great reliance on.
14              VOICE:  We issued that statement, yes.
15        We [indiscernible] believe it.
16              VOICE:  As far as you're concerned, a
17        person is justified in relying on that
18        statement.
19              VOICE:  Yes.
20              (Video clip concluded.)
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Reliance goes both
22        ways.  They relied on her relying on them.
23        Like an organic chemistry equation.  It's a
24        balance in equilibrium.  With an arrow going
25        that way, an arrow going that way.  They relied on her reliance and millions like her, and it
2        worked.
3              Think about this.  They made promises
4        they'd stop making it.  They made promises
5        they'd stop making it, if it was ever proven to
6        be bad.  And it certainly has been proven to be
7        bad, but they never stopped making it.
8              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
9              THE COURT:  Sustained.
10              MR. KEEHFUS:  Motion.
11              MR. GERAGHTY:  We join.
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  So we talked
13        about reliance.  There was some testimony about
14        it, about the water turning brown and them
15        thinking that the stuff was coming out that was
16        bad.  You heard that testimony.
17              And what did Dr. Teague say?  Okay?  The
18        public attaches great significance -- remember
19        the color-changing filter trick -- to the color
20        changes.  And even though they said it would
21        have no effect, the advantages and sales
22        advantages are obvious.
23              They believed that that brown stuff
24        coming out of the back of those filters made a
25        difference.  That's reliance.  That's a contribution to that.  They thought they could
2        rely on it.  They thought the bad stuff was
3        coming out.  That's exactly what Teague and
4        everyone else expected.
5              And then -- I'm going to skip this.
6        Okay?  You've heard him, Dr. Cullman.  And,
7        again, a merchandising proposition, the public
8        attaches great significance to the color
9        change.  That's Teague.
10              You can't really selectively filter.
11        We'll tell people:  Here's a triple, quadruple
12        or quintuple filter capable of removing
13        whatever constituents in smoke is suspect.  Oh,
14        and that document, PT036615, ends with "and
15        incidentally, a nice jolt of nicotine."  Don't
16        forget the nicotine.
17              And, of course, the illusion of
18        filtration is as important as the fact of
19        filtration.  That's just the truth of the
20        industry's fraud, deception.
21              Health reassurance fraud, keep people
22        smoking, psychological crutch, and it worked.
23        And they admit they are liars, right here:  We
24        are making false and misleading statements to
25        promote the sale of cigarettes. This was way back in the '60s.  They knew
2        what they were up to.  They didn't care.  They
3        weren't trying to help people.
4              Lies cost lives.  That's one of my ways
5        of saying why things are reliance.  If you lie
6        to people, it results in death.  It causes
7        folks to die.  It causes folks to count on
8        them.
9              The Engle instruction says they made
10        these fraudulent.  They conspired.  They
11        breathed together.  They put forth a fraudulent
12        concealment campaign to keep folks from fully
13        understanding what was going on with the idea,
14        the intent that the public relied.
15              And smoking rates kept going up all the
16        way through the early to mid '80s.  Kept going
17        up.
18              So this is reliance.  Because if lies
19        cost lives, Virginia was one of those lives.
20              Look at all the things they hid from her:
21        That there was never a controversy.  Doubt,
22        that there's all these poisons in the
23        cigarettes.  Hundreds of thousands of people
24        are dying.  Teenagers are the target.  Nicotine
25        is as highly addictive as cocaine and heroin. They manipulate the nicotine, adjust the
2        pH level, add all kinds of additives to make
3        them inhalable and keep them to be addictive
4        and more addictive.  And then filters don't
5        make them any safer.  They didn't know that.
6        Okay?
7              Do I play this one or skip it?  Play it.
8              9           10              follows:)
11              VOICE:  If we do find any that we
12        consider harmful, and so far we have not, we
13        will remove these from smoke and still retain
14        the pleasure of your favorite cigarette.
15              VOICE:  Well, obviously a filter takes
16        out certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think
17        the industry admits there are any bad elements.
18              VOICE:  To claim there is now sufficient
19        scientific evidence to establish that cigarette
20        smoking causes disease is, in my opinion,
21        unjustified.
22              VOICE:  Turning a significant health
23        question into a publicity stunt is an insult to
24        serious science.
25              VOICE:  I cannot point to anything that I would consider the cause of cancer of the lung,
2        but the behavior of the disease does not
3        support the idea of cigarettes being the causal
4        agent.
5              VOICE:  We do not believe that cigarettes
6        are hazardous.  We don't accept that.
7              VOICE:  Do you believe that cigarettes
8        are safe?  Have they been proved to be safe,
9        Mr. Cullman?
10              VOICE:  I believe they have not been
11        proved to be unsafe.
12              VOICE:  The case is still open.  The jury
13        has not come out.
14              VOICE:  It may not be harmful.  We're not
15        convinced.

17        don't know.
18              VOICE:  But insofar as the correlation
19        between lung cancer and cigarette smoking are
20        concerned, no one knows.  It may, it may not.
21              VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause
22        cancer, yes or no?
23              VOICE:  It is not known whether
24        cigarettes cause cancer.
25              VOICE:  All right.  Sir -- VOICE:  Has not been causally
2        established.
3              VOICE:  There is not unanimity of opinion
4        in the community of science on these issues.
5        We have no business prejudging the scientific
6        controversy.  We need more information.
7              VOICE:  Do cigarettes cause cancer?  I
8        don't know if they do or not.
9              VOICE:  I'm not a person to give you a
10        does or does not answer.
11              VOICE:  The data that we have been able
12        to see has all been statistical data that has
13        not convinced me that smoking causes death.  We
14        don't know what causes cancer in general right
15        now, so I think that we may find out what
16        causes cancer, and we may find out some
17        relationship which has yet to be proven.
18              VOICE:  I don't think any of them die of
19        diseases caused by cigarette smoking.
20              VOICE:  Zero?
21              VOICE:  If they do, I think it's an
22        unproven case.
23              (Video clip concluded.)
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Dr. Alexander Spears,
25        CEO of Lorillard, now bought by Reynolds in 1997.  I don't think anybody dies of smoking,
2        and if they do, they still don't.  It's an
3        unproven case.
4              The absolute iron, iron uniformity of the
5        conspiracy as late as 1997.  It's a --
6              And then the big pivot.  They're trying
7        to claim that Virginia Varner should have known
8        what they profess to have not known because of
9        a "may be bad for you" label in 1966, or the
10        Surgeon General said it's hazardous without
11        specificity in 1970?  That doesn't meet with
12        the bounds of reason.
13              And then doubt is the product.
14        Controversy, psychological crutch.  Let's say
15        controversy, contradictions unknown create
16        doubt.  And the industry shield.
17              So we recommend when you get to this part
18        of the -- of the verdict form you find them all
19        to have acted in a way that caused Virginia to
20        rely such that her smoking continued and how
21        things might have been different had they told
22        her the truth; and that they have culpability;
23        and that yes, their fraud and their conspiracy
24        depended upon and succeeded in getting folks
25        like her and Virginia, in particular, to rely. And that includes Reynolds every bit as
2        much as Philip Morris because they are co-equal
3        conspirators, all the acts together in
4        furtherance of the conspiracy.
5              And you heard testimony or statements
6        from lots of people that were the faces of the
7        conspiracy -- the scientists, the executives --
8        all those folks were doing it to get her to
9        rely.  She did.
10              That's how you should answer those
11        questions if you see this our way.
12              Now, this is 5 and 6.  I talked to you
13        about before, and I read you that story about
14        hooked.
15              Was there fault on the part of Virginia
16        Varner which was a legal cause of her lung
17        cancer?  Remember they kept saying she didn't
18        do anything wrong.  She was right to enjoy
19        herself.  She had every right to smoke and
20        these are her personal lifestyle choices and
21        everything else.
22              And so for that reason, while considering
23        whether or not she's at fault, just from what
24        they said, we would say that you check this off
25        "no," she didn't do anything wrong. In the era in which she smoked she acted
2        totally normally.  Not to trump up things like:
3        Did you ever hear -- they asked her:  Hey, had
4        you ever heard of the song Smoke, Smoke, Smoke
5        That Cigarette?
6              And Lisa said:  No.
7              And then the next question was:  Did you
8        ever hear your mom sing the song Smoke, Smoke,
9        Smoke That Cigarette?  Right?
10              Did you ever hear the term "coffin
11        sticks"?
12              No.
13              Did you ever hear your mom use the term
14        "coffin sticks," "cancer nails," "coffin
15        sticks."  Coffin nails, cancer sticks, Smoke,
16        Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette?
17              I don't figure they'll harm me because
18        they haven't hurt me yet.
19              Jokes?  Jokes are what were supposed to
20        supplant trying to help people and telling the
21        truth about a dangerous deadly protect that's
22        too dangerous to market.  That's a defective
23        and unreasonably --
24              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor,
25        legal product. THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Overruled.
2              MR. SCHLESINGER:  A defective -- this is
3        the Engle finding.  As if you found it
4        yourself.  Undenial by the defense.  A
5        defective and unreasonably dangerous finding.
6        When used as intended, it is dangerous.
7              They advertise, they encourage folks:
8        Smoke as much as you can.  Smoke as much as you
9        can.  Save the Marlboro miles.  Save them.
10              Because -- not that it's a road to
11        nowhere.  Because, do you have what it makes --
12        do you have what it takes to make the team?  A
13        road to nowhere.
14              What happens to someone that saves this
15        many pack -- proof of purchase from a pack?
16        They are encouraging you to smoke as much as
17        possible to win valuable prizes?
18              MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, there is no
19        evidence -- motion --
20              THE COURT:  Sustained.
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is --
22              THE COURT:  Excuse me.  You are to rely
23        on your own recollection of the evidence.
24              Counsel, you have ten minutes.
25              MR. SCHLESINGER:  So, if you say:  Hey, by 1982, 1985, okay -- this is how I break it
2        down numerically.  You have to add it to
3        100 percent.  If you find she's not at fault at
4        all, you would break it down 75 percent,
5        25 percent, because they initiated the
6        addiction.
7              But these are my recommendations.  You
8        can adjust these numbers any way you want.  You
9        have to put a zero in for Virginia Varner if
10        you say no.
11              But let's look at this.  Let's say you
12        say:  Wait a second.  Now, we heard a lot about
13        her smoking.  There was a caution on the pack.
14        You know, she should have done better.
15              Well, look here, these are smoking rates.
16        Smoking rates kept going up.  It wasn't until
17        '82, '85, that the new warnings that actually
18        said something specific about lung cancer got
19        on a label, and it wasn't until that much
20        information was out there that the total
21        consumption in the United States started going
22        down.
23              That's the turning point.  That's
24        30 years into her smoking.
25              If you think that 30 years into her smoking, the first 30 years being totally the
2        responsibility of the defendants to confuse the
3        situation, reassure her with filters and her
4        smoking in a normal culture, that would all be
5        their fault.
6              The last 10 percent of her smoking
7        career, the last ten years, if you want to say
8        she bears some responsibility for that so that
9        the last 25 percent of her smoking was such
10        that with the population reducing smoking so
11        too was she careless or negligent or at fault
12        for not starting to or figuring out or getting
13        over her addiction or trying to fight it
14        harder?
15              Well, then, you can assign her some
16        relative degree of responsibility for that
17        period of time forward.
18              But even in that setting, I would say you
19        break it up so that they are more at fault.
20        Because they are doing something on purpose
21        that's wrongful.
22              And she was just -- maybe some human
23        weaknesses, curtailed and constrained by
24        addiction and dependence.  She wasn't doing
25        anything on purpose.  They were doing stuff on purpose.
2              So you could -- if you checked it off
3        "yes" -- because I want to talk to you about
4        this because the defendants will -- then I
5        would break it up like this so that even in
6        those last years, she gets no more than
7        10 percent.  Because the last ten years, one
8        quarter of her smoking history, that's
9        25 percent of it.  They should still get more.
10        They should get 15 of that last 25 percent, and
11        she could get 10 percent if you do that.
12              It would be a great honor for Mr. Varner
13        of vindication if you check off --
14              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, motion.
15              THE COURT:  Sustained.
16              MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, motion.
17              MR. SCHLESINGER:  If the evidence
18        supports it, it would be perfectly appropriate
19        for you to check off "no."
20              They said they accept a basic interest.
21        You saw that.
22              They boycotted the Dow purchases of
23        millions of dollars of material because they
24        didn't want people to stop smoking.  They tried
25        to block people from smoking [sic]. In one of those Cullman videos you may
2        remember at the very beginning he says:  We
3        don't do anything.  We have no program set up
4        to try to help people stop smoking.
5              They weren't trying to help people quit.
6        They never wanted people to get.  They never
7        wanted Virginia Varner to quit.  They were
8        happy to have her smoke and buy those
9        cigarettes because they could make money off
10        her.  That was their job.
11              So I'm going to skip this.
12              VOICE:  Stop worrying about --
13              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And talk about the
14        advertising budget of a quarter trillion
15        dollars and Dr. Proctor saying that the public
16        health message was like a snowflake in a
17        snowstorm.
18              I'm going to skip this.
19              VOICE:  19 --
20              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And don't forget.
21        Dr. DiFranza was good enough at one time -- and
22        you'll see both these brochures in evidence --
23        to be quoted by Philip Morris as being an
24        authority who talked about raising kids who
25        don't smoke and saying:  Don't be afraid to admit to your children that you might have made
2        a different choice had you understood then what
3        you do now.
4              That's in 2000 when they put out a
5        brochure supposedly to show that they're not
6        wanting youth smoking, and they cited
7        Dr. DiFranza.  And then subsequently in the
8        footnote that cited his work, they removed his
9        name.
10              And you look at those brochures side by
11        side and watch how he was good enough for them
12        as an expert, and then they removed his name
13        subsequently.  You look at that.
14              And then, again, importantly, Virginia
15        did not appreciate the dangers of smoking, not
16        like it was demonstrated in this courtroom the
17        modern world understands it.
18              And if you have a caution on a pack of
19        cigarettes, right, like in 1966, and you have a
20        kid, a 12-year-old, and he's standing out on
21        the board of a pool and he's getting ready to
22        jump in the pool and you see a no diving sign
23        there, are reasonable people going to say, if
24        the child is getting ready to run off the end
25        of that diving board into an empty pool:  Go ahead, go ahead?  Or are they going to say:
2        Stop.  Don't go there.  This is dangerous.  A
3        lifetime consequence will occur?
4              So what constitutes the truth and helping
5        people and saying "we did something wrong" and
6        doing something about it makes a big
7        difference.
8              Look at 12 years after she started
9        smoking; 16 years after she started smoking;
10        1985, 31 years after she started smoking.
11        Heavily addicted.  Nonrotating -- the rotating
12        warnings on the side.
13              And then Dr. Proctor talked about what's
14        confusing about this.  It takes years for these
15        poisons to accumulate one puff at a time and
16        kill you.  Unlike if you saw a rattle snake on
17        the side of the road and you know right away
18        that thing could kill you right now with
19        poison.  That's a clear and present threat.
20              Cigarettes, it's seductionism.  Lowering
21        the level of the threat of harm to below what
22        folks would normally appreciate as being
23        immediately dangerous.  That's part of the
24        miracle of its profitability and the scourge of
25        its deadliness to our society. I'll skip this.
2              THE COURT:  Five minutes, Counsel.
3              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yeah.  I'll skip that.
4              So negligence and fault.  I thought we
5        did this.  Okay?  Talk about damages a little
6        bit.
7              And I always run out of time on this.  We
8        spend so much time.
9              But, you know, you heard what they said.
10        I mean one of the more -- you saw him break
11        down with emotion, and the -- I -- there are
12        two things -- there are things that matter and
13        things that don't matter with regard to
14        damages, okay?
15              There are things that matter and two
16        things that don't matter with regard to
17        damages.
18              When you do compensation for the pain and
19        suffering, mental anguish of Joe Varner -- who
20        lost his wife now for over 20-something years
21        and into the future for the next eight or ten
22        years they would have together, if she hadn't
23        died, they had stayed together.
24              The way in which you assess this
25        intangible element of damages is you say you consider -- you consider this evidence.  You
2        measure the magnitude of the harm.
3              And we ask you to say to Joe Varner
4        through your verdict:  We place great value on
5        your loss.  Okay?  And I suggest that that's a
6        $10 million number, for pain and suffering, for
7        mental anguish, for losing his wife of 22 years
8        at 53, who would otherwise be alive.
9              You saw him on the stand.  You judge his
10        demeanor.  You judge the tears down his face.
11        You know he's still hurting from losing her.
12        You know he's going to be buried next to her
13        because he wants to spend life in heaven with
14        her.  You know he wears her cross around his
15        heart.
16              However, there is something that you take
17        away and something you don't take away, because
18        there are two things that matter.  The first is
19        this.  It's relevant and you must consider it.
20        And I want to share it with you.
21              Infidelity is a horrible thing.  There's
22        no sugarcoating it.  If the betrayed leaves, it
23        is justifiable and it is understandable.  If
24        they stay and are able to rebuild in earnest,
25        that is something truly remarkable. The decision is, do we value the
2        relationship by what happened in that horrible
3        moment, or by the years before and, more
4        importantly, by the years afterwards?
5              The easy answer is to make the ugliness
6        into a be-all/end-all and continue the
7        punishment.  But is it the right thing under
8        these special circumstances?
9              If she could forgive him, who are we to
10        hold it against him.  What would she tell you
11        to do?
12              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.  The --
13              MR. GERAGHTY:  Golden rule, Your Honor.
14              MR. KEEHFUS:  Motion.
15              THE COURT:  Sustained.
16              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I suggest you measure
17        the true value of the relationship as she did.
18        Something so treasured it was worth fighting
19        for and hurting for and, in the end,
20        resurrecting to a special place of atonement
21        and fulfillment.
22              That is surely the way he experienced it.
23        The luckiest man alive.  Someone who was given
24        a second chance and treated her as his most
25        precious gift for the rest of their lives together.  You heard him testify about it.
2              And if you want to subtract from the
3        amount of money I suggest -- which, by the way,
4        you can give less, you can give more.  You can
5        think it's too much.  You can think it's not
6        enough.  You can give substantially more.  You
7        can give substantially less.
8              But it is relevant because in a betrayal,
9        in an affair, even if you get back together
10        100 percent, it leaves a mark, it leaves a
11        scar.  It doesn't -- it never -- it doesn't
12        ever really 100 percent heal.
13              So he hurt her, but he atoned.  He
14        offered repentance.  He lived the rest of his
15        life honorably, and he lived the rest of his
16        life to try to show to her that he could be
17        faithful to her.
18              And so it is relevant because it's his
19        pain and mental suffering and anguish.  But
20        this was an impairment during their marriage.
21        But they got back together and but for her
22        death, they would be together today.
23              What is not to be mitigated from the
24        damages, what is irrelevant subtraction -- and
25        we spent very little time on it because it doesn't bear on anything other than you should
2        know the truth.  He had a child a decade later.
3        He got married 12 years later.  He's separated
4        now.  You need to know the truth.
5              But the law does not provide, the
6        instructions do not provide --
7              MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object.
8              MR. SCHLESINGER:  -- for any
9        mitigation --
10              THE COURT:  Excuse me.
11              MR. GERAGHTY:  I object.
12              THE COURT:  What's the objection?
13              MR. GERAGHTY:  It's inconsistent with the
14        Court's instructions.
15              THE COURT:  Overruled.
16              MR. SCHLESINGER:  For any mitigation of
17        the law whatsoever.
18              And that's why I didn't get sucked into
19        it.  Didn't get into a debate.  Because there
20        was nothing to hide.  Now you know, yes, there
21        was a subsequent relationship.  He explained
22        it.
23              But so you understand for damages, there
24        wouldn't have been a subsequent relationship
25        but for her death because of negligence and intentional misconduct.  He would have stayed
2        with her.
3              So the thing that doesn't matter and
4        should not result in we're going to take money
5        away from what we believe is a proper award for
6        pain and suffering and mental anguish and the
7        loss of his beloved wife -- who I heard called
8        the first wife at least eight times during this
9        trial --
10              MR. GERAGHTY:  I object, Your Honor, to
11        the --
12              MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's in the record.
13              MR. GERAGHTY:  -- attacking the way the
14        case has been --
15              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm not attacking --
16              THE COURT:  Counsel, you need to wrap it
17        up.
18              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.
19              And in any event, so yes, you can
20        consider the affair in the context of it -- it
21        is in the marriage and it leaves a mark.
22              So -- but that's -- that's our
23        recommendation.  Ultimately this is up to you.
24        It's an intangible, and we trust the good
25        considerations in all of you. The harm to others as to punitive
2        damages, the death toll matters and deterrence
3        matters because it's not only to punish this
4        company, but to deter others who would act the
5        same way and disregard human life.
6              Numbers numb.  And it's hard to imagine
7        that -- the entire state of Florida has
8        20 million people in it.  20 million deaths
9        would be an empty state of Florida.
10              The defendants keep the exit gates locked
11        and they say right here that they would all
12        lose their jobs and consulting fees and the
13        cigarette market would collapse.
14              20 million people collapsed.  Millions
15        more are sick.  The people collapsed, but they
16        did not want the business and the roaring river
17        of cash of profit to collapse.  And that's
18        inhumane.  They knew they would go out of
19        business if they lost nicotine and addiction,
20        and they don't want that.  That's why I say the
21        numbers numb.
22              And we talked about you could consider
23        the harm to others.  That's why it was relevant
24        that so many of the people get sick and die.
25        And that's why you heard those big numbers. Even though they're hard to imagine.  But they
2        are truly tragic numbers.
3              And then I think we played this already,
4        didn't we?  No, skip this.  Skip it.
5              Okay?  And that's why, when assessing
6        reprehensibility, atrocious misconduct, you
7        say:  Okay.  You're here as a company.  We
8        judge you as being human.  They are humans.
9        Here is their logos.  They are human.  But were
10        they humane?  Did they help people?  Did they
11        try to block addiction.
12              And I say -- I'm going to wrap up now
13        very quickly here.
14              I say what humane companies, people,
15        corporations should do, is to protect children,
16        not addict them.
17              What I say is, men of science and
18        brilliant men who come up with the ingenious
19        ways and novel ways of making this perfect
20        nicotine delivery device should be working to
21        cure cancer, not cause cancer.
22              MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor --
23              THE COURT:  Sustained.
24              MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike; motion.
25              THE COURT:  Jury, disregard.  Stricken. MR. SCHLESINGER:  And I think the
2        evidence showed in this case that it's all
3        about the youth; the critical factor is kids;
4        and that that is something that's very
5        reprehensible, very unacceptable among human
6        decency.  And they even describe them as a
7        crop, and a crop to be harvested.
8              After the 1964 report wore out and sales
9        were skyrocketing again, and the most number
10        one consumer package product in the history of
11        civilization is this, more of these have been
12        sold in the world than anything else ever.
13              And they refer to the youth who they are
14        looking to pick up after the Surgeon General's
15        reports come out, the backlog of youth.  They
16        call them a "crop."
17              And what do you do with a crop?  Van
18        Gogh's famous painting, The Reaper.  A crop is
19        to be harvested.
20              And that's how they refer to their
21        customers, as rats in a cage, as a crop.  This
22        is Claude Teague.  We read this, it's in
23        evidence.
24              And -- to this day, they have not
25        mitigated.  They have not changed.  They're still advertising in ways that reach the
2        message to youth.  Dr. Proctor talked about
3        thousands of youth all the time.  Still
4        smoking.
5              This magazine is in evidence.  It's chock
6        full of advertisings that are very seductive
7        and sultry.
8              The money they say they paid under the
9        Master Settlement Agreement had nothing to do
10        with anything other than reimbursing Medicaid
11        and was a fraction of a fraction of the
12        hundreds of billions of dollars in medical care
13        that Dr. Proctor told you are generated by
14        cigarette diseases and deaths in this country
15        during any given year.
16              They don't advertise truthfully about
17        what really goes wrong with cigarettes.
18              And the jury instructions are what they
19        are.  But you'll decide if it was reckless
20        disregard if they were consciously indifferent
21        to the consequences, if they intentionally
22        violated the rights of humans, and if they
23        disregarded the safety and welfare of the
24        public.
25              The FDA.  They talked about the FDA, and Dr. Proctor explained that they've done
2        nothing, and anything meaningful in public
3        health benefits.
4              And so some folks are disappointed with
5        government agencies, regulatory bodies, and
6        what the efficacy of government is.
7              But -- and I could call it the fail to do
8        anything association, as far as cigarettes --
9              MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object.
10              THE COURT:  Sustained.
11              MR. KEEHFUS:  Motion.
12              MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike and motion.
13              THE COURT:  Jurors, disregard the last
14        comments.
15              Stricken.
16              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thomas Jefferson said
17        that you as a jury, the jurors are the best of
18        all safeguards for the person and property of
19        every individual.  I'd like to say they chose
20        profits over people.  They promised to stop
21        making it, but their fingers were crossed
22        behind their back.
23              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And what would have
25        happened if they had told the truth? What would have happened if they changed
2        their behavior?
3              The world would be a very different
4        place, because the death rate would have
5        changed substantially, and we wouldn't be here
6        because Virginia Varner would.
7              This is the last thing I'll play.
8              9           10              follows:)
11              VOICE:  Do you swear that the testimony
12        you're about to give is the truth, the whole
13        truth, and nothing but the truth?
14              VOICES:  I do.
15              VOICE:  Please consider yourself to be
16        under oath.
17              VOICE:  Let me begin my question on the
18        matter of whether or not nicotine was
19        addictive.
20              Let me ask you first -- and I would like
21        to just go down the row -- whether each of you
22        believes that nicotine is not addictive.
23              I heard virtually all of you touch on it.
24        Just yes or no.
25              Do you believe nicotine is not addictive? VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not
2        addictive, yes.
3              VOICE:  Mr. Johnson?
4              VOICE:  Congressman, cigarettes and
5        nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
6        definitions of addiction.  There is no
7        intoxication --
8              VOICE:  We will take that as a no.
9              Again, time is short.  If you could
10        just -- I think each of you believe nicotine is
11        not addictive.  We just would like to have this
12        for the record.
13              VOICE:  I don't believe that nicotine or
14        our products are addictive.
15              VOICE:  I believe nicotine is not
16        addictive.
17              VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not
18        addictive.
19              VOICE:  I believe that nicotine is not
20        addictive.
21              VOICE:  And I, too, believe that nicotine
22        is not addictive.
23              (Video clip concluded.)
24              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Last thing, and I'm
25        sitting down.  George Orwell wrote a book called 1984.  It was published in the '40s,
2        famous writer, and --
3              MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object.
4        This is not proper argument.
5              THE COURT:  Overruled.
6              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And he -- it was made
7        into a movie with Richard Hurt and -- Richard
8        Burton and John Hurt.
9              And Richard Burton represented big
10        brother, the all-powerful force.  And John Hurt
11        represented the free-thinking man, trying to
12        see things as they are, which is what we ask
13        you to do in this case.  To see things as they
14        are.
15              And Richard Burton was -- or was it John
16        Hurt -- was torturing John Hurt, and he said to
17        him, this.
18              He said:  And above all, we do not
19        allow --
20              MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor, this
21        is not --
22              THE COURT:  Excuse me.
23              Overruled.
24              This is argument, Counsel.
25              MR. SCHLESINGER:  And he said:  And above all, we do not allow the dead to rise up
2        against us.  You must stop imagining that
3        posterity will vindicate you, Winston.
4        Posterity will never hear of you.
5              You will be lifted clean out from the
6        stream of history.  We shall turn you into a
7        gas and pour you into the stratosphere.
8              Nothing will remain of you.  Not a name
9        in a register, not a memory in a living brain.
10        You will have been annihilated in the past, as
11        well as in the future.
12              You will have never -- you will never
13        have existed.
14              Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
15        Virginia Varner existed.  She's 22 years dead,
16        and we've recreated her story as best we can
17        before you over these last couple weeks.
18              We thank you for your attention thus far,
19        and we wish you great, good fortune in arriving
20        at a just and proper decision in this most
21        significant and important case.  Thank you.
22              THE COURT:  Can I see counsel sidebar,
23        please?
24              (The following discussion was held at
25              sidebar:) THE COURT:  Counsel, are you ready to
2        proceed, or do you need a break?
3              MR. GERAGHTY:  I just need like two or
4        three minutes to get started.  I don't know if
5        Your Honor -- does Your Honor want me to go 45
6        minutes and then we'll take the lunch break?
7              THE COURT:  It's your closing argument.
8        I want to give you the opportunity to make a
9        decision how you want to handle it.
10              MR. GERAGHTY:  I appreciate that.  Can
11        Your Honor tell me when I'm at about 30 or 35
12        minutes, and maybe I'll take a break at that
13        point?  I know they don't like to wait too long
14        for their lunch.
15              THE COURT:  All right.  We'll plan on
16        going somewhere around 12:30, around that time.
17        I will wait --
18              Mr. Schlesinger, you went ten minutes
19        over, so we're taking that out of your
20        rebuttal.  Ten minutes.
21              MR. SCHLESINGER:  I thought --
22              THE COURT:  We're not talking about it.
23        You went ten minutes over.  Thanks.



6       MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you, Judge.  May it
7 please the Court.
8       Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
9       JURORS:  Good afternoon.
10       MR. GDANSKI:  Last minutes you get to
11 hear are precious, so I'm going to jump
12 superfast right into it.
13       We've been here for a couple of weeks,
14 and it's pretty clear that some things are in
15 dispute.  Some things are not in dispute.
16       One thing that nobody disputes is that
17 the tobacco industry purposefully,
18 intentionally controls the level of nicotine in
19 cigarettes in order to maintain levels of
20 addiction.  You heard nothing else about it.
21       So forget everything else for one second.
22 Ask this question:  Why are they designing a
23 product continuing to do so until today in such
24 a way that they know has just the right amount
25 of nicotine, just that super, super sweet spot to keep smokers addicted, maintain their
2 addiction, keep them along the path such that
3 they will get sick and die?
4       That's not how you're supposed to design
5 products.  That's not giving people the free
6 choice to quit smoking.  That's not helping
7 people quit smoking.  That's not trying to help
8 save lives.  That's not trying to help prevent
9 disease.  That's not trying to help prevent
10 youth smoking.  That is promoting all of those
11 things.
12       They have created an epidemic in this
13 country heretofore unknown in the history of
14 society.  There's no two ways about it.  There
15 was no other version of that story.  It was
16 just kind of ignored by those who manufactured
17 it.
18       How can we sit on the sidelines and watch
19 them massively create death and destruction and
20 sort of just pretend it hides in plain sight
21 and doesn't exist?
22       And Dr. Proctor talked about -- and
23 Mr. Schlesinger said it, Scott said it -- he
24 said that conspiracy means to breathe together.
25 And what exactly does that mean? So they breathe an epidemic together,
2 they breathe a conspiracy together.  The
3 smokers inhale the conspiracy.  As they're
4 doing that, one side is profiting, one side is
5 growing, one side is getting stronger and
6 stronger, and one side is slowly losing their
7 breath, dying slowly to the tune of thousands,
8 hundreds of thousands, millions.
9       And it goes on.  It goes on just like
10 that.  And then something happens.  Those folks
11 who are dying, those folks who are smoking,
12 they die.
13       And so what does the industry do?
14       I need help, buddy.
15       What does the industry do?  They put in
16 place a mechanism to create replacement
17 smokers.  So they know they're going to die.
18 What are we going to do?  We can't have them
19 die because if younger adults turn away from
20 smoking, the industry must decline.
21       Now that is not an acceptable
22 proposition.  That's not something that can be
23 entertained.  That's not something that can be
24 appreciated.  It must be avoided at all costs.
25 It must be avoided to the cost of just as a population which does not give birth will
2 eventually dwindle.
3       So replacement smokers are their
4 children, but they keep on killing them.
5 Virginia Varner, a replacement smoker.  Her
6 mother -- we've heard more in this case about
7 her mother's emphysema from Mr. Geraghty than
8 we've heard about her lung cancer, Virginia's
9 lung cancer, and her emphysema that we heard
10 from Mr. Geraghty.
11       MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object.
12       THE COURT:  Sustained.
13       MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
14       THE COURT:  Jurors disregard.
15       MR. GDANSKI:  Virginia Varner is a
16 replacement smoker.
17       You heard testimony her kids smoke.  They
18 will be replacement smokers.
19       But they go on.  They don't just replace
20 the use.  They don't just replace those who
21 die.  They profit from them.  They monetize
22 them.  They study them.  Not to the tunes of
23 millions of dollars, not to the tunes of
24 thousands of dollars, billions and billions of
25 dollars. They say here that if we have an
2 aggressive plan, it will call for $442 million
3 profit during the plan period.  However, if we
4 hold these -- remember the code words that were
5 used, YAS, young adult smokers -- for the
6 market average of seven years, they would be
7 worth over $2.1 billion in aggregate
8 incremental profits.
9       These are their words discussing the
10 profitability, the monetization of children.
11       That is reprehensible.  That is
12 abhorrent.  It is unacceptable, and it should
13 not be tolerated even the tiniest little bit.
14       You know, we talked about mitigation.  So
15 in 1950, you had Elizabeth Taylor on the cover,
16 and in 2008 or '12, you have Rose from the
17 Transformers with One Direction.
18       This is not mitigation.  They couldn't
19 have more tobacco advertisements in this
20 magazine than they do.  It's advertised in this
21 magazine to a greater degree than any other
22 product.
23       So how far have we come?  How far have
24 they let society come?  Not very far at all.
25 Because a powerful industry, a powerful industry --
2       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
3       THE COURT:  Sustained.
4       MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
5       THE COURT:  Jurors disregard the last
6 comment.
7       MR. GDANSKI:  This industry depends on
8 the perpetuation of this epidemic.  They cannot
9 see it go down.  They will keep it going
10 because nicotine, young adult smokers --
11       MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, there is no
12 evidence of any of this.  I will object.
13       THE COURT:  Overruled.  Ladies and
14 gentlemen, you rely on your own recollection of
15 the evidence.
16       MR. GDANSKI:  Nicotine and children are
17 their lifeblood.  They are their sine qua non.
18 Without children, without replacement smokers,
19 without nicotine, they would have no business,
20 the exit gates would open, it would be the end
21 of days for them, and they don't let it come.
22       Dr. Proctor talked about the current
23 state of affairs.  Every single day in this
24 country 3,800 children start smoking.  1,000 of
25 them become regular daily smokers.  500,000 deaths per year right now.  1,400 people die
2 from smoking every single day.
3       How many more?  There's a song that has a
4 refrain, How Many More, by Neil Young.
5       MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would
6 object.
7       THE COURT:  Overruled.
8       MR. GDANSKI:  How many more, how many
9 more will there be?
10       Dr. Proctor said in 100 years smoking
11 will be gone.  Maybe, maybe not.  But we're not
12 there; we're now.  500,000 1,400, 3,800 --
13 massive, mind-staggering statistics that you
14 need to take a step back.  Because if you don't
15 take a step back and sort of get the big
16 picture, the numbers start to just become:  Ah,
17 a lot of people die from cigarette smoking.
18       That's not how it is.  Parents are dying.
19 Sisters are dying.  Brothers are dying.  Aunts,
20 uncles, grandparents, loved ones.  They leave
21 widows; they leave orphans.  We don't exist in
22 a perfect world, but they leave real people
23 behind to suffer real sorrow with real tears
24 and real emotions.
25       There was one episode in this trial that portrayed a moment of just sort of reality of
2 Mr. Varner where he said:  I go to my wife's
3 grave.  And he's there by himself, and in a
4 moment of silence and solitude, he cleans the
5 weeds from her graveside.
6       That's real.  That's not pretend.  It's
7 not fake.  It's real care.  It's real emotion.
8       His son said he saw him do it.  It's
9 someone who cherished his wife, cherishes her
10 still to this day, and it's a snapshot of the
11 mind frame and the caring nature that a husband
12 has for their longtime wife, their true love,
13 their soul mate, the person they met as a kid
14 and intended on living the rest of their life
15 with.
16       He gets down on his hands and his
17 knees -- he's not a young fellow.  Gets down on
18 his hands and his knees and cleans her
19 graveside.  That's admirable.  It's admirable.
20       So this is Dr. Gup's note from 8/22/1994.
21 And let's just give a little bit of context.
22       Dr. Gup here has confirmed the diagnosis
23 of lung cancer, he's confirmed the diagnosis of
24 COPD, he's confirmed the diagnosis of tobacco
25 addiction, and he carries all of those over to this date.  And he documents Virginia Varner as
2 of 8/22, so August 22nd, 1994, as a smoker.
3       This is her still smoking.
4       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, that's
5 inconsistent with the evidence, Your Honor.
6       THE COURT:  Thank you.
7       Ladies and gentlemen, you are to rely on
8 your own recollection of the evidence.  This is
9 counsel's opportunity to go through the
10 evidence as he recalls it.
11       Go ahead, Counsel.
12       MR. GDANSKI:  This is the organic medical
13 record created at the time.  Still smoking a
14 pack a day.
15       And before this, when Dr. Gup first met
16 Virginia Varner, he never noted a history of
17 lung problems, he never noted a history of
18 significant medical problems, he never noted
19 any of those things.
20       This is his history taken from the person
21 who no one in this room ever got to speak to,
22 except for her husband.  This is taken from
23 Virginia Varner.  This is what she told him,
24 not courtroom deposition testimony with
25 impeachment, but this is real testimony. And we know there's a proverb that says:
2 The palest ink is far brighter than the best
3 memory.
4       This is ink.  This is pen to paper in a
5 medical record, Broward County Hospital, that
6 actually demonstrates what took place.
7       There is no reference to history of
8 wheezing.  There is no reference to history of
9 significant medical problems.
10       But take one step back for a second.
11 They want to claim that Virginia Varner had
12 this wheeze going back to the mid '80s.  Let's
13 just assume she did for a second.  They also
14 want to claim that she smoked despite that for
15 a second.  Isn't that a sign of addiction?  Did
16 they ever explain that, though?
17       If you have a person who suffers from a
18 wheeze that is associated with a product and
19 they continue to use the addictive product
20 which caused the wheeze, do you think that's
21 probably evidence of the person probably being
22 addicted?  Which is the burden of proof that's
23 relevant in this case, what is most likely?
24 What's probable?
25       Is it probable that if a person uses an addictive drug for 40 years, they get sick as a
2 consequence of using that addictive drug, that
3 they were probably addicted to that drug?
4       Does that stand to reason?  Does that
5 make logical sense?
6       We submit to you that it does, and that
7 is dispositive of multiple issues in this case.
8       Dr. DiFranza.  Dr. DiFranza is a no-joke
9 expert.  There is no real two ways about that.
10 Whether or not you want to say he's treating
11 the most patients or some patients or whatever
12 you want to say about Dr. DiFranza,
13 Dr. DiFranza is a serious expert.
14       And he came in here and he told you that
15 addiction was "a cause" of Virginia Varner's
16 lung cancer, COPD, and death.  "A cause."
17       Remember that because it is important.
18 When you get back with the jury instructions --
19 and they are superdense.  The jury instructions
20 are complicated.  They take up time to
21 understand.  There is a very big difference
22 between something being "a cause" and "the
23 cause."
24       But Dr. DiFranza told you in no uncertain
25 terms, addiction was a contributing cause of her disease.
2       Now, before these lawsuits, Dr. DiFranza
3 was Philip Morris's expert.  They paraded him
4 around when they wanted to try to put out
5 brochures --
6       MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, that's
7 inconsistent with the evidence.
8       THE COURT:  Thank you.
9       Ladies and gentlemen, again, you are to
10 rely on your own recollection of the evidence.
11       MR. GDANSKI:  It's right here.  This is:
12 Raising kids who don't smoke.  It's PT425 from
13 2004.
14       We all heard that the Engle progeny cases
15 developed in 2006.  Your Honor -- I think the
16 Court read that instruction.  That's when the
17 Florida Supreme Court came out with its
18 opinion.  The mandate, one year later.
19       So in 2004, before this evolution of
20 litigation against the industry, Philip Morris
21 was proudly, publicly citing Dr. DiFranza --
22       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection.
23       THE COURT:  Sustained.
24       MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike,
25 Your Honor. THE COURT:  Thank you.
2       Ladies and gentlemen, again, you are to
3 rely on your own recollection of the evidence.
4 I sustained the objection.  It's stricken.
5       MR. GDANSKI:  Philip Morris cited
6 Dr. DiFranza as their expert in raising kids
7 who don't smoke in 2004.  The citation was
8 number 6, discussing symptoms of addiction.
9       So on the question of symptoms of
10 addiction, they cite him for the proposition
11 that teens and preteens can have symptoms
12 within weeks or only days after they become
13 occasional smokers.
14       It makes sense they would cite him on
15 that for two reasons.  Number one is, he is an
16 expert on addiction.  Number 2 is, he's a
17 specialist in youth smoking.  That's what he's
18 devoted his life to.
19       So they cite him right there, number 6 in
20 evidence.  And then a couple of years later,
21 the second version of this comes out, and they
22 take him right off.
23       Now, we know that the industry internally
24 had documents where they discussed what would
25 happen if there were methods to stop smoking? What would happen if there were methods to help
2 people cessate from smoking?
3       And they say here in PT1154:  It is my
4 strong feeling that with the progress that has
5 been claimed, we are in the progress [sic] of
6 digging our own grave.
7       They were not comfortable continuing
8 research that led to them digging their own
9 grave.  Instead, they were very comfortable,
10 very comfortable letting the graves be dug for
11 thousands and hundreds of thousands --
12       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
13 Move to strike.  I have a motion.
14       THE COURT:  Thank you.
15       Jurors, disregard the last comment.
16       Stricken.
17       MR. GDANSKI:  I asked Dr. Proctor about
18 anthropomorphizing, which means keeping the
19 company alive and the smoker something else.
20       And they did that here:  We don't want to
21 die.  They say this while thousands of
22 Americans are dying.
23       Dr. Proctor.
24       Dr. Proctor is a scholar on the subject
25 of the tobacco industry.  They never one time took out his book and said to him:  Well, you
2 know, you wrote something different in this
3 book.  That's different than what your
4 scholarly research shows.
5       No, there's no two sides to it.  But this
6 is a mousetrap.  There is a proverb that says:
7 Build a better mousetrap, and the world will
8 beat a path to your door.
9       Build a better mousetrap.  He built a
10 better mousetrap.  He became -- he went to
11 Harvard and Stanford and teaching and studying
12 and studying and reading and researching and
13 publishing.
14       He became a major significant expert.
15 The Surgeon General cites him over 30 times.
16 He's at the White House for the introduction.
17 The FDA brings him to Washington, D.C.  He
18 distinguished himself as an expert in the
19 subject.
20       We need to find someone to teach jurors
21 about that subject.  Who are we going to go to?
22 We're going to go to the person who built the
23 better mousetrap, because he has paved a path
24 to his door.
25       We come to him for his expertise.  And to suggest anything otherwise is disingenuous.  He
2 is a top scholar --
3       MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
4       THE COURT:  Sustained.
5       MR. KEEHFUS:  Motion.
6       MR. GDANSKI:  Dr. Proctor is the top
7 scholar on this subject in this country.  He
8 knows more about it than almost anybody else.
9       We heard about Reader's Digest.  The
10 tobacco industry hated Reader's Digest.  They
11 couldn't stand when they were putting out
12 articles.
13       And what did they do?  They successfully
14 refuted Reader's Digest.
15       We put it into evidence, 2027,
16 successfully refute Reader's Digest.  Because
17 they could not appreciate, they couldn't stand
18 for the message Reader's Digest was putting
19 out.  Why?  Because the industry didn't want
20 people to stop smoking.
21       Same thing when Dow, Nicorette tried to
22 help people for the first time have a medical
23 mechanism to stop.  They said:  No way.
24       Filtered cigarettes, there is this
25 concept being brought up by counsel -- defense counsel over and over again that the Varners
2 always smoked filters.  And so if you always
3 smoked filters, then they saw bad stuff in
4 filters.  I'm not sure I understood it, but
5 here's where --
6       MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object,
7 Your Honor, to the commentary about the
8 arguments.
9       THE COURT:  Overruled.
10       MR. GDANSKI:  Here is what Dr. Proctor
11 explained about filters.  He explained that the
12 Surgeon General, the public health community
13 for decades recommended smokers smoke filters.
14       And then he said in 2001, they switched
15 that recommendation because of the revelation
16 of the internal documents.
17       And he talked about the fact that the
18 public health community, the Surgeon General,
19 the American Cancer Society were misled by --
20       MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
21       MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is not in
22 evidence.  Hearsay.
23       THE COURT:  Thank you.
24       Counsel.  Sustained.
25       MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike, Your Honor.
2       THE COURT:  Jurors, disregard the last
3 comments.
4       MR. GERAGHTY:  And I have a motion.
5       THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, you are
6 to rely on your own recollection of the
7 evidence.
8       MR. GDANSKI:  Dr. Proctor said:  And
9 exactly as you said, the Surgeon General
10 recommended filters.  They would all say it's
11 best not to smoke at all.  But if you must
12 smoke, smoke filters, believing they were
13 safer.
14       So it was not an uncommon -- uncommon
15 for -- even among leading public health
16 officials for decades to make the mistake that
17 filters were safer.
18       Then he discussed in 2000, after the
19 revelation of the documents, the consensus
20 turning around.
21       And if the Surgeon General and the public
22 health community got it wrong and the tobacco
23 industry knew internally, what chance did
24 Virginia Varner have?  What chance did she
25 have? The Surgeon General couldn't get it
2 right.  Took him 30 years to get it right.
3 What chance did she have?
4       Mr. Geraghty said that Joe Varner, Jr.
5 hemmed and he hawed.  He didn't hem and haw.
6       Can you play it?
7       This is the question from -- one of you
8 asked this question.  This is it.  Let's take a
9 look.
10       We need some volume.  Do it again.
11       Try it one more time.  Then I'm going to
12 move.  If we get it, we'll come back to it.
13       Okay.
14       Mr. Geraghty said in opening statement
15 and again today:  We are not going to dispute
16 that some of our employees said stupid or
17 inappropriate things over time.  And that is
18 too little, too late.
19       MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object
20 to the comment.
21       THE COURT:  Sustained.
22       MR. GDANSKI:  It is not about --
23       MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike.
24       THE COURT:  Jurors, disregard the last
25 comment. MR. GDANSKI:  It is not about what is
2 said now in 2016.  It is about what was said
3 and what was done while Virginia Varner was
4 alive.  That is what it is about.  And we know
5 that they -- I'll get back to it.
6       Okay.  We'll do it now.
7       8    9       follows:)
10       THE COURT:  I will read the question out
11 loud.  And if I correctly stated the question,
12 then I'm going to ask you to answer it.  All
13 right?
14       The question reads as follows:  Did
15 Mrs. Varner first -- or, excuse me -- when did
16 Ms. Varner first tell you she wanted to quit
17 smoking?
18       Did I correctly state your question?
19       VOICE:  Yes.
20       THE COURT:  Can you answer that, please?
21       THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure exactly, a
22 date or anything like that.  But I've heard her
23 say it quite a few times, you know -- as I was
24 growing up or whatever, even before -- probably
25 even before I was smoking. But, honestly, I don't know, you know,
2 how old I was or how old she was.  I don't
3 remember.
4       THE COURT:  Does that complete your
5 answer, Mr. Varner?
6       THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.
7       (Video clip concluded.)
8       MR. GDANSKI:  That's candid.  He said she
9 tried to quit probably before he was even
10 smoking.  No hemming, no hawing.  Strictly
11 upfront.  Answered the question.  He told his
12 answer as best as he possibly could.
13       Now, it's not about what is said in court
14 today from tobacco company attorneys.  It's
15 about what they did.
16       But the documents also reveal something
17 else.  They don't just reveal what they did.
18 They reveal why they did it, what they were
19 scared of, what they were terrified of.
20       And we know at least two things were
21 really in their mind that they were afraid of:
22 Lawyers and lawsuits.  Lawyers and lawsuits.
23       THE COURT:  Five minutes, Counsel.
24       MR. GERAGHTY:  I object and move to
25 strike, Your Honor. MR. GDANSKI:  We have here --
2       THE COURT:  Excuse me.  There is an
3 objection pending.
4       Sustained.
5       MR. GDANSKI:  We have here 1963 from a
6 law firm representing tobacco companies.
7       They said then:  As we frequently
8 discussed with the passing of time, the
9 defenses of assumption of risk -- Dr. Proctor
10 explained that means it's all their fault --
11 defenses of assumption of risk and contributory
12 negligence will loom increasingly more
13 important.
14       So they knew it was going to loom as a
15 defense.
16       Yet the validity -- the validity of these
17 defenses is being whittled down by tobacco
18 company utterances, to the effect that there's
19 no risk or that it is remote.
20       They knew in 1963 that what they said
21 publicly made a difference to what people were
22 doing.  They knew that.
23       24    25       follows:) VOICE:  It's equally ridiculous in your
2 judgment for the Surgeon General and the U.S.
3 Public Health Service and the Centers for
4 Disease Control, it's equally ridiculous and
5 preposterous for them to say that 450,000
6 Americans die every year as a result of
7 cigarette smoke.
8       VOICE:  I think it's totally
9 unsupportable.
10       (Video clip concluded.)
11       MR. GDANSKI:  The history of the
12 documents reveal why this was maintained as the
13 ultimate denial.
14       Lest some lawyer be looking over our
15 shoulder, I do not conceive that even one
16 person dies of a chronic disease that is caused
17 by smoking cigarettes.  Sauce for the goose is
18 sauce for the gander.  That is all I'm saying.
19       We know that this is the real truth.
20 This is the secret reason, the real reason.
21       In this case, there is no dispute --
22 everyone should understand this, there is no
23 dispute that smoking cigarettes caused Virginia
24 Varner's death.  None.
25       We know, though, that internally, in 1978, there are documents that an admission by
2 the industry that excessive cigarette smoking
3 is bad for you is tantamount to an admission of
4 guilt with regard to the lung cancer problem.
5       This -- and when they say "this," they
6 are referring to this idea that smoking
7 actually hurts people -- this could open the
8 door to legal suits in which the industry would
9 have no defenses.
10       So we know from a document
11 Mr. Schlesinger talked about, lawyers remind us
12 we can't defend continued smoking as free
13 choice if the person was addicted.
14       Here, this could open the door to legal
15 suits in which the industry would have no
16 defense.
17       One of the things that was discussed was
18 Ms. Varner, Virginia Varner, saying:  I'm going
19 to get sick in 1992.  She was prescient.  She
20 had a sense.
21       In 1992, it was too late.  Had she
22 stopped, she's still doomed.
23       However, now, it's not too late.  Think
24 about this.  When they knew --
25       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Overruled.
2       MR. GDANSKI:  When they knew smokers were
3 going to die.
4       So she says:  I know -- she says that
5 it's -- I'm going to die anyway.  Well, flip it
6 on its head.  They knew smoking was dangerous,
7 and what did they do.  They said:  We're going
8 to kill them anyway.
9       MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection.
10       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection.
11       THE COURT:  Sustained.
12       MR. GERAGHTY:  Motion, Your Honor.
13       THE COURT:  Jurors, disregard.
14       Counsel, you need to wrap it up.
15       MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.
16       There is a quote from a famous author
17 named Saul Bellow, which says:  A great deal of
18 intelligence -- and the folks who worked for
19 tobacco companies were smart -- a great deal of
20 intelligence can be invested in ignorance when
21 the need for illusion is deep.
22       They had a deep need to create illusion.
23 They did it by the manufacturing of ignorance.
24 And Virginia Varner unquestionably paid the
25 price.  She paid the ultimate price.  The eternal price.  She paid the forever price.
2       What price have they paid?
3       MR. KEEHFUS:  Objection, Your Honor.
4       MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection, Your Honor.
5       THE COURT:  Thank you.
6       Overruled.
7       MR. GDANSKI:  Thanks very much, ladies
8 and gentlemen.  Thank you.
