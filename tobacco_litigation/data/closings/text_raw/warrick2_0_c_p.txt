 2            MR. SHIELDS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 3            We were talking about all of the massive
 4       documentary evidence about their denials and
 5       misrepresentations and concealment that cigarettes
 6       caused cancer.
 7            There's another aspect of that as well, and
 8       that is their denials that cigarettes were addictive
 9       long after they knew they were addictive and they
10       were internally researching how to manipulate the
11       content of cigarettes to make them more addictive.
12            One of the documents we have shown to you is a
13       1969 report from one of the premier researchers --
14       you've heard his name time and time again from
15       Philip Morris -- Dr. Wakeham, in a presentation that
16       he made to the Philip Morris board of directors.
17            Now, you may have had this implication from
18       time to time from the defense, that it's a scientist
19       here and a scientist there and they're not really
20       speaking for the company.  This is the presentation
21       to the board of directors of their corporation, the
22       top people that run the company.
23            And what this document indicates is their clear
24       understanding of why people smoke and how to keep
25       them smoking.

 1            They start by recognizing that they get smokers
 2       to begin with when they're children, when they're
 3       teenagers, and that they start smoking as teenagers
 4       for reasons that have nothing to do with nicotine or
 5       the cigarettes but have to do with glamorizing them,
 6       feeling like they're an adult, for all of these
 7       psychosocial reasons.  That's why children begin to
 8       smoke.
 9            We're all going through -- all have gone
10       through that adolescence process, and that's what
11       happens.  And they fully understood that.  But how
12       do you keep them smoking after that point in time?
13            What this document recognizes is that their
14       understanding of how you keep them smoking is their
15       addiction to nicotine.
16            This was not only recognized in this document
17       to the board of directors, but they undertook a
18       massive internal investigation by Dr. Dunn.
19            The next document about nicotine's
20       addictiveness and the incentive to keep people
21       smoking by manipulating nicotine.
22            You're going to have all of these documents. 23       It's a lot of documents to look through.  It's a
24       pretty massive pile over here.  And among those you
25       will have this document that clearly indicates their

 1       understanding that the way you keep people smoking
 2       is the nicotine content.
 3            And as Dr. Farone testified to you -- remember
 4       Dr. Farone.  He was at Philip Morris.  He was one of
 5       their internal scientists.  And he told the truth
 6       and said, "We all knew that cigarettes caused cancer
 7       and we all knew that nicotine was addictive.  And we
 8       manipulated the content of cigarettes to make sure
 9       that people continued to smoke because of their
10       addictiveness."
11            That fact is set out by a rather important
12       admission made in 1963 in a document that you will
13       have, marked strictly "Private and Confidential,"
14       in which "There is a candid and clear admission,
15       moreover, nicotine is addictive.  We are then in the
16       business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug."
17            That's the truth that they knew clearly by the
18       early '60s, if not before that.  But they united.
19       Finally in 1988 the Surgeon General of the United
20       States, he issued a massive report -- one of those
21       documents you'll have over there -- that goes
22       through all the evidence that nicotine is addictive,
23       that it's similar to cocaine, that it's similar to
24       heroin addiction, and they responded by denying it.
25            Here's the evening news from the day that

 1       Surgeon General's report was issued.
 2            (A video clip was played and transcribed by the
 3   court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:)
 4            ANNOUNCER:  "The smoking war escalated today.
 5       A new report from the Surgeon General of the United
 6       States added a weapon for people who oppose smoking
 7       and their representatives in Congress.  It also drew
 8       fire from the tobacco industry.  Medical
 9       correspondent Susan Spencer reports."
10            SUSAN SPENCER:  "Surgeon General Koop drew his
11       smoking gun on the tobacco industry today, declaring
12       what a lot of people who can't kick the habit
13       already know:  The nicotine in cigarettes is
14       addictive, very addictive."
15            SURGEON GENERAL KOOP:  "I would say it is just
16       as addictive as heroin or cocaine.  Our nation has
17       mobilized enormous resources to wage war on drugs,
18       illicit drugs.  We should also give priority to the
19       one addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing
20       more than 300,000 Americans each year."
21            SUSAN SPENCER:  "Anti-smoking groups said this
22       report puts their fight on a new footing."
23            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "Because a finding that
24       smoking is addictive knocks out the tobacco
25       industry's number-one argument, that is, that

 1       smokers smoke because of their freewill."
 2            SUSAN SPENCER:  "Others said the official
 3       finding that smokers are addicted may actually help
 4       them quit."
 5            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "People should be
 6       encouraged.  Now we know what the nature of the
 7       beast is that's been controlling them.  It's a  8       drug."
 9            SUSAN SPENCER:  "As expected, The Tobacco
10       Institute called today's report unwarranted, saying
11       that since people do quit smoking, tobacco clearly
12       isn't addictive.
13            "In response, the Surgeon General noted that
14       some people also get off heroin.
15            "Susan Spencer, CBS News, Washington."
16            (The video clip was ended.)
17            MR. SHIELDS:  Now, you saw the reference in
18       that report to the number of people that die each
19       year from tobacco, 300,000.  Recall that Dr. Burns
20       testified later than it was close to 440,000.  Why
21       is that?  That's because in the year since 1988 more
22       people die each year from cigarette smoking,
23       primarily because of the number of women that
24       started smoking and the long lag between when
25       starting smoking and when cancer finally occurs to

 1       return to the addictiveness.
 2            They not only denied it following the Surgeon
 3       General's report saying it was an irresponsible
 4       scare tactic -- and you'll have that document -- a
 5       few years later in 1994 they were compelled by
 6       subpoena to appear before a Congressional committee
 7       and required, as you saw witnesses here, to take an
 8       oath that they would tell the truth, the whole truth
 9       and nothing but the truth under penalty of perjury.
10            And each of the presidents of the tobacco
11       companies, including the president of Philip Morris
12       and including the president of R.J. Reynolds, stood
13       up under oath and said tobacco and nicotine was not
14       addictive, despite the fact that all of their
15       internal documents going back 30-some years showed
16       to the contrary, not only that they knew it but they
17       were internally researching how to make the
18       cigarettes more addictive by manipulating the
19       content of nicotine.
20            Let's take a look at their testimony.
21            (A video clip was played and transcribed by the
22   court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:)
23            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "Let me begin my
24       questioning on the matter of whether or not nicotine
25       is addictive.  Let me ask you first -- and I'd like

 1       to just go down the row -- whether each of you
 2       believes that nicotine is not addictive.  I heard
 3       virtually all of you touch on it.  And just yes or
 4       no.
 5            "Do you believe nicotine is not addictive?"
 6            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "I believe nicotine is
 7       not addictive, yes."
 8            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "Mr. Johnson?"
 9            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "Congressman, cigarettes
10       and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
11       definitions of addiction.  There is no
12       intoxication" --
13            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "We'll take that as a
14       no.  And again, kind of short, if you can just -- I
15       think each of you believe nicotine is not addictive.
16       I just would like to have this for the record."
17            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "I don't believe that
18       nicotine or our products are addictive." 19            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "I believe nicotine is
20       not addictive."
21            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "I believe that nicotine
22       is not addictive."
23            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "I believe that nicotine
24       is not addictive."
25            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "And I, too, believe

 1       that nicotine is not addictive."
 2            UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  "All right."
 3            (The video clip was ended.)
 4            MR. SHIELDS:  Those denials weren't just on
 5       C-SPAN, as Mr. Reilly told you in opening statement,
 6       but the evening news covered that very testimony of
 7       all the networks.
 8            And the major story in all the newspapers the
 9       following day was that the cigarette company
10       presidents denied that nicotine was addictive.
11            And they continued that denial until 2000,
12       following the first Engle trial, when they finally
13       admitted on their Website.
14            Now, what is the contrary evidence to all that
15       I've been telling you, about their long campaign of
16       denial and deceit and misrepresentation and fraud
17       and concealment?  Was there any evidence they
18       presented you denying anything that Dr. Proctor said
19       or Dr. Burns said or Dr. Goldberg said?
20            The only evidence they offered was from
21       Mr. Jupe.  Despite all of their internal scientists
22       and corporate executives and people that had denied
23       over the years, didn't bring a one of them to
24       testify.  Didn't bring a one of them to say, "Here's
25       why I said it and here's what I meant."

 1            Instead they brought somebody that didn't even
 2       come to work for them until 1995 and who claimed on
 3       that witness stand that he hadn't read or seen any
 4       of the documents, despite the fact that he's asked
 5       deposition after deposition about them, including by
 6       me less than two months ago when he also denied, as
 7       he admitted on the stand, that he had read the
 8       documents.
 9            And he was shown the documents and required to
10       read them.  And he comes into court two months later
11       and says, "Oh, I've never read these."  Why do you
12       think it is that they put on a witness and they
13       never have him read all of the documents that are
14       relevant to what they did?  Because they can't deny
15       it.  There's no contrary evidence to this.  The
16       evidence is not just compelling, it is the only
17       evidence at this trial.
18            Now, compare that conduct to Mrs. Warrick.
19       Like most smokers, she continued to believe, as she
20       testified, that cigarettes were not hazardous.  She
21       testified, when asked the question directly, that
22       she did not know that cigarettes were harmful until
23       the '80s when all of those events, the death of her
24       sister, Calvin's heart attack, the death of her
25       friend, to coalesce for them.  She, like most

 1       smokers at the time accepted their denials.
 2            Now, why do we know that most smokers did it?
 3       Because these companies researched their smokers and  4       tried to determine what they believed and didn't
 5       believe.  And we showed you those documents in
 6       Dr. Proctor's testimony and in Dr. Goldberg's
 7       testimony.  Their own internal surveys indicated
 8       that close to two-thirds of the smokers, their
 9       customers, accepted their denials and rejected
10       that cigarettes caused cancer and were harmful.
11            Dr. Goldberg said, "Even those that said it was
12       harmful compared it to getting out of a bathtub in
13       terms of the risk."
14            They knew they had provided a psychological
15       crutch that worked.
16            Not only did Dr. Goldberg testify to that, but
17       one of the documents you will have is from the
18       Federal Trade Commission.  Look at it closely.  It
19       describes its survey research around the country of
20       smokers in trying to determine the effectiveness.
21            Let's move to the Federal Trade Commission.
22            VIDEO TECH OPERATOR:  Which one?
23            MR. SHIELDS:  The Federal Trade Commission
24       document.
25            While she's finding it, what their survey

 1       documents indicated is that -- here we go.  Here's
 2       the Federal Trade Commission Report.
 3            And what this Federal Trade Commission Report
 4       indicated is that the Commission believes that the
 5       warning label on cigarette packages has not
 6       succeeded in overcoming the prevalent attitude
 7       toward cigarette smoking created and maintained by
 8       the cigarette companies through their
 9       advertisements, particularly the barrage of
10       commercials on television which portray smoking as a
11       harmless and enjoyable social activity that is not
12       habit-forming and involves no hazards to health.
13            That's what the United States Government
14       concluded from its survey of smokers, and that's
15       what the compelling evidence shows here as well.
16            Let's talk about causation now.  You're going
17       to hear about causation, I expect, from the
18       defendants, as they try to say, "But anything we did
19       didn't cause her to smoke."
20            The evidence is to the contrary.  Dr. Goldberg
21       testified that she started smoking in the first
22       place, as she did, because of their marketing and
23       advertising, using celebrities and athletes,
24       creating the impression that everybody smoked,
25       creating the impression that it was glamorous.

 1       Mrs. Warrick testified she started smoking because
 2       of the glamour, because you went to the movies, you
 3       saw everybody smoking, and everybody around her
 4       smoked.
 5            Then she became addicted.  And with addiction
 6       comes the difficulty of trying to quit and the
 7       willingness to accept the denials of the companies
 8       as a reason not to quit.
 9            And so Dr. Goldberg described for you their
10       massive advertising campaign in which they drowned
11       out any public health message.  You may recall his
12       term for that, as a marketing professor, was "share
13       of voice."
14            And he had this fulcrum that he showed you 15       as to what was going on.  You had the tobacco
16       industry's heavy, sophisticated advertising
17       promotion, and you had to compare that to what
18       public health warnings were available.
19            Now, you saw yesterday various articles and
20       public health information that was put on for you,
21       but where was the witness to say, "This public
22       health message ran on the following stations for the
23       following time periods and with this frequency"?
24       Where was the witness that told you, "This was on
25       all the time so somebody would have known it"?  They

 1       didn't put on anybody.
 2            Dr. Goldberg testified that what the Federal
 3       Trade Commission and what he had determined as well
 4       was, first, that these warnings, under the Fairness
 5       Doctrine, were only for a limited period of time in
 6       the late '60s; secondly, in order to comply the
 7       stations, in fact, played them but at 2:00 in the
 8       morning, so that they technically complied, but how
 9       many people were up to see those kind of warnings
10       and with what frequency?  And then after the ban on
11       advertising on television, those health messages
12       virtually disappeared.
13            That's the undisputed testimony.  No testimony
14       from the defendants at all about what any of that
15       material meant or how often it was played.
16            They also showed you some documents, some
17       newspapers in Life magazine and so forth, as if that
18       would indicate to Mrs. Warrick that she knew
19       something or should have known something.  What they
20       didn't tell you was that in each of those articles
21       the tobacco industry denies what the article claims.
22       What they didn't tell you is that that Life magazine
23       was full of ads.
24            As Dr. Goldberg said, the ads just dominated.
25       And surveys have shown that for those magazines that

 1       took tobacco advertising, they seldom put out any
 2       anti-tobacco or public health message.
 3            The fact is, marketing works.  The fact is,
 4       their advertisement works.  I know we all say, "Oh,
 5       I'm not impacted by advertising.  I'm not impacted
 6       by marketing.  I didn't go out and buy Tide because
 7       there's all that advertising on television."  But
 8       that survey evidence indicates to the contrary.
 9            Ask yourself this question.  Do you think the
10       tobacco companies, as sophisticated in marketing and
11       advertising as they were, would spend the vast
12       amount of money that they did on their heavy,
13       sophisticated advertising program if it didn't work?
14            They knew it worked.  They tested it.  They
15       surveyed eight people.  It worked.  It convinced
16       their customers to continue smoking their product.
17       And a few Public Service Announcements and articles
18       in the paper didn't change that.
19            So the simple and compelling logic here is as
20       follows:  She started smoking as a child because
21       they focused their advertising on children to get
22       them to smoke.  She became addicted.  And then once
23       she became addicted, she needed a psychological
24       crutch to continue to smoke, and they knew it.  And
25       so with their heavy, sophisticated campaign of 4552
 1       denial and deceit, they continued to persuade her to
 2       continue smoking over the years.
 3            Now, they may say, "Well, she couldn't recall a
 4       specific thing we said or a specific document."
 5       That misses the point.  Nobody 50 years later can
 6       say, "Oh, I remember the Frank Statement," or 50
 7       years later, "I remember this specific ad," although
 8       she did testify in some detail about what she
 9       remembered about a lot of ads.
10            The fact is, it's all of that together that
11       creates this image of what you believe.  That's what
12       they created.  They created a whole culture around
13       her of smoking that took her decades to break
14       through and recognize the harm and then attempt to
15       quit.
16            There is a related causation issue that I want
17       to talk about next.  And that is, did cigarette
18       smoking cause her death by causing her death through
19       lung cancer and COPD?
20            All of their evidence in this case literally
21       dealt with that issue.  They put on Dr. Bishopric.
22       They put on Dr. Shuman.  They talked at length about
23       whether or not, in fact, she died of cigarette
24       smoking as opposed to heart disease.
25            That's a false issue.  It's a false issue

 1       because whether she died as a result of COPD or lung
 2       cancer, she's still entitled to recover.  The estate
 3       is still entitled to recover.  That doesn't provide
 4       a defense to this claim.  It just determines what
 5       kind of recovery she gets, whether it's what's
 6       called a "wrongful death claim" or whether it's a
 7       survival claim.
 8            Now, the undisputed facts are she was diagnosed
 9       with COPD in 1991, that Dr. Bagnoli started treating
10       her for COPD and treated her for the rest of his
11       life -- her life, that she grew progressively worse,
12       being disabled in 1994 from working, going on oxygen
13       full-time, requiring a walker, ultimately requiring
14       a wheelchair, that she was diagnosed with lung
15       cancer, the worst kind you could have, stage IV,
16       that she went through debilitating, toxic
17       chemotherapy, that she went through radiation, that
18       she spent 17 days in the hospital just before her
19       death, severely anemic, immunocompromised, with
20       pneumonia, frail, older than her stated age and
21       wasting, and that she died within four days of when
22       she got out of the hospital.
23            And her treating physicians, Dr. Bagnoli,
24       Dr. Nurani said it's because she had lung cancer and
25       COPD.

 1            But instead of calling her treating physicians
 2       or her local heart doctors or anyone else, they
 3       brought in two doctors from Miami to say, "Oh, no,
 4       it's heart disease."
 5            Now, those doctors had to admit that COPD, in
 6       fact, can cause the very condition that they were
 7       talking about.  They had to admit that chemotherapy
 8       can cause the very condition that they're talking
 9       about.  They had to admit that smoking-induced
10       coronary artery disease can cause the very condition 11       they're talking about.  They had to admit that, in
12       fact, as Dr. Shuman said, they may well have been
13       contributing causes to her death.
14            And that's the standard, whether they were
15       substantial contributing causes.  They didn't have
16       to be the only cause.  Her heart disease could have
17       been related to other things as well, as long as
18       there was substantial contributing causes.
19            But I'm not here to tell you, believe the local
20       doctors and reject their experts, because it doesn't
21       make any difference.  The fact is, we're entitled to
22       recover either way.  I'm not going to spend a lot of
23       time talking about their experts.  You're going to
24       have to decide, do I believe Dr. Bagnoli?  Do I
25       believe Dr. Nurani?  Do I believe the local

 1       physician that did the autopsy that said it had
 2       nothing to do with her heart condition, or do I
 3       believe a thousand-dollar-an-hour doctor from Miami
 4       that they brought in?
 5            But if you believe, in fact, she died from
 6       unrelated heart disease, all right.  It doesn't mean
 7       we don't have a claim; it just means we have a
 8       different claim.
 9            And as we're now going to turn to damage and
10       talk about it and we'll see, the irony is that the
11       survival claim, as opposed to the wrongful death
12       claim, probably has more economic value.
13            So let's talk about damages.  The first kind of
14       damages we're going to talk about are what are
15       called compensatory damages, that is the damages for
16       her actual injuries, whether you call it wrongful
17       death or whether it's a survival claim.
18            And so you need to understand the difference
19       between a wrongful death and survival claim.  And
20       one of the questions you're going to have to answer
21       very early is was her death on February 7th caused
22       by either or one of a combination of her
23       smoking-related illnesses?  That is, "Did COPD or
24       lung cancer cause or substantially contribute to
25       causing her death?"

 1            If you answer yes to that question, it's what's
 2       called a "wrongful death claim."  And a wrongful
 3       death claim has certain damages that the law of
 4       Florida provides.
 5            It provides that you can recover for medical
 6       bills, funeral expenses, Calvin Warrick, her
 7       husband's, loss of support and services, Calvin
 8       Warrick's loss of companionship, mental pain and
 9       suffering.  Those are the damages provided by
10       Florida law for wrongful death.
11            But if you determine that, in fact, she didn't
12       die from her COPD or lung cancer, it doesn't mean
13       she didn't suffer.  She had 19 years of suffering
14       from COPD.  She had extreme suffering during the
15       last year of her life from lung cancer.  All it
16       means is the "no" answer to the question is that
17       it's what's called a "survival action."
18            What does that mean?  All that means is the
19       claim that she would have had, had she still been
20       alive today, survives her death so that her estate
21       can assert it. 22            And the claim that survives her death that she
23       would have had, if she were still alive today, is
24       that she could recover for her medical bills, she
25       could recover for her pain and suffering, she could

 1       recover for her mental anguish, she could recover
 2       for her loss of enjoyment of life, for her
 3       inconvenience, physical impairment, and aggravation
 4       of her preexisting condition.
 5            Those are all parts of the damage that can be
 6       recovered in a survival claim.
 7            Basically, the difference is, wrongful death
 8       damages, you both recover medical expenses and -- on
 9       both, but for death, of course, you have funeral
10       expenses.  And the emphasis on the wrongful death
11       claim is on the damage to Mr. Warrick, whereas a
12       survival claim is the damage to her that she had for
13       the 19 years prior to her death.
14            And that's why I told you that in many respects
15       that survival claim may well have more value, be
16       worth more in damages for the wrongful death claim.
17       That's why I'm not going to spend a lot of time
18       disputing with them about whether it's a wrongful
19       death or a survival claim.
20            Now, what do we know about the damages?  First,
21       the medical bills.  It is agreed that the medical
22       bills are $683,682.27.  There is no evidence to the
23       contrary.  In fact, there's an agreement that that's
24       the amount.  And we're going to ask you, whether
25       it's wrongful death or whether it's survival, to

 1       award that amount of money as a starting point.
 2            Secondly, it is undisputed that the funeral
 3       expenses were $2,692.49.  No dispute.  We're going
 4       to ask you, if there's a wrongful death claim, to
 5       award that amount of money.
 6            Next, on the wrongful death claim, as I told
 7       you, the emphasis on it is Calvin, whereas the
 8       survival claim emphasis is on Mrs. Warrick.
 9            The unrefuted testimony is that one of the
10       elements of the loss of the value of services and
11       support is $234,000.  You remember Mr. Spruance that
12       testified towards the end of our case, the life care
13       planner, rehabilitation guy who determined what the
14       value was?  The only evidence you have is his
15       testimony as to the value of those loss of services,
16       and that's $234,000.  So that we're going to ask you
17       if you find wrongful death claim to award that as
18       well.
19            Let's go to the next one.
20            In addition, if you're going to award the
21       wrongful death claim, you have to determine the
22       entitlement for full reimbursement for Calvin
23       Warrick's loss of companionship, mental pain and
24       suffering from July 1991 until today.
25            Why July 1991?  Well, it could probably be

 1       argued to be earlier than that, but that's the time
 2       period when the COPD was first diagnosed.  And so he
 3       suffered some loss of companionship during that
 4       entire time period because of her disabilities,
 5       because of her problems.  And so we're going to ask
 6       you to award damages, under the wrongful death  7       claim, for that 19-year period of time.
 8            Now, let me say this -- and this is going to
 9       apply to the survival claim as well -- the law
10       doesn't provide a precise formula about how you
11       award damages for such items like loss of
12       companionship and pain and suffering.  Those are
13       left to your enlightened conscience as jurors.
14       That's what you are here to determine, among other
15       things.
16            Now, there are various ways to do it.  And I
17       can suggest ways to do it.  I doubt the defendants
18       will suggest ways to do it, but they could.  But
19       it's going to ultimately be up to you.
20            One way to do it, which makes a lot of sense,
21       is to think about the time period.  Think about the
22       fact that it's 19 years.  During those 19 years
23       every hour, every day, every month, every year these
24       damages occur, whether they're wrongful death
25       damages for Calvin or her pain and suffering in the

 1       survival claim.
 2            Now, we're used to thinking about being paid by
 3       the hour.  We're used to thinking about compensation
 4       based upon time.  One logical way that you can go
 5       about determining these kind of damages is to think
 6       about the total number of hours, total number of
 7       days, the months and years during that 19-year
 8       period, and to think in your mind, how many hours a
 9       day, and apply an hourly figure, as you would if you
10       were being paid by the hour at your job, and apply
11       it over that 19-year period of time.
12            And that works both not only on Calvin's loss
13       of companionship, mental pain and suffering, but it
14       works, if you're talking about the survival claim,
15       on her pain and suffering, impairment and the losses
16       that she would have had during that time period.  So
17       that when you answer no, if you answer no, and
18       you're over here for her pain and suffering, her
19       mental anguish, her loss of enjoyment, her
20       inconvenience, her physical impairment and her
21       aggravation, think in terms of each of those occur
22       every hour, every day, every month, every year over
23       that 19-year period.
24            Now, clearly, the pain and suffering is worse
25       during the last year when she's on chemotherapy and

 1       radiation and she's hospitalized and anemic and has
 2       pneumonia and respiratory distress, so severely
 3       immunocompromised.  So it may make sense in terms of
 4       figuring out time periods and how much to apply for
 5       an hourly basis to think about much larger amounts
 6       during that time period.
 7            But even if you go back -- and she's totally
 8       disabled by 1994.  She's on oxygen by 1997.  She's
 9       on a walker, in a wheelchair, unable to do things,
10       in constant pain and suffering.  So it's not just
11       the last year of her life.  You're going to have to
12       figure that out.
13            And we suggest to you the most logical way of
14       dealing with these damages is to approach it from
15       that standpoint, to make that very simple
16       calculation and figure out how much you, in your
17       collective wisdom, think it will be appropriate to 18       reimburse the estate for those losses, whether it's
19       wrongful death in Calvin's claim or the claim that
20       would survive her death as if she were still here.
21            Now, there is a second damage issue you're
22       going to have to address.  We have talked a lot both
23       about the original Engle findings and if you find
24       she was a member of the Class that she gets the
25       benefit of those.  Among those findings are civil

 1       conspiracy and fraud by concealment.  But we offered
 2       you massive evidence of that as well of all of their
 3       fraudulent concealments and their misrepresentations
 4       and their misstatements of everything.  That is what
 5       is justification for punitive damages.
 6            The Court's going to instruct you on the
 7       Florida law of punitive damages and the standard
 8       that you, as a jury, have to apply in order to award
 9       punitive damages.
10            Punitive damages are damages in addition to the
11       compensatory damages that are designed to deter and
12       punish the wrongdoer for their conduct.
13            Ladies and gentlemen, if there was ever a case
14       that justifies the award of punitive damages, it is
15       this case.  If there's ever any wrongful conduct
16       that justifies deterrence and punishment, it is what
17       they did over that 45- to 50-year period of time,
18       that massive civil conspiracy designed to keep their
19       smokers addicted, knowing, ultimately, that they
20       would kill 440,000 people a year, or more, and
21       knowing that as long as they provided their denials
22       and the psychological crutch, they could keep those
23       people smoking and keep making all of the profits
24       that they were making.
25            You're going to have to ask yourself one

 1       question and answer it on this verdict form.  Is the
 2       estate of Eveline Warrick entitled to punitive
 3       damages?  It's a simple question you're going to
 4       have to answer.  The evidence is overwhelming, under
 5       the standard of Florida law, that there is
 6       entitlement to punitive damages.
 7            If ever there was a case, this is the case in
 8       which there's entitlement for punitive damages in
 9       which you ought to be thinking about deterrence and
10       punishment.
11            One final subject, and then I'm going to sit
12       down.
13            They have asserted a defense.  It's called a
14       "statute of limitations."  And that's going to be
15       one of the questions early in the case that you're
16       going to have to face.  You're going to have to
17       answer this question on the verdict form.  And it's
18       this question:  "Did Eveline Warrick know, or by the
19       use of reasonable care, should she have known before
20       May 5, 1990, that she had chronic obstructive
21       pulmonary disease and that there was a reasonable
22       possibility that it was caused by the defendants'
23       actions?"
24            What's all that about?  That's what's called a
25       "statute of limitations."  A statute of limitations

 1       is a time period in which a lawsuit must be filed.
 2       And if it's not filed within that time period, the  3       claim is barred.  You can't bring it.
 4            Now, that date, May 5, 1990, is based upon the
 5       Engle Class action.  It is four years before the
 6       Engle Class action was filed, because there's a
 7       four-year statute of limitations for these kinds of
 8       claims.
 9            So not only do you need to determine whether
10       she was a member of the Engle Class, but also
11       whether -- as a member of the Engle Class, whether
12       there's a statute of limitations defense, which is
13       this question.
14            Now, since it's a defense, they have the burden
15       of proof, not us.  They have to prove to you by the
16       greater weight of the evidence that she knew or
17       should have known before May 5, 1990, that she had
18       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
19            If they don't meet that burden of proof, that
20       is, if it's equally divided, if you can't decide for
21       sure, that defense is gone, since they've got the
22       burden of proof, and you would answer this question
23       no.
24            Now, what's the evidence on this question?  The
25       evidence is from Dr. Bagnoli.  He said, "I diagnosed

 1       her a year later -- so that there wouldn't be any
 2       statute of limitations defense -- "in 1991 that she
 3       had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."  And he
 4       testified she didn't know until then that she had
 5       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  That's not
 6       unusual.
 7            Dr. Burns told you in his videotape that
 8       because of the function of the lung -- remember that
 9       chart he had of lung function and how it dropped
10       over the years -- that it took a pretty extreme drop
11       in lung function before you had symptoms and knew
12       you would have some problem.
13            In fact, the evidence here is, the way Eveline
14       Warrick ended up in Dr. Bagnoli's office was not
15       that she thought she had some lung problem; she was
16       hospitalized for what she thought was a reaction to
17       a red bug bite.  And it was as a result of that
18       hospitalization that she got sent to Dr. Bagnoli.
19       He did the tests and said, "You've got chronic
20       obstructive pulmonary disease."  And he told you
21       that, in his judgment, she clearly did not know
22       before then.
23            So the question becomes should she have known?
24       Should she somehow have known before a doctor ever
25       diagnosed her, before a doctor ever told her, that

 1       she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?
 2            Now, the defense is going to argue she should
 3       have known because she had a cough earlier.  A cough
 4       is not chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  A
 5       cough doesn't indicate, "Gee, I've got this lung
 6       condition that's a serious, chronic disease."
 7            The testimony is until there is this test, even
 8       a doctor doesn't know for sure whether or not you
 9       have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There
10       simply is no support for the claim that she should
11       have known before that diagnosis.
12            Remember that testimony I showed you at the
13       beginning, where she said in response to specific 14       questions, "I didn't have any breathing problems; I
15       didn't have any asthma; I didn't have any problems
16       that led me to think there was any difficulty until
17       1991" when Dr. Bagnoli diagnosed her condition.
18            So the answer to this question, one of the
19       first three questions you have to ask [sic], has to
20       be no.
21            You got three questions that you got to answer
22       initially:  One, was she addicted to cigarettes
23       containing nicotine?  The answer is yes, from the
24       compelling evidence.  That's the first part of
25       proving she's a member of the Engle Class.

 1            The second question you have to answer is
 2       whether that addiction was a cause of her chronic
 3       obstructive pulmonary disease.  The answer to that
 4       is yes.
 5            And the third important question is whether or
 6       not this statute of limitations applies, and the
 7       answer is no.
 8            Those are the first three questions you have to
 9       answer, and then you'll move beyond that to whether
10       she had a wrongful death claim or whether it was a
11       survival claim.
12            And, believe it or not, I'm going to sit down
13       at this point in time and let the defendants have
14       their say.  I'll be back to talk to you in more
15       detail after they've given you their argument and
16       tell you what responses I have to their argument.
17            I thank you again, not only for your attention
18       in the close to last two hours, but your attention
19       throughout this trial.  It is a pleasure to be in
20       front of a jury that is engaged and interested and
21       attentive to everything that's going on.
22            Thank you so much.
