22             MS. GALLAGHER:  Thank you, Your Honor.
23             Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  This
24         case is about Mr. Tullo.  This case is about
25         what he knew about cigarettes, how he knew that, 5057
 1         and why he made the decisions he did.  And the
 2         short answers to those questions that I'll spend
 3         the next hour or so talking to you about are
 4         that Mr. Tullo knew that smoking was dangerous
 5         and addictive.  He got that information from the
 6         public health authorities and his own family.
 7         Mr. Tullo made the decision when he would quit,
 8         and nothing the tobacco companies said or did
 9         impacted any of those decisions he made.
10             You've been presented with kind of two
11         different worlds in this courtroom.  One I would 12         call the litigation world that has been created
13         by the Plaintiff attorneys and their experts.
14         And then you have the real world in which
15         Mr. Tullo lived.
16             And in the litigation world you've had the
17         Plaintiffs bring you experts to come in and talk
18         about documents, talk about statements, talk
19         about ads that are decades and decades old.
20         Some of them older than some of you.  What they
21         haven't done is tell you that Mr. Tullo, the
22         person that this case is about, saw any of those
23         ads, heard any of those statements.  As Mr. Fasi
24         told you in opening statement, there's a missing
25         link.  And the Plaintiffs haven't brought that 5058
 1         to you.  They haven't shown that Mr. Tullo heard
 2         or saw any of that, much less that that had any
 3         impact on him.
 4             Now, we brought you some historical evidence
 5         also.  And you might be asking yourself, why did
 6         they do that?  Because we can't tell you that
 7         the Reader's Digest we put up, the information
 8         we put up, we can't tell you that Mr. Tullo saw
 9         that any more than they can tell you that
10         Mr. Tullo saw that information or heard that
11         information.  But we brought you that
12         information because if you listened only to the
13         Plaintiff's experts and to the Plaintiff's
14         attorneys and, in fact, if you listen to 15         Mr. Hammer today in his closing you would think
16         the tobacco companies were the only voice out
17         there talking about cigarettes.  And you know
18         that's just not true.  The medical press was
19         talking about cigarettes and the dangers of
20         cigarettes.  The lay press was talking about it.
21         The Surgeon General was talking about it.  The
22         public health community was talking about it.
23         And, in fact, you know from the testimony in the
24         case the Tullos themselves were talking about
25         it.  This was not something that only the 5059
 1         tobacco companies were involved in.
 2             So let's go back and look at what some of
 3         those other voices were, some of the other
 4         information that was out there.
 5             Now, you know that for a long time people
 6         have known that smoking was not good for you and
 7         that smoking was addictive.  You've heard
 8         evidence in this courtroom that during the 1940s
 9         and particularly in the 1950s some
10         epidemiological studies started coming out
11         having a scientific link between cigarette
12         smoking and disease and specifically lung
13         cancer.  But this wasn't something new.  People
14         had known for a long time that smoking was
15         dangerous.  And you've seen some of these
16         before.
17             This is Reader's Digest.  You've heard a lot 18         more about Reader's Digest in this case than you
19         probably ever wanted to hear, one of the most
20         popular magazines of its time back then.  This
21         is back in 1935, and Reader's Digest is talking
22         about on giving up smoking.  And what do they
23         say about tobacco?  That it is a drug, this is
24         1935, and that it gives you cancer.  This is
25         1935 telling the American public, cigarette 5060
 1         smoking gives you cancer.
 2             The same is true with addiction.  As far
 3         back as Christopher Columbus, you heard, in the
 4         late 1400s people recognized that tobacco was
 5         hard to quit.  And, ladies and gentlemen, I say
 6         tobacco because it wasn't cigarettes.  The
 7         modern cigarette was hundreds and hundreds of
 8         years from being developed.  People knew back
 9         500, 600 years ago that smoking was difficult to
10         quit.
11             This is John Quincy Adams in 1845.  "In my
12         early youth I was addicted to the use of tobacco
13         in two of its mysteries, smoking and chewing."
14             1845 he's talking about tobacco being
15         addictive.
16             "Cigarette and the boys."  The Florida
17         Health Notes, you remember this from the early
18         1900s.  This one is 1906, and Florida Health
19         Notes, which was published here, says, "To-day
20         the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as 21         the very worst form of tobacco addiction."
22             This is not something new.
23             "Life without nicotine."  As I told you,
24         people for hundreds of years have recognized
25         that nicotine in cigarettes is difficult to give 5061
 1         up.  And here we are with Newsweek back in 1951
 2         telling people how to quit smoking, giving them
 3         some of the same things we'll see a little bit
 4         later in Smart Move that was published in the
 5         late 19 -- by the American Cancer Society.
 6         People recognized that smoking was difficult to
 7         give up.
 8             Now, it was no secret in the 1930s, '40s,
 9         '50s, '60s that smoking was dangerous and
10         nicotine was hard to give up, that it was an
11         addiction.  And let me talk a little bit about
12         the word "addiction."  Because you've heard that
13         it wasn't until 1988 that the Surgeon General of
14         the United States labeled nicotine addictive.
15         And it's because in 1988 the Surgeon General
16         changed the definition of addictive.
17             If you go back to 1964 when the Surgeon
18         General was talking about tobacco and the
19         dangers of smoking, the Surgeon General said,
20         nicotine is not addictive.  We are not going to
21         call cigarettes addictive.  And it's because of
22         the definition that they were using at the time
23         that required intoxication. 24             When we fast forward to 1988, the Surgeon
25         General says, yes, we're going to use a 5062
 1         different definition of addiction and therefore
 2         nicotine is addictive.  But does it really
 3         matter what label you use?  It doesn't matter
 4         whether you call it addictive.  It doesn't
 5         matter whether you call it dependence-producing
 6         or a really bad habit.  It all means the same
 7         thing.
 8             Now, the tobacco companies hung on to the
 9         old definition of the word addiction, and did
10         they hold onto that old definition of addiction
11         too long?  Yes.  Did the tobacco companies make
12         some statements that today we look at and say,
13         those are totally unreasonable?  Yes.  Did the
14         tobacco companies write things down that when
15         we're looking at them today we say, that's just
16         not reasonable?  Yes.
17             But the question for you in this case is,
18         did that impact anything Mr. Tullo did or didn't
19         do?  That is the question you have to answer in
20         this lawsuit.
21             Now, let's talk a little about the
22         statements that the tobacco companies were
23         making when they said cigarette smoking is not
24         addictive, when they said that cigarette smoking
25         doesn't cause disease and they said we need more

 1         research on this, we need to do more research.
 2         What did Dr. Riddel tell you about that
 3         yesterday?  She told you that what the tobacco
 4         companies were saying wasn't effective.  And
 5         remember she talked about awareness and she
 6         talked about people can hear things and be aware
 7         of things.  And then that has to transfer into
 8         do people believe things.  And she showed you a
 9         slide yesterday.
10             Jen, would you pull that please.
11             From 1954 up until 1990 when the tobacco
12         companies were making all these statements, what
13         happened to the belief in the American public
14         about whether cigarette smoking was a cause of
15         lung cancer?  If you start back here in 1954
16         with the blue graph and just follow it up to
17         1990, you can see that no matter what the
18         tobacco companies were saying out there it just
19         didn't work, because the American public
20         believed and believed through the years that
21         cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer.
22             The Plaintiff's attorneys want you to
23         believe that Mr. Tullo heard nothing except what
24         the tobacco companies were saying.  And that's
25         not true.  Let's get out of the litigation world 5064 1         and go back to Mr. Tullo's world.  Because in
 2         the real world we know that Mr. Tullo knew
 3         smoking was dangerous.  We know that because
 4         Ms. Tullo talked to her husband about the
 5         Surgeon General's Report.  She talked to him
 6         about the dangers that were in the Surgeon
 7         General's Report, and, in fact, Mr. Tullo said
 8         he had read about it, he had heard about it
 9         independent of what Ms. Tullo told him.
10             Ms. Tullo pointed out the warnings on the
11         packs of cigarettes.  And I'll show you those
12         later.  You've seen those.  The warnings that
13         said, cigarettes may be hazardous to your
14         health.  The warnings that said cigarette
15         smoking can give you lung cancer.  Ms. Tullo
16         pointed out warnings on those packages to her
17         husband.  And every time he reached into that
18         pocket to pull out a cigarette, he saw those
19         warnings.
20             The Surgeon General told Mr. Tullo in 1964
21         that smoking causes lung cancer.  You know that
22         he's read about it.  We've put up a lot of
23         things up here on the boards that you all have
24         seen, and one thing we do know that Mr. Tullo
25         saw were the newspapers.  He read the New York 5065
 1         Daily News and he was an avid newspaper reader.
 2         We brought you articles from the New York
 3         papers.  So there's at least a better chance 4         that he actually saw those rather than all these
 5         other things that Plaintiff's attorneys have
 6         brought to you that have absolutely no
 7         connection to Mr. Tullo.
 8             What did Mr. Tullo do when Mrs. Tullo would
 9         point out the dangers of smoking?  He would
10         ignore her.  He would get angry.  He would give
11         her the silent treatment.  He would get annoyed.
12         And sometimes he would blow smoke in her face.
13             Why?  Because he already knew what she was
14         telling him and he did not want her annoying him
15         any more with this information he already had.
16         And on some occasions Mr. Tullo would say, don't
17         worry, I'm smoking a filtered cigarette.  Well,
18         he was either telling Ms. Tullo that to get her
19         to quit nagging him, as she said in her plain
20         Brooklyn language that she would nag him about
21         the risks of smoking, so he was either doing
22         that to make her stop or he had heard what the
23         public health community was saying.  And it was
24         the public health community that was saying,
25         quit smoking, and if you don't quit, smoke a low 5066
 1         tar cigarette or a filtered cigarette.
 2             Now, ask yourself, if Mr. Tullo didn't know
 3         that smoking was dangerous, then why did he
 4         switch to a filtered cigarette?  If he thought
 5         that this was a less dangerous cigarette, then
 6         he had to know that the cigarettes he was 7         smoking were dangerous.
 8             And no one ever told Mr. Tullo that filtered
 9         cigarettes were safe or safer.  Everything you
10         have heard is that filtered cigarettes were less
11         dangerous.
12             When Mr. Tullo caught his daughter smoking,
13         Mrs. Casino, what did he tell her?  If I catch
14         you doing that again, you're going to be in
15         trouble.  She was 16, 17 years old stealing his
16         cigarettes, his filtered Marlboro cigarettes.
17         He didn't tell her, oh, you're okay because
18         you're smoking a filtered cigarette, what he
19         told her was, don't do it again.
20             This was in the mid '60s.
21             And even Dr. Cummings told you that he
22         thought Mr. Tullo was probably aware of the
23         health risks of smoking.  After we brought all
24         those things up, all the Reader's Digest, all
25         the magazine articles that's when Dr. Cummings 5067
 1         finally said, yeah, Mr. Tullo probably saw this
 2         and he was probably aware of it.
 3             In the lawsuit world Dr. Cummings and
 4         Dr. Burns would have you believe that Mr. Tullo
 5         was probably aware of the health risks of
 6         smoking, but that for some reason he couldn't
 7         quit.  For some reason he couldn't process the
 8         information that millions of other people
 9         processed. 10             You know, one of the things Mr. Hammer was
11         saying was, you know, in 1954, in 1964, if the
12         cigarette companies would have just said, we
13         agree with the Surgeon General or had put out
14         The Frank Statement and said, you know, we think
15         cigarettes cause lung cancer, what did he tell
16         you?  If they had done that back in 1954
17         Americans would have quit smoking.
18             People are still smoking today.  They have
19         not shown you that anything the tobacco
20         companies said or didn't say had any impact on
21         Mr. Tullo.  And everything that Mr. Hammer is
22         telling you in his closing argument is just pure
23         speculation.  He wants you to make the jump that
24         if the tobacco companies had done this then all
25         of America would have done something different. 5068
 1         And we know that that has just not happened.
 2             Let me keep on filtered cigarettes for a
 3         while.  Dr. Cummings and Burns want you to
 4         believe that Mr. Tullo started smoking filtered
 5         cigarettes, and particularly Parliament
 6         cigarettes, because of ads.  And Mr. Hammer
 7         actually got up and told you in his closing
 8         argument that those ads said that these
 9         cigarettes were safe or safer, filtered
10         cigarettes were safe or safer.  You've got a
11         bunch of ads that you can look at when you get
12         into your deliberations, and you are not going 13         to find that word on any of those ads.  That is
14         not what those ads were saying.
15             And the problem is, even if those ads said
16         that, the Plaintiff's attorneys and their
17         experts can't link any ad to Mr. Tullo.  No one
18         can tell you that Mr. Tullo based his decision
19         on what brand of cigarettes he smoked and
20         whether he smoked filtered cigarettes or
21         unfiltered cigarettes on any ad that's out
22         there.  It's Mr. Fasi's missing link again.
23         There is just no connection.
24             Let's look at the real world again.  The
25         Plaintiff's experts would have you believe that 5069
 1         it was the tobacco companies only that were
 2         talking about filters and filtered cigarettes.
 3         And, again, you know that's not true.  The
 4         tobacco companies were not the only voice
 5         talking about filtered cigarettes.  In fact, who
 6         were the people who were talking about low tar
 7         and filtered cigarettes?  The scientists, the
 8         Surgeon General, the National Cancer Institute,
 9         the American Cancer Society.  These were the
10         people who were telling smokers, quit smoking,
11         but if you don't quit, go to a cigarette that is
12         low tar, and one of the ways you can get low tar
13         is to smoke a filtered cigarette.  There were
14         other voices out there.
15             As far back as 1957 Dr. Wynder, Dr. Wynder 16         back here in 1957 questioned making cigarettes
17         safe.  And this is Dr. Wynder that you've heard
18         so much about with the mouse painting, and he's
19         on the -- in the medical press, he's in the lay
20         press.  You've heard a lot about Dr. Wynder.
21         And what Dr. Wynder is saying here is if you
22         remove the tar from cigarettes or you reduce the
23         tar in cigarettes that what he has found is you
24         reduce the risk.  In other words, he's saying
25         here, a 40 percent filter would bring most men's 5070
 1         tar intake down to the equivalent of well under
 2         a pack a day.  If you're smoking a whole bunch
 3         more and you reduce the tar, then you reduce the
 4         total exposure.  Nowhere here does Dr. Wynder
 5         say, and you're smoking a safe cigarette.  What
 6         he's saying is you reduce the tar.
 7             Here's Dr. Wynder again, two years later,
 8         April of 1959, "Smoking and Cancer," this is
 9         five years before the Surgeon General's Report
10         comes out, and here we have Time Magazine
11         talking about smoking and cancer.
12             And Dr. Wynder despairs of persuading 55
13         million Americans to quit the habit. "But how am
14         I going to get 55 million people to quit the
15         habit?  But to make it safer, he urges
16         manufacturers to use low tar tobaccos and the
17         most potent filters they can find."
18             This is what Dr. Wynder is saying in 1959. 19         Everyone agreed, including every single Surgeon
20         General, that if tar could be reduced,
21         cigarettes would be less dangerous, not safe, no
22         one has ever said that smoking a low tar
23         filtered cigarette is safe.  What the public
24         health community said was that it was less
25         dangerous.  But they told you and we'll look at 5071
 1         these, it could still cause lung cancer and
 2         death.
 3             As I told you, one way to reduce the tar is
 4         filters, to smoke a filtered cigarette.
 5             And here we go.  Most scientists -- and this
 6         is To Smoke Or Not To Smoke from ACS is the
 7         American Cancer Society and you have all of
 8         these back in the jury room with you when you
 9         deliberate and you can look at the entire
10         document.
11             But this is the American Cancer Society
12         saying to smoke or not to smoke.  And they say:
13         "Most scientists believe that a decrease in the
14         intake of tar, either by filtration or a
15         reduction in smoking reduces the risk of lung
16         cancer."  Either by filtration put a filter on
17         the cigarette to reduce the tar or a reduction
18         in smoking, smoke less cigarettes.  Reduces the
19         risk of lung cancer, but nowhere here does it
20         say it takes away the risk of lung cancer.
21             Here's the New York Times.  This is January 22         15th, 1964, Terry, you remember Terry was the
23         Surgeon General in 1964.  Qualifies filter tip
24         reply, "To the extent that a filter removes tar
25         and nicotine and gaseous elements of cigarette 5072
 1         smoke, it is not reasonable to assume that the
 2         affects of the filter will be similar to the
 3         effects reported by the committee on smoking
 4         fewer cigarettes."
 5             So they're saying here, although it will
 6         reduce it, it is not the same as not smoking.
 7         There is a difference.  It is a reduction in the
 8         harm.  It is not making it safe.
 9             Here we have 1967 news release by a senator.
10         This is after the Surgeon General's Report and
11         he says, "Hopefully, the wide dissemination of
12         this information and the growing awareness of
13         its significance among the smoking public will
14         channel competition in the cigarette industry
15         toward the marketing of cigarettes of
16         progressively low tar and nicotine content.  For
17         the best of our knowledge, such a change would
18         produce progressively less hazardous cigarettes
19         for the American public."
20             Here is a senator calling on the tobacco
21         companies to make filtered cigarettes because we
22         think it will make it less hazardous.
23             Here we have the Department of Health,
24         Education and Welfare from 1968.  You heard some 25         of this from Dr. Riddel yesterday.  And here we 5073
 1         are talking about the effects of filter
 2         cigarettes on the risk of lung cancer.  "This
 3         leads to the estimate that the person who
 4         switches to a filter cigarette has about 60
 5         percent of the risk of a person in the same
 6         exposure category who continues to smoke regular
 7         cigarettes."
 8             That would be nonfiltered cigarettes.
 9             Here we're talking about a reduction in risk
10         again.
11             1979 Surgeon General's Report.  We've jumped
12         a decade.  The Surgeon General is still saying
13         filter cigarettes, "Use of filter cigarettes and
14         smoking of cigarettes with lower amounts of tar
15         and nicotine decrease lung cancer mortality
16         rates among smokers."
17             And, again, the Surgeon General is saying
18         decrease.  It does not eliminate it.  What is
19         out in the public health, what the public health
20         is putting out is reduce your tar, one of the
21         ways you can reduce your tar is through using a
22         filter, but it's only going to reduce your risk,
23         it does not take it away.
24             And then one more from the 1981 Surgeon
25         General's Report.  And, again, they're saying 5074 1         the same thing.  You have higher lung cancer
 2         incidents in people who smoke the higher tar
 3         than you do who smoke lower tar.  And once again
 4         they're not saying lung cancer goes away.  What
 5         they're saying is you reduce the amount.  The
 6         message is clear over the decades that it is not
 7         going to be a safe cigarette, but that a
 8         filtered cigarette reduces the harm.
 9             So what did the tobacco companies do?  They
10         did what the public health community was
11         advocating.  They studied filters, they sold
12         filtered cigarettes.  Before Wynder and the
13         others in the public health community told
14         people to smoke filtered cigarettes back in 1953
15         the filter market was 3 percent of all of
16         cigarettes sold.  By 1968 that number -- 1967,
17         that number was up to 68 percent.
18             People had heard the public health community
19         message, reduce your tar, do it by smoking a
20         filtered cigarette, and Americans were doing
21         that, Mr. Tullo was one of them.
22             Now, how do we know that Mr. Tullo was
23         smoking filtered cigarettes because of the
24         public health community?  We know that because
25         he told us so.  And he told us so through 5075
 1         Mrs. Tullo.
 2             Remember when the Surgeon General's Report 3         came out Mrs. Tullo said she talked to her
 4         husband about it.  And he said, yes, I've read
 5         about it, that's why I'm smoking a filtered
 6         cigarette.  He never said, you know, I saw this
 7         ad for filtered cigarettes and that's why I'm
 8         smoking it.  He specifically told his wife, I
 9         saw the Surgeon General's Report, I've heard the
10         message, and I am smoking a filtered cigarette.
11             Now, let's take a step back here.  With all
12         the talk about Parliaments you might think that
13         those were the only filtered cigarettes that
14         Mr. Tullo smoked, and we know that's not right.
15         He also smoked Kent filtered cigarettes and he
16         smoked Marlboro filtered cigarettes.
17             Now, admittedly, when Mr. Tullo started
18         smoking any brand of cigarettes is unclear at
19         best.  But we do know when he was smoking a
20         specific filtered cigarette and that's Marlboro
21         and it's from somewhere in the mid '60s to about
22         1970.
23             And how do we know that?
24             Well, we know that from Ms. Casino, the
25         Tullo's daughter.  Remember, she was born in 5076
 1         1951 and she told you about the time that she
 2         was 16 she started snitching cigarettes from her
 3         dad.  And she remembers that the cigarettes she
 4         stole from her dad were Marlboros.  And she
 5         remembers that because that's the brand she 6         stuck with her entire life until she quit
 7         smoking the very first time she tried.
 8             She has personal experience that makes her
 9         able to give us a better time frame of when
10         Mr. Tullo was smoking a specific cigarette.
11             And what does Ms. Casino also tell us?  That
12         he was still smoking Marlboro cigarettes until
13         she left the house when she was 19 years old.
14         This was 1970.  And so we know it is some time
15         after 1970 that Mr. Tullo switched to Parliament
16         cigarettes.
17             And I want to read an instruction the judge
18         gave you.  And that is the instruction the judge
19         gave you on warning labels.  And what Judge
20         Sasser read to you was, "I instruct you that the
21         warning labels placed on cigarette packs and
22         advertisements by Defendants complied with
23         federal law and Defendants had no obligation to
24         place any additional warnings on their cigarette
25         packages and advertisements." 5077
 1             And then doctor -- Judge Sasser also
 2         instructed you, "I also instruct you that as
 3         long as the cigarette packs bear the federally
 4         mandated warnings," you've seen those,
 5         "cigarette advertising from July 1, 1969 forward
 6         cannot be the subject of any claim that the
 7         advertising undermined or neutralized the
 8         warnings or made them less effective." 9             So what does that tell you?  All those ads
10         that Dr. Cummings showed you after '69, you
11         can't take those ads under this instruction --
12             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach?
13             (A bench conference occurred as follows:)
14             MR. HAMMER:  That's not what the instruction
15         reads.  What it means is we can't -- as far as
16         the ads themselves, as far as whether or not
17         they may influence the jury, certainly that can
18         come into play.
19             THE COURT:  The argument -- the objection is
20         overruled.
21             (The bench conference ended.)
22             MS. GALLAGHER:  So what does this
23         instruction tell you?  This instruction tells
24         you, from Judge Sasser, that you are not allowed
25         to say when an ad has a warning that the ad 5078
 1         itself somehow cancelled out the warnings or
 2         made it less effective.  That's not allowed
 3         under this instruction.
 4             So let's get back to some time before 1970
 5         when Mr. Tullo was smoking Marlboros.  After
 6         some time in 1970 we know he started smoking
 7         Parliaments.  And we know that before Mr. Tullo
 8         smoked Parliaments, he smoked Marlboros and
 9         before that, he smoked Kents.
10             And we know from Mrs. Tullo that Mr. Tullo
11         switched to filtered cigarettes some time after 12         the Surgeon General's Report.
13             Now, ask yourself, if he was smoking
14         Parliament cigarettes because of the recessed
15         filter, why did he wait until 1970?
16         Dr. Cummings came in and showed you ads of the
17         recessed filter as far back as 1958.  If
18         Mr. Tullo was affected or impacted in any way by
19         those ads, why did he wait 12 plus years to
20         start smoking Parliament cigarettes?
21             Ask yourself, if Mr. Tullo was so influenced
22         by these ads, like Dr. Cummings said, why didn't
23         he start smoking filtered cigarettes back in the
24         1950s?  He started smoking them after the
25         Surgeon General's Report.  And it's funny, 5079
 1         because although Dr. Cummings brought you all
 2         these ads and talked about the wallpaper of ads
 3         out there, when we asked him, okay, you can't
 4         tell us why Mr. Tullo switched from one filtered
 5         brand to another, his answer was, no, I can't
 6         tell you that.
 7             They can't make the link between the
 8         documents and the ads they brought you and
 9         Mr. Tullo.
10             There's also another disconnect on the
11         testimony of recessed filters.  Mrs. Tullo told
12         you that Mr. Tullo said he was smoking
13         Parliament because of the recessed filter, but
14         that was only after Mr. Hammer had put those 15         words in her mouth.  He said, did Mr. Tullo tell
16         you he was smoking Parliament because of the
17         recessed filter?
18             And she said, oh, yeah, the recessed filter.
19             When I asked her questions, she admitted
20         that she heard the word "recessed" in this
21         courtroom, in the litigation world.  That's
22         where the term "recessed" came up.
23             Mr. Tullo never said a word about recessed
24         filters.  He never said a word about ads.  What
25         Mr. Tullo talked about was I heard the public 5080
 1         health community and that's why I started
 2         smoking filtered cigarettes.
 3             Mr. Tullo wasn't listening to the ads or
 4         reading the ads or basing his decisions on
 5         something that was in an advertisement.  He was
 6         smoking different filtered cigarettes until he
 7         found the one he liked and that's the one he
 8         stuck with.
 9             Now, you kind of had to listen carefully to
10         Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns to really understand
11         what their criticism of filters is.  Because
12         they would agree that if you reduce tar, that's
13         a good thing; and if you reduce tar by using a
14         filtered cigarette, that's a good thing.  What
15         their real criticism of filters is is that they
16         don't work for all smokers.  And that's because
17         some smokers compensate. 18             And by compensating that means they're
19         trying to get more nicotine and so they smoke
20         differently than they did before.  And so the
21         filters aren't getting rid of the extra tar.
22         And there were two major ways you heard about
23         compensation, one is you go from a full-flavored
24         cigarette to a low-tar cigarette and you
25         increase the amount you're smoking.  Well, if 5081
 1         you increase the amount you're smoking, you're
 2         going to get more tar.
 3             The second way that they told you about was
 4         to inhale more deeply.  If people took a
 5         full-flavored cigarette and smoked it one way,
 6         but then took a low-tar cigarette and smoked it
 7         much more deeply, inhaled more deeply, then
 8         they're going to get more tar.  That is their
 9         real criticism of filters.
10             Now, if you listen to them, Dr. Cummings and
11         Dr. Burns, what they're trying to convince you
12         is that the tobacco companies were the only ones
13         out there who understood this concept of
14         compensation and that the tobacco companies
15         understood compensation and hid it.  They hid it
16         from the public health community, didn't tell
17         anybody about it.
18             Well, we know that's just not true.  In
19         fact, we know the opposite is true.  The public
20         health community understood the concept of 21         compensation.
22             Can I have the next slide, please?
23             A Study of Tobacco Carcinogenesis.  This is
24         from Cancer from 1957.  And in 1957 they're
25         talking about some numbers here about reduction 5082
 1         of tar and it says, "A reduction to such level,
 2         as both animal experiments and human statistical
 3         studies show, will be followed by a significant
 4         reduction in cancer risk provided the number of
 5         cigarettes smoked is kept constant."
 6             What is that?  Compensation.
 7             1957 they're recognizing that if you lower
 8         the tar, it's only going to reduce the risk if
 9         you don't compensate.
10             1981, Surgeon General's Report -- I skipped
11         some decades for you all here, but they're back
12         there.
13             1981, Surgeon General's Report.  Again,
14         Surgeon General says, "Smokers who are unwilling
15         or as yet unable to quit are well advised to
16         switch to cigarettes yielding less tar and
17         nicotine, provided they do not increase their
18         smoking or change their smoking in other ways."
19             What is that?  Compensation.  Don't smoke
20         more cigarettes, don't inhale more deeply or
21         you're not getting the less-dangerous cigarette.
22             The lay press even reported on it.
23             Can I have the next one, please. 24             Terry Qualifies Filter Tip Reply.  You've
25         seen this one already today.  This is 1964.  "A 5083
 1         part of the problem here" -- this is the Surgeon
 2         General talking.  "A part of the problem here is
 3         whether the filter, in addition to removing tar
 4         and nicotine or other elements of cigarette
 5         smoke, might also lead to different levels of
 6         cigarette consumption and different amounts of
 7         inhalation."
 8             What's the Surgeon General talking about
 9         here?  Compensation.
10             Here we have Consumer Reports, not known for
11         its medical literature, but here's even Consumer
12         Reports reporting on this.  "Less Tar, Less
13         Nicotine:  Is that good?"
14             "Some smokers also increase the size of each
15         puff, thus increasing the nicotine per puff."
16         This is 1976.  "There are also other ways to
17         compensate" -- they actually use the word --
18         "for a drop in nicotine yield by drawing the
19         smoke deeper into the lungs, for example, or by
20         holding it there longer before exhaling."
21             There was no hiding by the tobacco companies
22         of this compensation.  And, in fact, the tobacco
23         companies actually specifically told the
24         government about compensation.  And you saw this
25         from the 1967, when FTC was thinking about
Tullo v R J Reynolds - Vol 34 - 04-12-2011 Trial Transcript 5084
 1         developing or instituting the Ogg Method.  And
 2         this was so that there would be a uniform way to
 3         measure the tar and nicotine in cigarettes and
 4         put it on the packs.
 5             So you saw these on the Elmo.  This is the
 6         Federal Trade Commission submission, remember, I
 7         flipped to the back and it was all the different
 8         tobacco companies.  And they submitted this to
 9         the FTC when the FTC was thinking about adopting
10         this.  And the tobacco companies are telling the
11         FTC, "The Ogg Method, in fact, does not and
12         cannot measure either all of the particulate
13         matter or the total nicotine from any cigarette.
14         It measures only the particulate matter and
15         nicotine in the volume of smoke puffed through a
16         machine on the standardized method.  It does not
17         measure the PM or nicotine in all of the smoke
18         that any cigarette might produce when totally
19         smoked under any and all conditions."
20             In other words, it's going to tell you what
21         the machine gets, it's not going to tell you
22         what each individual smoker gets.
23             Well, did the FTC understand this?
24             Can I have the next one, please, Jenn.
25             Let's look at the Federal Trade Commission 5085 1         news release.  It starts with, "The Cambridge
 2         Filter Method does not and cannot measure these
 3         many variations in human smoking habits."
 4             Doesn't that kind of sound like what tobacco
 5         companies submitted to them.
 6             "Thus" -- and here's what they tell you the
 7         purpose of putting these numbers on is -- "the
 8         purpose of testing is not to determine the
 9         amount of tar and nicotine inhaled by any human
10         smoker, but rather to determine the amount of
11         tar and nicotine generated when a cigarette is
12         smoked by machine in accordance with the
13         prescribed method."
14             They recognize exactly what the tobacco
15         companies told them.
16             Let's look at the next one, please, Jenn.
17             Here we have the Federal Trade Commission
18         submission.  Again, this is from the tobacco
19         companies to the trade commission.  And they're
20         going through here and they say, "No two human
21         smokers smoke in the same way.  No individual
22         smoker always smokes in the same fashion.  The
23         speed at which one smokes varies both among
24         smokers and usually also varies with the same
25         individual under different circumstances even 5086
 1         within the same day.  Some take long puffs or
 2         draws.  Some take short puffs.  The variation
 3         affects the PM quantity in the smoke generated." 4             What does the FTC press release say?
 5             Can I have the next one.
 6             It's kind of hard to tell the difference.
 7         It's almost word for word is what the FTC says
 8         in its press release.
 9             This was not the tobacco companies hiding
10         the fact of compensation from the government.
11         Here is the most direct evidence of them
12         actually telling the Federal Trade Commission.
13         The Federal Trade Commission acknowledging it
14         and putting it out in its press release.  And
15         this was not something new, this goes back to
16         the '50s.  Compensation was understood.
17             Now, let's get away from the litigation
18         world and go back to the real world where
19         Mr. Tullo was living.  Because compensation was
20         not part of Mr. Tullo's world.
21             First of all, we know over the years that
22         Mr. Tullo smoked Parliaments, the nicotine and
23         tar levels went down.  And I showed you -- I had
24         to write this down, I can never remember the
25         name of this document -- the Directory of 5087
 1         Cigarette Brands From 1864 to 1997.  And that
 2         was the piece of paper that listed the various
 3         cigarettes and it would have the year and it
 4         would have the tar and nicotine levels on it.
 5         And then I showed you this graph.  And this is a
 6         summary of what's in that document.  And in 1970 7         Parliaments had 18.9, almost 19 milligrams of
 8         tar.  By 1995 it was 11, a little more than
 9         half.
10             The nicotine had fallen from 1.25 to .09
11         [sic].  So what does that tell us?  It tells us
12         Mr. Tullo was getting less tar and nicotine, in
13         fact, he was getting percentage-wise less tar in
14         1995 and more nicotine if you look at the
15         numbers.
16             Now, the Plaintiffs want you to believe that
17         Mr. Tullo must have compensated.  But what do
18         they do when they do that?  They ignore what
19         people have said about Mr. Tullo's smoking.
20         Because those people who knew Mr. Tullo said he
21         always smoked the same.  It didn't matter if he
22         was smoking filtered cigarettes or unfiltered
23         cigarettes, he smoked the same amount.
24             When he switched from unfiltered to
25         filtered, he didn't start smoking more. 5088
 1         Everybody says he smoked the same amount.
 2             And what do we know about the way Mr. Tullo
 3         smoked?  Again, you ask the people who knew him.
 4         Because they all said, didn't matter what
 5         cigarette he was smoking, didn't matter if it
 6         was a filtered cigarette, an unfiltered
 7         cigarette, cigarette he was smoking in the '50s
 8         or the '80s, he inhaled them so deeply his
 9         cheeks sank in.  That's inhaling pretty hard, 10         ladies and gentlemen, and that's something that
11         the people who knew him saw.
12             In the real world Mr. Tullo was not
13         compensating.  Mr. Tullo smoked the same number
14         of cigarettes and he smoked them in the same
15         way.  So Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings' criticism
16         that filters are no good is based on
17         compensation.  And compensation is not part of
18         Mr. Tullo's world.  It's in the litigation world
19         of Dr. Cummings.
20             One other thing on this government issue.
21         If the government really thought that they were
22         being duped by this filter issue, then why
23         didn't they issue two sets of warnings?  If the
24         government really thought that --
25             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach? 5089
 1             THE COURT:  Certainly.
 2             (A bench conference occurred as follows:)
 3             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, that's totally
 4         inappropriate.  We can't challenge the warnings.
 5         The warnings weren't effective or weren't
 6         sufficient.  The defense can't get up here and
 7         say the government should have given two sets of
 8         warnings.  It's their motion.  It's their motion
 9         and they're violating the Court's ruling.
10             MS. GALLAGHER:  I don't understand that
11         objection.
12             MR. GDANSKI:  Can't use the warnings as both 13         a sword and a shield.  It's used as a shield
14         against us and as a sword to say the government
15         should have given different warnings.  We can't
16         question the warnings.  There shouldn't be a
17         suggestion of alternative warnings.  If the
18         Court is going to permit alternative warnings --
19             MS. GALLAGHER:  That's not what I was
20         suggesting, Your Honor.  If they just listen,
21         they would see --
22             THE COURT:  That's not what she said.
23             MR. GDANSKI:  Can we get a preview --
24             THE COURT:  You're not saying there should
25         have been a different warning. 5090
 1             MS. GALLAGHER:  Not at all.
 2             MR. GDANSKI:  Her last words were --
 3             THE COURT:  If she does, then come up, but
 4         that's not what she said.
 5             Objection overruled.
 6             (The bench conference ended.)
 7             MS. GALLAGHER:  As I was saying, ladies and
 8         gentlemen, if the government thought they were
 9         duped, if there was some idea that this whole
10         compensation thing was hidden, that there was a
11         difference, the government understood that there
12         were dangerous cigarettes, whether they were
13         filtered or unfiltered, because nobody ever said
14         that filtered cigarettes were safe.
15             Let's look at the warning. 16             1966 to 1969, "Caution:  Cigarette smoking
17         may be hazardous to your health."
18             This warning went on every package of
19         cigarettes whether they were filtered or
20         unfiltered.
21             From 1970 to 1984, "The Surgeon General has
22         determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous
23         to your health."
24             They did not just go on unfiltered
25         cigarettes, it went on every cigarette package 5091
 1         in the United States.
 2             The same with the next set of warnings where
 3         it says, "Quitting smoking now greatly reduces
 4         serious risks to your health."
 5             " Surgeon General's warning:  Smoking causes
 6         lung cancer."  This went on every pack of
 7         cigarettes in the United States.  The warnings
 8         were not just for unfiltered cigarettes.  The
 9         warnings were telling the American public, it
10         doesn't matter what kind of cigarettes you
11         smoke, they are dangerous.
12             This case is not about whether Mr. Tullo
13         knew cigarettes were dangerous and addictive; he
14         did.
15             This case is not about whether Mr. Tullo
16         smoked filtered cigarettes because of ads,
17         because we know he didn't.
18             And it's surely not about whether low-tar 19         cigarettes are safe, because we know they're
20         not.  He was never smoking a safe cigarette.
21             So now that I've spent all this time telling
22         you what this case is not about, what is this
23         case really about?  And this case is about
24         whether Mr. Tullo was addicted and whether his
25         addiction was the legal cause of his lung cancer 5092
 1         and death.  That's the question you have to
 2         answer.  That's the very first question on the
 3         verdict form.
 4             Now, you'll notice in the instructions that
 5         Judge Sasser gave you that there is no legal
 6         definition of addiction.  There are lots of
 7         definitions in there for other things, but there
 8         is no definition of addiction.  And you've heard
 9         various tests and criteria used by different
10         people in this courtroom to tell you what their
11         definition of addiction is, but you know they're
12         not always correct, because the definition that
13         Dr. Cummings likes to use, he told you under
14         that definition Mrs. Tullo is addicted.  And she
15         told you that's just not right.  She's never
16         been addicted to smoking.
17             Well, one of the things that Dr. Burns and
18         Cummings say that you look at to determine if
19         someone is addicted is how much they smoke, how
20         many cigarettes do they smoke.
21             Now, Dr. Burns told you it was between one 22         and two packs per day.  And Dr. Cummings told
23         you that it was over two packs per day.
24             Now, why does Dr. Cummings pick the highest
25         number, two packs per day plus is what he said, 5093
 1         which is not even Ms. Tullo's testimony that it
 2         was two packs a day, because Dr. Cummings, the
 3         tobacco advocate -- anti-tobacco advocate, the
 4         general in the war on tobacco, cherry picks the
 5         evidence that supports his opinions in the
 6         litigation world and ignores the rest.
 7             Well, what did Dr. Cummings ignore?  For
 8         one, we have the medical records.  All of the
 9         medical records we have we have shown you that
10         talk about how much Mr. Tullo smoked.  And it's
11         all a pack a day or less.
12             Here is, in 1995, you can't see it, but
13         you'll have the record back there, May of 1995
14         when Mr. Tullo first goes to see Dr. Levine and
15         he tells her he smokes one pack of cigarettes
16         every two days.  And now Dr. Cummings says,
17         well, I don't believe that, because smokers lie
18         to their doctors about how much they smoke.
19             Well, let's look at his other records.  Here
20         it is, and this is after he has been diagnosed,
21         he tells his doctors he used to smoke one pack
22         per day.
23             And the next one, please, Jenn.
24             Another record, smoking history of one pack 25         per day.  This is right after he quit, stopped 5094
 1         two days ago.
 2             And the next one.
 3             He quit smoking about a month ago.  That was
 4         from July of '96, this is August of '96.  He
 5         quit smoking about a month ago after smoking a
 6         pack a day.
 7             I think we have one more.  And here --
 8         sorry.  Never mind.  Thought we had one more.
 9             Now, Dr. Cummings says that smokers lie to
10         their doctors about how much they smoke.  Why
11         would Mr. Tullo lie to his doctors after he's
12         been diagnosed and after he quit?  That just
13         doesn't make sense.
14             Dr. Burns at least acknowledged that the
15         medical records were in there when he said one
16         pack a day to two packs a day.  But Dr. Burns,
17         who has made over a million and a half dollars
18         testifying in the litigation world, also ignores
19         evidence that doesn't fit with his position.
20             So let's start with who says it was two
21         packs a day?  The only person who has told you
22         that is Mrs. Tullo.  All of the other family
23         members say, we don't remember, we remember it
24         was a lot, but we have no idea how much it was
25         per day.  And Mrs. Tullo is not really sure 5095 1         either, just that it was a lot.  And it's
 2         understandable that she can't recall exactly,
 3         because it's been a long time.
 4             Mrs. Tullo can't even recall how much she
 5         smoked.  You heard in her deposition testimony
 6         that we read that she said she smoked two
 7         cigarettes her whole life.  Then when she was on
 8         the stand she said she smoked a cigarette every
 9         day for some period of time.  And yet her family
10         remembers -- her family members remember her
11         smoking three cigarettes a day, smoking
12         socially.  It's been a long time.
13             The one thing that doesn't make sense is why
14         Dr. Cummings and Burns would ignore the Philip
15         Morris surveys when trying to decide how much
16         Mr. Tullo actually smoked, because that's
17         Mr. Tullo himself.
18             If I can get Conner's assistance for this.
19             You've seen this form.  And Mrs. Tullo has
20         told you that although her name is down there,
21         Mary Tullo, that this was actually filled out by
22         her husband, Mr. Tullo.  And in that form it
23         asks, "What are you smoking?"
24             And it says, "Parliament."
25             I know this is difficult for you all to 5096
 1         read, but you will have it back there.
 2             One of the questions is, "How many packs of 3         cigarettes have you smoked in the last two
 4         weeks?"
 5             And what does Mr. Tullo write down?  "10."
 6         That's a little less than a pack a day.  Which
 7         is consistent with what he was telling his
 8         doctors.
 9             Dr. Cummings completely ignores that.  And
10         Dr. Burns doesn't use it either, because he says
11         it's at least a pack a day.  This is Mr. Tullo
12         telling Philip Morris how much he smoked in the
13         last two weeks.  Why would he lie to Philip
14         Morris about how much he's smoking?  This is to
15         get free cigarettes.
16             And then we have the second survey.
17             It's a little unclear who completed this
18         survey.  Mrs. Tullo has said this is her
19         signature, that she signed this.  She has said
20         it's not her signature, that she didn't sign
21         this.  And she has also said, well, maybe a
22         little bit of this is mine, but she doesn't know
23         which little bit.
24             Well, Conner, would you put up the...
25             This is the handwritten list, you saw this 5097
 1         earlier.  This is the handwritten list that
 2         Mrs. Tullo wrote when she was writing down to
 3         help her memory the cigarettes that Mr. Tullo
 4         smoked that she could recall.  And I want you,
 5         when you get back there, look at the two 6         Marlboros and then look at the two Parliaments
 7         and see if you don't think that Mrs. Tullo is
 8         actually the one who filled out this form.
 9             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach?
10             THE COURT:  Sure.
11             (A bench conference occurred as follows:)
12             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, defense made a big issue
13         and took up a lot of time during this trial
14         about a handwriting expert.  They had one.  We
15         deposed him.  That expert who looked at these
16         documents -- they have to make a good faith
17         argument -- that expert who looked at these
18         documents couldn't even tell with any kind of
19         certainty whose writing this was.  And now
20         they're making an argument that is totally
21         disingenuous to this jury and asking them to do
22         something that their own expert couldn't do.
23             MS. GALLAGHER:  Your Honor, I don't
24         understand what the objection is and she did
25         testify at one point that she filled this out. 5098
 1             THE COURT:  She testified during the
 2         deposition and the jury heard the testimony.
 3             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, Ms. Tullo explained her
 4         answer, but more importantly, now they're asking
 5         this jury to compare handwriting when they know
 6         their own expert, who was supposedly an expert
 7         in the field, couldn't even make an
 8         identification.  It's inappropriate. 9             MS. GALLAGHER:  He could make the
10         identification, it's just when I saw this I
11         realized we didn't need a handwriting expert.
12             THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.
13             (The bench conference ended.)
14             MS. GALLAGHER:  All right.  So let's look at
15         this document.  And the reason I bring this to
16         your attention is because it says "Parliament"
17         and it says "1 pack per day."
18             If Mrs. Tullo filled this out, then at the
19         time she wrote this she said her husband smoked
20         1 pack per day.  In the litigation world here
21         she's telling you two packs per day in this
22         lawsuit, a lawsuit that has been brought years
23         and years and years after these forms were
24         filled out.  A lawsuit that's been brought years
25         and years and years after those medical records 5099
 1         were filled out.  And a lawsuit brought against
 2         the same company from which she got free
 3         cigarettes for her husband.
 4             Thank you for your technical assistance.
 5             Now, another thing that Dr. Cummings tells
 6         you to look at to see whether someone is
 7         addicted is whether someone is in control of
 8         their smoking.  And there's not really a whole
 9         lot of evidence on this point.  You heard from
10         Louis Tullo, Mr. Tullo's son, that he could go
11         to movies, he would go out to eat, that he would 12         go to weddings and he would not smoke.
13             Mr. Tullo also told you that when he was at
14         his son's house -- or when his dad was at his
15         house he would ask him not to smoke around the
16         children, not to smoke in the house and
17         Mr. Tullo would comply.
18             Now, these are examples of Mr. Tullo being
19         in control of his smoking.
20             For example, what did he do when he was at
21         the UN working?  We have no idea.  There's no
22         evidence on that.
23             And ladies and gentlemen, remember, it is
24         the Plaintiff's burden of proof here.  If you
25         have a question that can't be answered such as 5100
 1         was Mr. Tullo in control of his smoking, you
 2         can't fill in what you think the evidence might
 3         be.  The Plaintiff's attorneys have the burden
 4         of proof in this case and it's to prove their
 5         entire case to you, not just part of it, but the
 6         entire case.
 7             So let me get back to addiction.  Because,
 8         you know, whatever definition of addiction you
 9         use, it really doesn't matter, because whether
10         you believe that Mr. Tullo was addicted, the
11         question you have to answer was:  Was that
12         addiction the legal cause of his lung cancer?
13         And the answer to that is no, because everything
14         I'm about to say applies whether Mr. Tullo was 15         addicted to cigarettes or was not addicted to
16         cigarettes.
17             In the litigation world, Dr. Burns and
18         Dr. Cummings say, without having met Mr. Tullo,
19         we can tell you that he couldn't quit because he
20         was suffering from cognitive dissonance, that he
21         used a psychological crutch that kept him from
22         being able to quit.  And that -- this is again
23         the missing link thing, because the cognitive
24         dissonance, the psychological crutch that was
25         all created by the ads or statements that they 5101
 1         can't say Mr. Tullo ever saw or heard.
 2             Plaintiffs have the burden of proof in this
 3         case and they have put on no evidence that
 4         Mr. Tullo saw or heard a single thing their
 5         experts spent four days on the stand telling you
 6         about.
 7             And there's probably one part of
 8         Dr. Cummings' and Burns' testimony that left you
 9         maybe a little perplexed.  And that is both of
10         them said by 1998, 45 million smokers had quit
11         permanently.  They also both told you any smoker
12         can quit, addicted or not, any smoker can quit.
13             What Dr. Cummings and Burns cannot explain
14         is how those 45 million people, who were
15         presumably exposed to all of the same things
16         that Mr. Tullo was exposed to, quit permanently.
17             Forty-five million smokers, the great 18         majority of them addicted, many of them heavily
19         addicted, all quit by 1998.  They gave you no
20         reason, no explanation for why Mr. Tullo
21         couldn't have been one of those 45 million
22         people before 1996.
23             Let's go back to the real world.  You heard
24         that Ms. Tullo said she thinks Mr. Tullo tried
25         to quit smoking a few times in New York.  She 5102
 1         also says that she thinks Mr. Tullo might have
 2         fibbed to her, that she could still smell
 3         cigarettes on him and she told you that she did
 4         not think that Mr. Tullo gave smoking [sic] a
 5         very good try.
 6             And we've gone through this.  Somebody has
 7         to want to quit in order to stop smoking.
 8         That's common sense.
 9             Well, what do we know about Mr. Tullo and
10         his attempts to quit smoking.
11             What he reported to Dr. Levine was that he
12         had considered quitting, but he was too anxious.
13         And by the way, he never told Dr. Levine, don't
14         worry, I'm smoking a filtered cigarette.  All he
15         said was that he had considered quitting.
16             Considered is thought about.  Remember with
17         Dr. Cummings, you can consider something, you
18         decide something and then you act on it.  You
19         don't go on a diet, you don't start an exercise
20         program, you don't eat healthier by thinking 21         about it; you have to decide you're going to do
22         it and you have to take action.
23             What we know from Dr. Cummings, he told you
24         the best evidence of motivation, if somebody is
25         going to quit smoking, is the number of quit 5103
 1         attempts made.  In other words, Dr. Cummings
 2         says the best thing to see if somebody is
 3         actually motivated is how many times they
 4         actually try to quit smoking.  And what do we
 5         know about Mr. Tullo?  That in 60 years he tried
 6         three times.
 7             Now, ask yourself this, if you were
 8         unemployed for 60 years and you tried to find a
 9         job three times, do you think you'd be trying
10         very hard?
11             Now, we had the Smart Move.
12             Would you just put that up real quick.
13             Think about when Mr. Tullo was in New York.
14         Do you want to stop smoking?  There's no
15         indication that he actually did.
16             "Are you willing to make some changes in
17         your daily routine?"
18             Remember, this was all about triggers, that
19         if you smoke, there are certain things and
20         certain people, certain situations that are
21         going to make you think of a cigarette, like if
22         you've always smoked when you have coffee in the
23         morning, you're going to have to do something 24         with the coffee because it's going to give you
25         the trigger to want to smoke again.  There is no 5104
 1         evidence in this record whatsoever that
 2         Mr. Tullo did anything to get rid of the
 3         triggers for smoking.
 4             "Are you willing to put up with some uneasy
 5         moments after stopping?"
 6             Well, we really don't know because we're not
 7         for sure that he went for a whole day without
 8         smoking when he was in New York.  We do know
 9         that when he quit smoking in Florida after his
10         diagnosis there is no report in the medical
11         records of any withdrawal symptoms.  And
12         Ms. Tullo certainly did not testify to you about
13         any withdrawal symptoms he had after he quit
14         permanently.
15             And there's another reason, there's another
16         reason that Dr. Burns' and Dr. Cummings'
17         opinions that Mr. Tullo was unable to quit makes
18         no sense.  And it's a big reason.  And that is
19         that he actually quit.  When Mr. Tullo was
20         motivated to quit after he got his diagnosis, he
21         quit.  He put the cigarettes down.
22             Now, the Plaintiff's attorneys have tried to
23         tell you, well, he didn't really quit, that he
24         just cut back after his diagnosis.  Well, let's
25         get out of the litigation world and look at the
Tullo v R J Reynolds - Vol 34 - 04-12-2011 Trial Transcript 5105
 1         facts.  Because the facts are that Mrs. Tullo
 2         saw him smoke one cigarette.  Amy Miller saw him
 3         smoke one cigarette.  Mrs. Tullo found a pack of
 4         cigarettes in the car.  In a period of a year
 5         and a half Mr. Tullo smoked two or three
 6         cigarettes.  That's the evidence in this case.
 7             And you know he wasn't smoking regularly and
 8         we know that from Mrs. Tullo.  Remember how
 9         Mrs. Tullo told you she hated the smell of
10         cigarettes, his breath smelled like cigarettes,
11         his clothes smelled like cigarettes, he smelled
12         like cigarettes.  Remember what she told you
13         when she saw him smoking outside of the Publix,
14         when she saw him smoking a cigarette after his
15         diagnosis?  She was angry and she was surprised.
16         If he had been smoking regularly, she wouldn't
17         have been surprised.  She would have smelled it
18         on him.  Remember, she hated that smell.  She
19         was surprised when she found the pack of
20         cigarettes in the car.  And she was surprised
21         because she knew he had quit.
22             Mr. Tullo quit smoking cigarettes.  He
23         smoked a couple in the year-and-a-half after his
24         diagnosis, but he had quit.  This is not a
25         situation where he had cut down and was still 5106 1         smoking regularly.  He had quit.
 2             So let's go back to that first question you
 3         have to answer:  Was Mr. Tullo's addiction to
 4         nicotine the legal cause of his death?
 5             Now, legal cause, you've heard the
 6         definition of, that it requires a substantial
 7         and direct impact.
 8             I was going to put it on the Elmo, but --
 9         oh.  Jenn has more faith in my capabilities.
10             Okay.  Is the legal cause of death, if it
11         directly and in natural and continuous sequence
12         produces or contributes substantially to
13         producing such death so that but for the
14         addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine, the
15         death would not have occurred.  You have to have
16         a direct and substantial impact.
17             And the answer to that question is no.
18         Because you heard Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns
19         both talk about declining risk.
20             Do you remember declining risk?  This is
21         with Dr. Burns.  And what he was explaining was
22         that there's excess risk of smoking for getting
23         various diseases including lung cancer, but if
24         you quit, your excess risk goes way down so that
25         by the time you get 20 to 30 years out, your 5107
 1         risk, excess risk is almost that of a
 2         never-smoker.
 3             Well, think about if Mr. Tullo had quit 4         smoking in 1964 when the Surgeon General told
 5         him to, when his wife told him to, that was 32
 6         years before he was diagnosed.
 7             Mr. Tullo's addiction, if you believe he was
 8         addicted, was not the substantial and direct
 9         cause of his lung cancer; his failure to quit
10         was.  He wasn't so addicted that he couldn't
11         quit, because we know he did quit.
12             If he had been motivated to quit back in the
13         '60s, there is nothing to suggest that he
14         wouldn't have been successful, like he was later
15         on when he did quit.
16             He had the ability to quit and he
17         demonstrated that ability.
18             Now, Mr. Hammer put up all those other
19         questions for you, and in the interest of time,
20         I'm not going to go through them all again.  I
21         just want to point out one major thing that he
22         left out.  He talked to you about the findings
23         and he said you have the findings and you should
24         say yes, they were negligent; yes, there's a
25         defect in the product.  He forgot one very 5108
 1         important thing, because the findings are not
 2         enough for you to say yes to those questions.
 3             MR. HAMMER:  Objection.  Can we approach,
 4         please?
 5             THE COURT:  Sure.
 6             (A bench conference occurred as follows:) 7             MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, what counsel just did
 8         is question the findings.  Mr. Hammer did not
 9         say that they should say that they were
10         negligent or they were defective because there's
11         a finding of negligence, a finding of defect.
12         So what counsel just did was inherently question
13         this Court's ruling that the findings are
14         binding that they were, in fact, negligent and
15         they are in fact.
16             MS. GALLAGHER:  I said that's not
17         sufficient.
18             MR. GDANSKI:  What she just said to the
19         jury -- and I can check the transcript.
20             MS. GALLAGHER:  I don't understand the
21         objection.
22             MR. GDANSKI:  The objection is that counsel
23         has violated the Court's ruling on questioning
24         the findings.  And the transcript, I believe,
25         will substantiate that, but it has nothing to do 5109
 1         with legal cause.  I know that's where she's
 2         going, but the predicate should be:  We were
 3         negligent, but you need to decide if that
 4         negligence was a legal cause.  What was just
 5         asked to the jury was:  You need to decide if we
 6         were negligent, and that's improper.
 7             MS. GALLAGHER:  Your Honor, if he would let
 8         me get to my next statement, it would be that it
 9         requires legal cause, it's not enough, which is 10         what your instructions tell them to answer those
11         questions yes.
12             MR. GDANSKI:  That doesn't matter because
13         the first statement is improper.  I can check
14         the transcript right now.  It's improper.  The
15         findings have just been challenged and, you
16         know, don't really know how to respond to that.
17             THE COURT:  That's not how I heard it.  She
18         was going towards legal cause.
19             MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine, I'll take a
20         minute and look at the transcript right now.
21         I'll reserve on all my motions that I'd like to
22         make relative to that.
23             (The bench conference ended.)
24             MS. GALLAGHER:  Like I was saying, ladies
25         and gentlemen, the findings that Judge Sasser 5110
 1         read to you and the findings that Mr. Hammer
 2         told you are not sufficient for you to answer
 3         those questions yet, because they require
 4         something else.  And what they require is
 5         something that Mr. Hammer didn't talk to you
 6         about and that is legal cause.  Every single one
 7         of those questions requires legal cause.
 8             And you were probably wondering why every
 9         time you got a new instruction or a new
10         definition, a new question, you got a separate
11         instruction and definition on legal cause,
12         because it's required in all of those questions. 13             And because all of those questions require
14         legal cause, the answer to all of those
15         questions is no, just like the answer to the
16         first question is no.  Because nothing that the
17         tobacco companies said or did or didn't say or
18         didn't do was a legal cause of Mr. Tullo's
19         death.  The fact that tobacco companies sold
20         cigarettes is not enough to answer any of those
21         questions yes.  And as I said, the existence of
22         the findings are not enough to answer those
23         questions yes, you have to find that there was a
24         legal cause of Mr. Tullo's death, a direct and
25         substantial impact. 5111
 1             And it's just not there.
 2             Now, I want to talk to you a minute about
 3         the concealment question.  And rather than put
 4         it on the Elmo, there are two concealment
 5         questions.  And they say, "Please state for each
 6         Defendant" -- and one is a little bit
 7         different -- "whether Dominick Tullo reasonably
 8         relied to his detriment on an act done in
 9         furtherance of the Defendants' agreement to
10         conceal or omit material information concerning
11         the health effects and/or addictive nature of
12         smoking cigarettes and, if so, whether such
13         reliance was a legal cause of his death."
14             And what I want to talk to you about here is
15         something that Plaintiff's experts told you and 16         the Plaintiff's attorneys agree with.  And that
17         is that this supposed agreement to conceal
18         started in 1954.  No one has told you that the
19         tobacco companies concealed anything before
20         1954.
21             And why is that important?  Because both
22         Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings told you that by 1954
23         Mr. Tullo had started smoking cigarettes,
24         Mr. Tullo had become a regular smoker and
25         Mr. Tullo was addicted to cigarettes. 5112
 1             The Plaintiff's experts and attorneys are
 2         not saying that anything the tobacco companies
 3         said, did or supposedly concealed caused
 4         Mr. Tullo to start smoking or to become an
 5         addicted smoker.
 6             Let me say that again.
 7             Nothing that the tobacco companies did
 8         caused Mr. Tullo to start smoking or to become
 9         an addicted smoker.  So we're back to the very
10         same question.  And that is, did anything the
11         tobacco companies said or do, not say or not do
12         have a direct and substantial impact on
13         Mr. Tullo and his decisions about quitting?  And
14         I've talked at length about that and the answer
15         is still no.
16             Now, there's another part of those questions
17         and that is:  Did Mr. Tullo rely on anything the
18         tobacco companies said? 19             Now, we get back to the Plaintiff's
20         attorneys haven't proved to you that Mr. Tullo
21         heard anything the tobacco companies said, much
22         less that he relied on anything the tobacco
23         companies said.  And that is their burden of
24         proof for you.  They have to prove that to you
25         and they have failed to. 5113
 1             What do we know about Mr. Tullo?  We know he
 2         was his own man.  He was a smart man, a man who
 3         made his own decisions and a man who kept up
 4         with current events, a man who would not be told
 5         what to do.  He didn't listen to his wife, to
 6         his family, to the Surgeon General or the public
 7         health community when they told him to quit
 8         smoking.
 9             Mrs. Tullo told you that Mr. Tullo did not
10         listen to anyone, not that he didn't listen to
11         anyone except the tobacco companies.  He made
12         his own decisions.  People have the right to
13         make the decision as to whether to smoke or not
14         to smoke, but Mr. Tullo made the decision to
15         continue to smoke.  And he is the one who is
16         responsible for that decision.
17             Now, Mr. Hammer talked to you about the
18         percentage question and I want to address that
19         pretty quickly for you.  And I would submit that
20         you put, if you get there, and I don't think you
21         get there, because I think you answer the first 22         question no and you're done.  But as I told you
23         in voir dire, I've got to talk about all the
24         issues here, so I've got to talk about these
25         questions. 5114
 1             On the percentage question you put 100
 2         percent, if you get there, next to Mr. Tullo's
 3         name.  And the reason is that the Plaintiff's
 4         attorneys have admitted, and I'll read this to
 5         you, this was an instruction from the Judge, "I
 6         instruct you that the Plaintiff has admitted
 7         that Dominick Tullo shares some measure of
 8         responsibility in combination with the acts and
 9         omissions of the Defendants.  Specifically,
10         Plaintiff has admitted that Mr. Tullo's acts or
11         omissions" --
12             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, sorry, can we approach
13         minute.
14             (A bench conference occurred as follows:)
15             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, this was the exact
16         conversation we had about the use of this
17         instruction and that how the Defendants were
18         going to try to use it, which is why we made
19         that argument.  And I have to object to preserve
20         the record.  And, again, renewing our request
21         for that additional instruction, especially in
22         light of this argument now.
23             MS. GALLAGHER:  I don't know what he's
24         talking about.  We've got the instructions.  I'm 25         reading them to the jury. 5115
 1             THE COURT:  She's reading the instructions.
 2         Objection is overruled.
 3             (The bench conference ended.)
 4             MS. GALLAGHER:  "Specifically, Plaintiff has
 5         admitted that Mr. Tullo's acts or omissions
 6         relating to the frequency and duration of his
 7         efforts to quit smoking were a partial legal
 8         cause of his death."
 9             So what are the Plaintiffs saying here?
10         What has -- what is this admission?  Well, one,
11         they're saying Mr. Tullo is partially
12         responsible because he didn't try enough times
13         to quit and he didn't last long enough when he
14         tried.  The legal cause part of that, because it
15         says the partial legal cause, is that those
16         actions were a legal cause of his death.  And,
17         in other words, what they're telling you is that
18         Mr. Tullo could have quit and if he had quit
19         earlier, he would not have gotten lung cancer
20         and death.  That's what it means when they say
21         it is a partial legal cause.  He could have quit
22         smoking in time to avoid getting lung cancer and
23         die.
24             Mr. Tullo could have quit smoking earlier
25         and that's his responsibility.  He could have 5116 1         quit smoking in time to avoid his lung cancer
 2         and death, that's legal cause.
 3             It boils down to one simple thing, the
 4         Plaintiff's attorneys are admitting that
 5         Mr. Tullo should and could have quit smoking
 6         decades ago when everyone told him to and that's
 7         his responsibility.
 8             Now, the Plaintiff's lawyers want you to put
 9         some of the responsibility on the tobacco
10         companies, but, again, they're not saying that
11         the tobacco companies are responsible for
12         Mr. Tullo starting to smoke or Mr. Tullo
13         becoming addicted.  What they're saying is
14         tobacco companies are responsible for
15         Mr. Tullo's failure to quit.  And the evidence
16         in this case is Mr. Tullo could quit, he did
17         quit and he decided when to quit.  The tobacco
18         companies had nothing to do with that.
19             And that's why you put 100 percent next to
20         his name.
21             Now, Mr. Hammer talked to you some about the
22         damages question.  All I want to say on that is
23         Mrs. Tullo has been blessed with a strong
24         support group of family and friends.  And she
25         has been able to return to the activities she 5117
 1         enjoyed, doing her friends' hair, going to the
 2         pool.  She has returned to activities she liked 3         and she has had strong support from her family
 4         since Mr. Tullo passed.  But one thing I want to
 5         point out here is that you cannot let sympathy
 6         play any part in your deliberations.  That is
 7         not something that you can use when you are
 8         deciding questions in this case.  I think
 9         everybody would agree that Mrs. Tullo is a nice
10         lady and we all like her, but you cannot decide
11         the case on that.  That's what makes sitting in
12         your chairs hard.  Because you have to put that
13         aside and decide this case on the evidence.
14             The last question talks about entitlement to
15         punitive damages.  I want to talk a little bit
16         about the findings again, because the findings
17         are there, but they do not mean that the answer
18         to that question is yes, because it requires
19         more.
20             There's a different burden of proof.  It has
21         to be clear and convincing evidence, which is
22         precise, exact, of such weight to produce a firm
23         belief or conviction.  And they have to show
24         you --
25             MR. GDANSKI:  We need to approach. 5118
 1             (A bench conference occurred as follows:)
 2             MS. GALLAGHER:  I'm reading from the
 3         instructions again.  What did I do wrong this
 4         time?
 5             MR. HAMMER:  He's looking at the 6         instructions.
 7             MS. GALLAGHER:  It's in there.
 8             MR. HAMMER:  All right.  I just want to make
 9         sure.
10             (The bench conference ended.)
11             MS. GALLAGHER:  That is the different burden
12         of proof for this question.  And it's not enough
13         that we have an individual against corporations
14         here, because Judge Sasser has instructed you
15         that you have to treat all the parties the same.
16         And it's not enough that you say, I don't like
17         some conduct of the tobacco companies in the
18         past, you have to find conduct within the
19         instructions that Judge Sasser gave you.  And,
20         again, you have to find that it was a legal
21         cause of Mr. Tullo's lung cancer and death and
22         that's just not here, ladies and gentlemen.  The
23         Plaintiffs have not proved that to you.
24             I want to ask you to put aside the
25         litigation world that was created in this 5119
 1         courtroom and look at the real world of
 2         Mr. Tullo.  Ignore the world that has no
 3         connection to Mr. Tullo, no link to Mr. Tullo.
 4         In the end when you look at the evidence, it is
 5         clear that Mr. Tullo knew smoking was dangerous,
 6         he knew it was addictive.  He could quit and he
 7         did quit.  Mr. Tullo made the decision when to
 8         stop smoking.  Nothing the tobacco companies 9         said or didn't say had anything to do with the
10         decisions Mr. Tullo made.  He made his own
11         decisions and he is the one who is responsible
12         for them.
13             Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much
14         for your attention.  Thank you for participating
15         in the jury trial process.  On behalf of
16         Mr. Fasi, on Philip Morris and myself, thank you
17         very much.


9             MR. BIDEAU:  Counsel, Mrs. Tullo.
10             Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
11             (Jury collectively:  Good morning.)
12             MR. BIDEAU:  It's nice to finally get to talk
13        to you right off; where I look down as you walk in
14        the hallway or get on the elevator downstairs.
15             You haven't seen much of me, I haven't been up 16        here very much to talk.  And I'm not going to be
17        very long.
18             Ms. Gallagher gave a very compelling and a
19        very comprehensive closing argument in this case
20        and discussed really a lot of the issues --
21             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach?
22             THE COURT:  Yes.
23             (Sidebar held as follows:)
24             MR. HAMMER:  It's inappropriate for a
25        codefendant to comment on one of their 5163
 1        codefendants.
 2             MR. BIDEAU:  I was trying to explain why I'm
 3        not going to talk to them as long on every subject.
 4             MR. HAMMER:  A compelling argument, that's
 5        inappropriate.  She covered all the points I was
 6        going to cover; but to make a comment on quality
 7        and on what you thought --
 8             THE COURT:  Let's move on.
 9             MR. BIDEAU:  Yeah, I will.
10             (Sidebar concluded and the following was held
11        in open court:)
12             MR. BIDEAU:  Let me join Mr. Hammer and
13        Ms. Gallagher in thanking you for your time, for
14        your service and for your patience.  I will try to 15        move this case along.  I know it's not fun sitting
16        back in the jury room or sitting out in the
17        hallway, but we have tried to move the case along,
18        and we appreciate your time and your patience.
19             Yesterday Ms. Gallagher discussed with you
20        Mr. Tullo's smoking history, discussed his
21        decision-making, she discussed what was in the
22        public arena concerning the dangers of smoking,
23        going back really to Christopher Columbus.
24             She also discussed the issues relating to the
25        plaintiffs claim about filter fraud and why there's 5164
 1        just no basis for that claim, and so I'm not going
 2        to talk about those subjects in any great detail.
 3             I'm going to do what I did in my opening,
 4        which is really focus on my client, Lorillard.
 5        Because you haven't heard much about us in this
 6        case.  You haven't seen many documents related to
 7        Lorillard and, frankly, you haven't heard many
 8        witnesses talk about Lorillard.
 9             Give me the first slide.
10             Yesterday Mr. Hammer acknowledged that
11        Mr. Tullo smoked Lorillard product for what he
12        called a little, a short period of time.  Well, the 13        facts in this case are that the only brand of
14        cigarettes that Lorillard manufactured that are the
15        issue in this case are Kent.  And the facts are
16        also that Mr. Tullo smoked Kent for, at most, a
17        three-year period in the mid '60s.  That was 30
18        years after he began smoking and he was in his 40s
19        at the time.
20             And as I explain to you in a few minutes, Kent
21        could not have caused his injury or his addiction
22        in this case.
23             Yesterday Mr. Hammer said to you that
24        Mr. Tullo smoked Kent in 1958.  Folks, there is no
25        evidence whatsoever with respect to Mr. Tullo 5165
 1        smoking Kent in 1958.  Two witnesses have come
 2        before you to talk about when Mr. Tullo smoked
 3        Kent.  Stephanie Casino, his daughter, and
 4        Mary Tullo.
 5             And what Stephanie Casino told us was she said
 6        that she recalled her father smoke Kent when she
 7        was adolescent, 11, 12, 13, that time period which
 8        would have put us in the '63, '64 time period.
 9             Mrs. Tullo testified she didn't really
10        remember when he started smoking Kent or how many
11        Kents he smoked, but she did testify very clearly 12        that he didn't smoke a filtered cigarette until
13        after the Surgeon General's report in 1964.  Kent
14        is and always has been a filtered cigarette.
15             Those are the only two witnesses you ever
16        heard from with respect to when Mr. Tullo started
17        smoking Kent.  There is no evidence that he smoked
18        Kent before the 1963, '64 time period.
19             And with respect to when he stopped smoking
20        Kent, you heard from Louis Tullo -- you remember
21        him, we read some of his deposition transcript --
22        Louis Tullo is Mr. Tullo's oldest son.  And what he
23        said was he remembered his father switching to
24        Marlboro when he was 17 or 18.  Well, he was born
25        in 1949, and so he was 17 or 18, in 1966 or 1967. 5166
 1             Stephanie Casino testified that she started
 2        smoking Marlboro in -- when she was 15 or 16, same
 3        years, 1966, '67, she's two years younger.
 4             There is no evidence that Mr. Tullo smoked
 5        Kent after that 1966, '67 time period.  So what we
 6        have is a period of about 1964 to '67, that's it.
 7        That's the entire smoking history in this case with
 8        respect to Kent.
 9             So the one thing I do agree with Mr. Hammer 10        about is Mr. Tullo only smoked Kent for a really
11        short period of time.  Now, why is this important?
12        Well, it's important for a number of reasons.
13             One of those reasons is plaintiffs expert,
14        Dr. Cummings -- you remember Dr. Cummings, he came
15        down here, he had the big slide show, the big
16        presentation.  Well, one of the things Dr. Cummings
17        said -- could you put up the slide, Dr. Cummings
18        slide, number four.
19             One of the things Dr. Cummings said, okay, is
20        that while every cigarette counts, the risk of
21        cigarette smoking is related to the dose.  Do you
22        remember he talked about what he called the dose
23        response, that is the higher the dose, the more
24        risk that's involved.
25             And what he said is that if you're under 5167
 1        ten-pack years your risk over your lifetime is
 2        about equivalent to a person who's never smoked.
 3        Well, clearly, three years of smoking is under
 4        ten-pack years.
 5             Let me explain, by the way, what a pack-year
 6        is, since I think Dr. Cummings talked about it, but
 7        a pack-year is simply the number of packs per day
 8        times the number of years.  So if you smoked one  9        pack per day for three years, it's three-pack
10        years.
11             So what Dr. Cummings said is that while every
12        cigarette counts, if you're under ten-pack years,
13        your risk over your lifetime is equivalent to
14        somebody who never smoked.  So that raises the
15        question, did the three years of Kent smoking, was
16        that the legal cause of Mr. Tullo's lung cancer?
17        Did it produce or contribute substantially?
18             Do you remember Ms. Gallagher went through
19        legal cause yesterday?  The definition of which is
20        did it produce or contribute substantially to
21        producing his lung cancer so it can reasonably be
22        said that but for those three years of smoking
23        Mr. Tullo would not have suffered his lung cancer?
24             Well, Dr. Cummings, plaintiffs expert, has
25        explained that issue to you flat out.  The risk 5168
 1        doesn't increase until you get to ten-pack years.
 2        So the answer to that question is obviously no.
 3        And that's probably why you haven't heard a whole
 4        lot about us in this case.
 5             Another thing you hadn't heard about is why
 6        did Mr. Tullo actually smoke Kent?  Not a single  7        witness has told you why he smoked Kent.  In fact,
 8        every witness who's testified has said they didn't
 9        know, never told him, they didn't know, they didn't
10        see anything.  There were no documents that
11        referenced why he smoked Kent.  You saw a lot of
12        cigarette documents in this case.
13             Dr. Cummings, Dr. Burns had big powerpoints,
14        lots of cigarette documents.  And you're going to
15        get to see a lot of them when you go back to the
16        jury room.  What you're going to see is there's not
17        a single Lorillard document in that pile of
18        documents.  Dr. Cummings never mentioned a single
19        Lorillard document.  Dr. Burns never mentioned a
20        single Lorillard document.
21             Now, there are three ads from Lorillard that
22        you're going to see for Kent smoking.  One from
23        1954, which is a decade or so before Mr. Tullo ever
24        smoked Kent, and the other two are from the late
25        1950s. 5169
 1             And I think there was one television clip with
 2        the Dick VanDyke show, about ten seconds, where it
 3        says "sponsored by Kent."  That's it.  That's the
 4        entire paper record in this case with respect to my
 5        client Lorillard and Kent cigarettes.  There's  6        nothing else.
 7             You will see a couple of documents I put into
 8        evidence with Dr. Cummings and Dr. Burns, and those
 9        were submissions by Lorillard to the
10        Surgeon General providing information to the
11        Surgeon General, submissions by Lorillard to the
12        Federal Trade Commission providing information to
13        the Federal Trade Commission with respect to
14        smoking and health.
15             But you're not going to see a single document
16        put in by any of the plaintiffs experts with
17        respect to Lorillard.  You saw a lot of other
18        documents in that case.
19             And, by the way, as Ms. Gallagher told you,
20        none of those documents you saw had anything to do
21        with Mr. Tullo.  That was when Ms. Gallagher was
22        talking about, I thought it was really good, when
23        she said we have a litigation world and we have the
24        Mr. Tullo world over here.
25             And all of those other documents from the 5170
 1        plaintiffs experts, from Dr. Cummings, are over
 2        here in in litigation world, they had nothing to do
 3        with Mr. Tullo.  4             With respect to my client, you don't even have
 5        to look at that because there's no documents any
 6        place with respect to my client.  And again, that
 7        may be why we received such scant attention in this
 8        case.
 9             I do want to talk to you a little bit about
10        filters.
11             Could you put up slide two for me?
12             You know, Mr. Hammer talked a lot about what
13        we called filter fraud and something about 50 years
14        ago the cigarette companies were defrauding the
15        public with respect to filters.
16             And Ms. Gallagher did a great job yesterday of
17        showing you literally seven, eight, nine, ten
18        publications that took place back then about
19        filters, about what the public health authorities
20        were suggesting about filters.  She showed you
21        articles from the mainstream press, Reader's
22        Digest, Time magazine, she showed you articles from
23        the scientific press, she showed you articles --
24        she showed you portions of Surgeon General reports,
25        all of whom were saying to smokers, hey, quit; if 5171
 1        you don't quit, cut back; and if you don't cut
 2        back, at least smoke a filtered cigarette.  All  3        related to the same concept Dr. Cummings was
 4        talking about, dose response, lower the dose of
 5        tar.
 6             So I'm not going to go back through all of
 7        those documents that Ms. Gallagher went through
 8        with you because I want to talk about my company --
 9        our company's filter, the Kent filter.
10             This is an article written by Dr. Wynder.  You
11        remember Dr. Wynder, he's the guy that Dr. Burns
12        and Dr. Cummings called like a giant in the
13        industry.  He was one of the leaders in this
14        industry with respect to smoking and health.  And
15        he was recommending filters all the way back now in
16        the '50s.
17             This is an article that he wrote recommending
18        filters.  And what he said was, you know, put a
19        filter on a regular-sized cigarette, and if you
20        reduce the tar down to 18 milligrams, a reduction
21        at that level has shown in both animal experiment
22        and human studies -- human statistical studies
23        would be followed by a significant risk reduction
24        in the cancer risk, providing that the number of
25        cigarette smoke just kept constant. 5172  1             That's what Dr. Wynder in the public health
 2        authority recommended, get that tar down to
 3        at least 18 milligrams.  Well -- can you put up the
 4        next slide.
 5             Do you remember Ms. Gallagher talked to you
 6        about the Federal Trade Commission setting up a
 7        testing procedure, an agreed-upon testing
 8        procedure, by the government, as to how they're
 9        going to test tar and nicotine.  And she went
10        through a number of documents with you about that.
11             Well, this is the very first report that came
12        out in 1967, right around the time that Mr. Tullo
13        was moving from Kent to Marlboro.  And notice what
14        the tar number is for Kent, the very cigarette that
15        Mr. Tullo had been smoking; 17.4 milligrams, below
16        what did Wynder was recommending for a significant
17        reduction in the risk of cancer.
18             Now, Ms. Gallagher showed you yesterday what
19        the numbers were for Parliament, which also meet
20        and exceeded the levels suggested by the public
21        health authorities during the period that Mr. Tullo
22        was smoking Parliament.
23             Mr. Hammer put on absolutely no evidence that
24        there was anything wrong with the Kent filter,
25        zero, none. 5173  1             He wants to stand up here and talk about,
 2        quote, filter fraud, but with respect to the
 3        filters on these very cigarettes that are at issue
 4        here, the Parliament filter that Ms. Gallagher
 5        talked to you about yesterday, and the Kent filter
 6        that I'm talking about today, all of the evidence
 7        is that those filters actually met the requirements
 8        and the suggestions of the public health authority,
 9        every one of them.
10             And Mr. Hammer has given you nothing --
11             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach a minute?
12             THE COURT:  Sure.
13             (Sidebar held as follows:)
14             MR. HAMMER:  If anything happens, I can't
15        refer to Ms. Gallagher, and I can't refer to her by
16        name, and yet he's using, and the defense now is
17        now referring to so, I mean --
18             THE COURT:  Going forward, say "counsel for
19        plaintiffs."
20             MR. BIDEAU:  I'm happy to do that.  I didn't
21        fix that up yet.  I apologize.
22             (Sidebar concluded and the following was held
23        in open court:)
24             MR. BIDEAU:  So plaintiffs to provide any
25        information that the actual filters in this case,   5174
 1        the Kent filter, the Parliament filter, didn't meet
 2        or exceed every suggestion by the public health
 3        authority.
 4             So they can throw around general statements
 5        and they can throw around little quips from ads,
 6        little quips from articles talk generally about
 7        filters.  But we're talking about Dominick Tullo.
 8             This is not the litigation world over here
 9        that Ms. Gallagher was talking about.  This is the
10        Dominick Tullo world.  We're talking about the
11        cigarettes that Dominick Tullo smoked.
12             And there's not a bit of evidence that the
13        filters on those cigarettes didn't do exactly what
14        the manufacturer said they were doing or what the
15        public health authority said they were doing.
16             Now, there was some discussion yesterday.
17             Can you put that last slide back up.  I'm
18        sorry, the one before that.
19             Ms. Gallagher talked to you a little bit
20        yesterday about the concept of compensation and she
21        went, again, through a whole lot of discussions
22        about that, and this last line really refers to the
23        issue of compensation.
24             And that was the issue Dr. Burns was talking 25        about when he said things like, well, one of the 5175
 1        reasons these filters don't work is smokers
 2        compensate, they smoke more cigarettes, they smoke
 3        differently, things like that.  And Ms. Gallagher
 4        showed you all of the articles, all of the letters,
 5        all of the studies that related to compensation.
 6             But in this case, not the case Dr. Burns was
 7        talking about, but in this case there's no
 8        evidence, as Ms. Gallagher pointed out to you,
 9        everybody's testimony, Dominick Tullo smoked the
10        same number of cigarettes, whether he was smoking
11        nonfiltered or filtered, and he smoked them the
12        same way.  There's simply no evidence of
13        compensation.
14             In fact, Dr. Burns actually acknowledged that
15        he didn't see any evidence of compensation in this
16        case one way or the other.  Then Dr. Burns talked
17        about the fact that, well, the cigarette companies
18        kind of hid the issue of compensation, that nobody
19        knew about compensation.
20             And again, Ms. Gallagher yesterday put up a
21        number of submissions that were done by the
22        cigarette companies to the government, she put up a
23        number of articles.  You just saw Dr. Wynder's 24        article about 1957; and Dr. Wynder's article is
25        talking about compensation, so it was well-known. 5176
 1             Can you put up slide 11 for me?
 2             This is Lorillard, my client's report to the
 3        Surgeon General in 1963.  And in that report my
 4        client is quoting from the Surgeon General Leroy
 5        Burney.  In a statement Surgeon General Burney made
 6        on November 28th of 1959, okay, in which he was
 7        talking about the fact that the Surgeon General was
 8        aware of the issue of compensation.
 9             So the notion that these tobacco companies
10        somehow hid the issue of compensation, again,
11        there's simply no facts in the record that would
12        support that.
13             THE CLERK:  Counselor, 15 minutes.
14             MR. BIDEAU:  Thank you.
15             Ladies and gentlemen let me remind you of one
16        thing in this case, plaintiffs have the burden to
17        prove their claim against each and every defendant,
18        they have to prove each and every claim against
19        each and every defendant.
20             The only thing plaintiffs told you in their
21        opening about my client was that Mr. Tullo smoked 22        some of my client's cigarettes.  In closing he told
23        you it was a really small amount of my client's
24        cigarettes, didn't smoke them for very long, that's
25        why we're here. 5177
 1             And so one of the things you're going to have
 2        to look at is did Lorillard do anything that caused
 3        or substantially contributed to Mr. Tullo's injury?
 4        I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, there's no
 5        facts in this case that would support that.
 6             Look, cigarettes are legal in this country,
 7        whether you like it or don't like it, cigarettes
 8        are legal, okay.  The law is that we can
 9        manufacture and sell cigarettes and the defendants
10        can't be liable just for selling cigarettes.
11             Ms. Gallagher talked to you yesterday about
12        the very first question on the verdict form:
13             Was Dominick Tullo addicted to cigarettes
14        containing nicotine; and, if so, was such addiction
15        a legal cause of his death?  And she explained to
16        you in great detail why the answer to that question
17        is "no," okay.
18             It was Dominick Tullo's decision to continue
19        smoking, that was the legal cause of his lung
20        cancer.  When you look at every question on the 21        verdict form, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to
22        see the phrase "legal cause."
23             Literally every question has the issue of
24        legal cause, okay.  You're going to have to find
25        legal cause for every question.  Ms. Gallagher told 5178
 1        you yesterday there's simply no basis for that.
 2        There is no basis in this evidence for you to find
 3        legal cause as to any of the questions on the
 4        verdict form, if you were to get by question one.
 5             And we agree with Ms. Gallagher that a "no" to
 6        question one, based on the evidence in this case,
 7        is the appropriate answer, and at that point you
 8        don't go any further.
 9             I do want to talk just for a minute about the
10        issue of punitive damages.  Now, I don't think you
11        ever get there, so again, for all the reasons
12        Ms. Gallagher said.  And as she told you, the law
13        that you -- burden of proof of punitive damages is
14        clear and convincing evidence, it's a higher
15        standard to which you judge this part of the case
16        on.
17             If you look at the evidence, ladies and
18        gentlemen, there is no conduct by Lorillard or, 19        frankly, there's no conduct by any of the
20        defendants in this case that would satisfy that
21        high standard, and certainly none that effected
22        Dominick Tullo.
23             There's not a shred of evidence that Dominick
24        Tullo ever took any action or failed to take any
25        action based on anything Lorillard did or said. 5179
 1        They haven't even shown you any documents that
 2        related to Dominick Tullo.  They haven't shown you
 3        any Lorillard documents.  There are no internal
 4        Lorillard documents in this record to contradict
 5        anything Lorillard was saying publicly, there's
 6        nothing there.
 7             He smoked Kent for just a few years and the
 8        Kent cigarette that he smoked met or exceeded all
 9        of the recommendations in the public health
10        authorities, like Dr. Wynder, in reducing tar.  And
11        in short, ladies and gentlemen, there's no basis
12        for you to find an entitlement to punitive damages
13        on my client, if you ever got to that last
14        question.
15             Well, I heard Gina say I was already at 15
16        minutes, so my time's about up here today.  I do
17        want to thank you for your time, for your effort 18        and for your patience.
19             Now, when we all sit down -- Mr. Geise is
20        last -- when we all sit down plaintiffs get to get
21        up and give you rebuttal argument and we don't get
22        to get up after that and put into context what
23        plaintiffs talk about; so, what I would like you to
24        do is, as you listen to plaintiffs counsel when
25        they get up and talk about their rebuttal, if they 5180
 1        show you documents, if they talk about pieces of
 2        testimony, please look at that -- those documents
 3        and think whether those documents relate in any way
 4        to Dominick Tullo, think about whether those -- any
 5        of the testimony that he talks about relate to
 6        Dominick Tullo, think about the timing, what's the
 7        date of the document and what was Dominick Tullo
 8        doing at that point in time.
 9             Because based on the evidence you have in this
10        record, there is the litigation world over here,
11        and none of that related to Dominick Tullo.  So
12        we'd ask you, since we don't get to get up again,
13        if you would please just take a look at the
14        documents, take a look at the evidence and put them
15        in context for us. 16             Every witness has told you that Dominick Tullo
17        was an intelligent guy, he was a strong guy, he was
18        a guy who didn't like his decisions questioned, and
19        he's a guy who knew how to make decisions.
20             There is nothing, folks, that Lorillard or any
21        of these defendants could have done or said that
22        would have changed any decision that Dominick Tullo
23        made.  Thank you.


17             MR. GEISE:  Counsel, Mrs. Tullo.
18             Good morning, once again.  I had good
19        afternoon because I thought we were going to get to
20        this point yesterday, but we didn't.  We are 21        nearing the end.
22             You remember in opening statements it
23        coincided with opening day for baseball.  And I
24        think now we can say we're in the ninth inning or
25        maybe we're into the tenth inning now since we have 5192
 1        kicked over to this morning.
 2             You have been incredibly punctual throughout
 3        this whole trial.  I think this is the rare trial
 4        where we have never had to wait on a juror once.
 5        Now, I know you all have had to wait on us
 6        sometimes when we're in here taking care of legal
 7        issues, and we thank you very much for your
 8        patience.
 9             We've tried to move this trial as quickly as
10        possible because we know how important your time is
11        and how you've dedicated to the jury process.  And
12        your civic sacrifice that you have made the last
13        three weeks is something that we cannot pay back to
14        you as much as we should.  Thank you.
15             And you know by now that the eight of you are
16        the judges of the facts.  And when it comes to my
17        client, the facts are critically important.
18             And the plaintiff has the burden to prove 19        those facts.  And I realize memories fade and it's
20        hard to recall things that happened 50, 60, 70
21        years ago.  But inside a courtroom, in a lawsuit to
22        recover money, the plaintiff has the burden of
23        proof.  Hazy memories don't suffice.  Only proof
24        does.
25             And I asked you at the beginning of this case 5193
 1        to demand proof, don't accept punches and
 2        suspicions and could-be's; demand proof.  And proof
 3        is evidence you hear from the witnesses.  And in
 4        this case there is very little proof about the
 5        smoking history of Mr. Tullo of my client's brands.
 6             My client's brands that Mr. Tullo is said to
 7        have smoked are Lucky Strike, Camel and Pall Mall,
 8        and I want to talk about the evidence about those
 9        three.
10             You heard that Mrs. Tullo saw Mr. Tullo smoke
11        a Lucky Strike cigarette in the neighborhood when
12        they were about 11 or 12 years old.  And from that
13        Mr. Hammer wants you to assume that from the
14        mid-1930s until the mid-1940s Mr. Tullo smoked
15        Lucky Strike.  The problem is that's not what the
16        evidence is in this case.
17             Now, first of all, it's important to remember 18        that these are events that took place 75 years ago.
19        And as Mrs. Tullo told Mr. Hammer her memory isn't
20        that great, and that's understandable.  Who can
21        remember what happened that long ago?
22             And Mrs. Tullo also told you that when they
23        met they were kids, they were both in school and
24        they didn't see each other that much, and you heard
25        yesterday she doesn't know why Dominick Tullo 5194
 1        started smoking and she doesn't know why he started
 2        smoking Lucky Strike.  She doesn't know.  No proof.
 3             Now, then we hear Dominick Tullo goes away to
 4        the army and he comes back and when he returns they
 5        start dating.  And she believes that by that time
 6        in 1947 he's smoking Chesterfield.  We don't know
 7        what he was smoking when he was in the army.  No
 8        proof.
 9             Now, Mrs. Tullo assumes that he quit smoking
10        Lucky Strike and went to Chesterfield.  But look at
11        what Dr. Cummings said.
12             Can I have number three, please?
13             This is evidence in this case.  He was asked:
14        So she doesn't know how long he smoked Lucky
15        Strike? 16             And she also said that there could have been
17        many cigarette brands in between Lucky Strike and
18        Chesterfield, correct?
19             And the answer is:  That's right.
20             That's the evidence.
21             And you also heard -- contrary to I think what
22        was in Mr. Hammer's closing yesterday -- that
23        Mrs. Tullo does not know how long Mr. Tullo smoked
24        Lucky Strike.
25             Can we see number two? 5195
 1             The question:  How long do you recall
 2        Mr. Tullo smoking Lucky Strikes?
 3             That I can't answer.
 4             This, ladies and gentlemen, is the evidence in
 5        this case.  She doesn't know how long, she doesn't
 6        know how many, and you can't assume that it's
 7        something different than the evidence.  They have
 8        to prove it, and they didn't.
 9             And Mrs. Tullo is the only person you heard
10        from who mentioned that Mr. Tullo smoked Lucky
11        Strike.  That's it.  No other family member, no
12        other friend, no one saw him, no one ever heard him
13        say that he did.
14             Now, with regard to this period of time, 15        Mr. Hammer made a point yesterday that Dominick
16        Tullo was addicted in the '30s and '40s.
17             And this remind me of something my two boys
18        would say if I said that to them, they'd say
19        "really?"
20             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, objection.  May I
21        approach?
22             (Sidebar held as follows:)
23             MR. HAMMER:  He refers to his --
24             MR. GEISE:  I will move on.
25             THE COURT:  You will move on, okay. 5196
 1             (Sidebar concluded and the following was held
 2        in open court:)
 3             MR. GEISE:  With regard to this period of
 4        time, the question is how is Mr. Hammer so sure
 5        when his own expert Dr. Burns isn't?
 6             Can I see number four, please?
 7             Dr. Burns was asked:  Now, as to when
 8        Mr. Tullo became addicted, you don't have a
 9        specific age or year that you think he became
10        addicted, correct?
11             No, we don't have much description in detail
12        of his smoking behaviors as an adolescent and young 13        man and, therefore, there's no way to know with any
14        reasonable certainty precisely when that happened.
15             You can't even say for sure whether he was
16        addicted before he got married in 1947.
17             Answer:  I can't say with certainty, that's
18        correct.
19             When your expert said there's no way to know
20        and can't say it with certainty, you haven't met
21        your burden of proof on that fact.
22             Next brand, Pall Mall.  You heard from
23        Mr. Tullo's daughter, Stephanie Casino, that she
24        recalls Mr. Tullo smoking a Camel cigarette when
25        she was 6 or 7 years old in 1957 or 1958 when they 5197
 1        lived in that house on East 45th Street with a
 2        number of relatives, a number of relatives who also
 3        smoked.
 4             And she told you she doesn't know how long he
 5        smoked Camel and she doesn't know how many Camels
 6        he smoked.  And that's fair.
 7             Stephanie Casino is the only person who
 8        identified Camel as a brand that Mr. Tullo smoked.
 9        And you need to ask yourself, her brother, Louis
10        Tullo, didn't identify it.  And, more importantly,
11        Mrs. Tullo never identified Camel as a brand that 12        Mr. Tullo smoked.
13             So you need to ask yourself as the judges of
14        the facts what makes sense to you, the recollection
15        of a 6-year-old from 50 years ago or the woman that
16        lived with him for over 50 years.  Because the only
17        evidence about Camel smoking is from the
18        6-year-old, not his wife from over 50 years.
19             The last brand that Mr. Tullo is said to have
20        smoked from my client is Pall Mall, and again,
21        Mrs. Tullo can't remember when he smoked Pall Mall.
22        Now, you heard that he may have smoked Pall Mall
23        cigarettes because they were a longer cigarette.
24             Dr. Cummings told you that.  And Dr. Cummings
25        said if he wanted a longer cigarette, that's what 5198
 1        he got with Pall Mall, it was five millimeters
 2        longer than the other cigarettes.
 3             Mrs. Tullo doesn't recall exactly how long
 4        Mr. Tullo smoked Pall Mall, but she thinks it was
 5        between three to five years.  And during that
 6        period of time she doesn't know how many cigarettes
 7        he smoked per day.
 8             Can I see number six, please?
 9             This is her testimony:  So, can you tell us, 10        in terms of Pall Malls, do you know how many
11        cigarettes of Pall Mall he would smoke in a day?
12             Answer:  I would -- no.
13             It's not one pack per day, it's not two packs
14        per day.  It's "I don't know."  That is the
15        evidence in this case.  And just like Lucky Strike
16        and just like Camel, only one witness testified
17        about Pall Mall history.
18             Now, I did a chart trying to keep track of
19        these histories throughout trial, and I want to
20        look at that now.  Can I see number seven, please.
21        This is a chart of the different brands that we
22        heard somebody say did Mr. Tullo smoke.
23             And Mrs. Tullo told you the order was Lucky
24        Strike, Chesterfield, Kent, Marlboro, and
25        Parliament, and then I added the Camel from 5199
 1        Stephanie Casino.
 2             If you look at this, Mrs. Tullo said that
 3        Pall Mall was after Chesterfield, Kent and Marlboro
 4        and before Parliament.  But her daughter and her
 5        son don't remember that.  Ask yourself, isn't it
 6        odd that three people living in the same house and
 7        only one of them recalls the brand?
 8             And especially with Stephanie Casino, she 9        remembers a Camel cigarette when she's 6, but
10        doesn't remember three to five years of Pall Mall
11        when she's a teenager?
12             In his testimony Dr. Cummings talks about the
13        importance of unanimous testimony, I don't know if
14        you all remember that, he says it's when multiple
15        people see the same thing.  Well, what does it mean
16        when it's not unanimous?
17             And there was one other witness in this case
18        who's not on this chart right now who told us about
19        Dominick Tullo's smoking history, and that was
20        Dominick Tullo himself.  He didn't take the witness
21        stand, unfortunately, he's not here, but he did
22        speak to us through documents that were created
23        when he was alive.
24             You saw three surveys that the Tullos sent in
25        to Philip Morris, and the surveys asked about 5200
 1        smoking history, asked about things that are
 2        important in this case.  Mr. Hammer talked about
 3        The Frank Statement.  I'll represent, these are
 4        Dominick's statements about his smoking history.
 5        And there were three of them.
 6             Now, if we can look at the first one, number 7        eight, please, he identifies his current brand of
 8        cigarettes, Parliament, and the previous brand,
 9        Marlboro.
10             Can we look at the second one, please.
11             He identifies his current brand of cigarettes,
12        again, Parliament, and his previous brand
13        Chesterfield.
14             Can we see the third one, please?
15             Current brand, Parliament, previous brand,
16        Kent.
17             Mrs. Tullo told you that Pall Mall was the
18        cigarette before Parliament.  Kent, Chesterfield,
19        Marlboro before Pall Mall, Parliament after.  Does
20        that make sense?
21             Can I see number 11, please?
22             Dominick Tullo, when he identified his current
23        brand as Parliament, he identified his previous
24        brands as Kent, Chesterfield and Marlboro.  He
25        never said his previous brand was Pall Mall.  Did 5201
 1        he forget?  Not once, but three times when he had
 2        the opportunity, that's the evidence in this case.
 3             And I submit to you that the surveys that the
 4        Tullos sent in to Philip Morris were surveys sent
 5        in before there was a lawsuit to recover money. 6        And I think you need to consider that as you judge
 7        the facts.
 8             Because if you believe Dominick Tullo and his
 9        children, he didn't smoke Lucky Strike, he didn't
10        smoke Camel and he didn't smoke Pall Mall.  That is
11        the evidence.
12             Can you take that down?  Thank you.
13             Now, if you accept the biggest possible
14        smoking history for the Reynolds brands, you get
15        Mrs. Tullo's uncorroborated testimony that it's
16        about three to five years max.
17             Now, we've heard about Dr. Burns and his chart
18        and the proportion and that, so I'm not going to
19        repeat what you heard about that.  But Dr. Burns
20        didn't tell you anything about the brands.  He
21        didn't offer even a guess about the proportion.
22             But the problem for the plaintiff in this case
23        is Dr. Cummings did.  Dr. Cummings did talk about
24        it.  And you don't need to take my word about the
25        smoking history.  We can take Dr. Cummings' word. 5202
 1        And remember how hard it is to get Dr. Cummings to
 2        agree to anything?  It was tough.
 3             Can I see number 12, please. 4             This is what I asked him.  So if we add those
 5        together, Mr. Tullo's smoking history of those
 6        three brands is less than five years, isn't it?
 7             And originally said:  I wouldn't agree with
 8        that, we just don't know.
 9             Now, we don't know doesn't equal evidence, but
10        he said "we just don't know."  So I followed up:
11             And because no one can recall, there's no
12        evidence in the record that you reviewed that it's
13        greater than five years, correct?
14             And he said:  That's true.
15             Dr. Cummings telling this is significant about
16        a smoking history that is insignificant.  And
17        Mr. Bideau and Mr. Rosenstein touched on it, and
18        it's the next point from Dr. Cummings.
19             Could I have number 14, please?
20             It's the pack-year threshold.  Dr. Cummings
21        says that you need a ten-pack year threshold for an
22        increased risk.  And Dr. Cummings admits that the
23        maximum Reynolds smoking history is five; and
24        that's if you believe the testimony, it's five.  It
25        comes nowhere near the threshold, not at all. 5203
 1             According to Dr. Cummings, the risk from
 2        smoking Reynolds cigarettes is minimum, and it's 3        that of a person who has never smoked, and it's far
 4        short of the threshold needed to cause disease.
 5             Now, why is that important?  Why is that
 6        important?  Well, it's important because of the
 7        concept of legal cause.  Other folks have addressed
 8        that before, I'm not going to dwell on it.
 9             I agree with Ms. Gallagher, that addiction is
10        not the legal cause of Mr. Tullo's lung cancer and
11        death.  In addition, Reynolds smoking history is
12        not the legal cause.  They are not the but for
13        cause, because the evidence does not support the
14        conclusion that but for smoking Reynolds brands
15        Mr. Tullo would have avoided lung cancer.
16             So your answer on the verdict form to every
17        question that asks you about legal cause should be
18        "no."
19             The Engle findings, they're in the jury
20        instructions that you have, they were read to you
21        yesterday.  The one thing that's very important
22        about that is there's an instruction that do not
23        mean that the plaintiff is entitled to prevail in
24        this case.  The plaintiff has to do more.
25             The plaintiff has to take the findings, you 5204 1        have to apply the evidence, and then you have to
 2        decide if the plaintiff met her burden that the
 3        defendants conduct was a legal cause of Mr. Tullo's
 4        smoking and ultimately his death at age 74.
 5             Now, as I mentioned in my opening statement, I
 6        like to picture the findings as kind of being in
 7        that parking garage across the street, and there's
 8        the walkway and there's the courthouse on this side
 9        of the street after the walkway.  And the
10        plaintiffs have to take and they have to build that
11        walkway with evidence to connect the findings in
12        the garage to the testimony and the facts in this
13        courtroom.
14             And I submit that they have not done that.
15        They didn't build that walkway.  They're still in
16        that parking garage, with lots of documents, but no
17        connection to Dominick Tullo.
18             Mr. Hammer spent a great deal of time
19        yesterday talking about filter fraud and the
20        illusion of filtration and my bet is he's going to
21        spend some more on it when I'm done today.
22             I'm not going to touch the filter fraud
23        argument.  And I'm not going to touch it for one
24        simple reason, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, and Camel
25        are all unfiltered cigarettes.  So the part where 5205 1        he talks about filter fraud, I don't have anything
 2        to respond to there.
 3             During this trial, through the great help of
 4        Dr. Cummings, the plaintiffs picked from about 60
 5        million tobacco company documents to show you some,
 6        and they picked the worst ones to put on display
 7        here, the dirtiest of the dirty laundry you can
 8        imagine to air out in front of the jury.
 9             Mr. Hammer talked a lot about the American
10        public.  It's critically important for you to
11        remember that this case is not about the American
12        public.  This case is about Mr. Tullo.
13             And what that means is you have to determine
14        what any of those documents had to do with
15        Mr. Tullo.  The plaintiffs have to build a walkway
16        from each of those documents to Mr. Tullo, and they
17        didn't do that.
18             Specifically, the Court instructed you on the
19        issue of concealment, and it talks about they have
20        to prove that Mr. Tullo reasonably relied to
21        detriment on a statement.
22             First of all, there's no evidence that
23        Mr. Tullo heard, read or saw any statement from a
24        tobacco company.
25             Can I see number 18, please.  5206
 1             This is the evidence in this case.
 2             Doctor, my question is that there has been no
 3        testimony in this case that Mr. Tullo heard, read
 4        or saw any particular statement by a tobacco
 5        company.
 6             That's true.
 7             You have no information from the testimony in
 8        this case to indicate that Mr. Tullo ever saw or
 9        heard any of the video clips that you played to
10        this jury?
11             Answer:  Either way, that's true.
12             And for Reynolds, there's no evidence that he
13        heard or saw anything from Reynolds.
14             Can I have number 19.
15             Did your husband ever tell you that he had
16        ever heard, read or seen any statements from
17        RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company?
18             Answer:  I never heard.
19             That is the evidence.  There was no evidence
20        that anything Reynolds did or any of the other
21        tobacco companies did had any impact on Mr. Tullo's
22        decisions.  There's no evidence that he ever relied
23        on anything Reynolds said.  And similarly, there's
24        no proof he relied on something Reynolds didn't 25        say. 5207
 1             Without hearing, without seeing, without
 2        reading, and most of all without relying, they
 3        can't build that bridge.  And when you get to
 4        questions five and six, specifically, where you're
 5        asked whether Dominick Tullo reasonably relied to
 6        his detriment on any statement, your answer for all
 7        of the companies has to be "no."  That is the
 8        evidence.  If he didn't see it and he didn't rely
 9        on it, it has to be a "no."
10             This case isn't about somebody else in the
11        American public.  This case is about Dominick
12        Tullo, and this case is about the evidence about
13        Dominick Tullo.
14             Now, the plaintiffs theory is that if Reynolds
15        or somebody else had said something publicly that
16        was in an internal document that might have made a
17        difference to Mr. Tullo, he might have quit.  Well,
18        "might" doesn't cut it.  They got to go the next
19        step and say it would have made a difference,
20        absolutely.  And they've put on no evidence to
21        prove that either.
22             And ask yourself, does it make any sense to
23        say that there's Reynolds or anybody else that said 24        smoking causes lung cancer, that it would have made
25        a difference to his decision?  Of course not. 5208
 1             Mr. Tullo was not the kind of guy that
 2        listened to anybody; not the media, not his wife,
 3        and certainly not a tobacco company.  You heard
 4        that Mr. and Mrs. Tullo had a fabulous marriage, a
 5        terrific marriage.  But if you don't care what your
 6        spouse tells you over and over for four to five
 7        decades, do you think a different statement from a
 8        stranger is going to matter?  Of course not.
 9             Now, I want to talk briefly about some of the
10        Reynolds documents that Dr. Cummings showed you.
11        And in those documents, were some stupid statements
12        made?  Yes, absolutely.
13             On your verdict form, is there a question
14        whether stupid statements were made?  No.
15             And is there a connection between any
16        statement and document and Dominick Tullo?  No.
17             Dr. Cummings' presentation of the documents is
18        meant to be an invitation to ignore the facts of
19        Dominick Tullo's smoking history and focus instead
20        on the extraneous, on the irrelevant and the
21        prejudicial. 22             Dr. Cummings combs his archives and looks for
23        the most inflammatory statement to put before you,
24        but as I showed you, there isn't a bit of evidence
25        that Mr. Tullo saw any of the documents, saw any of 5209
 1        the ads, saw any of the statements; and, moreover,
 2        there's no evidence that any of the internal
 3        documents would have impacted his decisions if he
 4        had them in front of him to read.  There's no
 5        evidence.
 6             Now, I want to mention a couple examples about
 7        Reynolds documents.  Remember the 1990 letter to an
 8        elementary school principal in Western New York?
 9             Could I have number 20, please.
10             This is what I asked Dr. Cummings:  Now, in
11        1990, Mr. Tullo was retired, on Medicaid, living in
12        Florida, correct?
13             That's right.
14             He wasn't in elementary school at Willow Ridge
15        in Amherst, New York, was he?
16             No.
17             He never lived in Amherst, New York, did he?
18             No.
19             And Mr. Tullo never saw this letter, did he?
20             No. 21             And what Dr. Cummings' testimony about that
22        letter prove?  Well, it proved Reynolds didn't sell
23        candy cigarettes, Reynolds didn't sell toys,
24        Reynolds didn't sell video games.  But it was a
25        document generated by Dr. Cummings, went to the 5210
 1        school, he encouraged it, so that he could bring it
 2        with him every time he testifies.
 3             It doesn't matter who the plaintiff is.  It
 4        doesn't matter how old the plaintiff is in 1990.
 5        It doesn't matter where they lived; any trial, any
 6        time, anywhere is good enough for Dr. Cummings.
 7             There was a document from 1973.  Now, this is
 8        a decade or so after Mr. Tullo's stopped smoking my
 9        client's products, it's a decade later.  So what it
10        could have to do, I'm not sure, but in 1973 there's
11        a document talking about future brands for a
12        quote/unquote youth market.
13             In 1973, Mr. Tullo was 50.  Now I know we're
14        aging gracefully now, and 50 isn't as old as it
15        used to be, but 50's not a youth.
16             Dr. Cummings takes these documents from
17        courtroom to courtroom to inflame you, not to
18        inform you.  And there's some documents that they 19        do inform, but only when you get the whole story.
20             Dr. Teague, 1953, Mr. Hammer mentioned it
21        yesterday in his closing -- and you may see it
22        again when I sit down -- it's a review of published
23        literature done by an employee at Reynolds.
24             Can I have number 21, please.
25             This is the question I asked Dr. Cummings: 5211
 1             And all of the literature -- all 78
 2        references, it will be in evidence, go look at it,
 3        78 references -- all of the literature that was
 4        reviewed in this document had been published and
 5        publicly available and accessible to anyone that
 6        wanted to access it, correct?
 7             Yes.
 8             It was available to the Surgeon General?
 9             Yes, it was.
10             It was available to the National Cancer
11        Institute?
12             Correct.
13             Anyone could have done this research?
14             Yes.  Anyone.
15             Anyone could have gone down to the public
16        library and done the same thing Dr. Teague did in
17        1953. 18             None of the information was secret.  None of
19        it was concealed from the public.  In fact,
20        Dr. Teague got his information from the public.
21             There was another document, a 1959 document
22        from Mr. Rodgman where Dr. Rodgman observed eight
23        of the polycyclic hydrocarbons isolated from the
24        smoke are known to produce cancer in mice.
25             So the thought is Reynolds knows in 1959 there 5212
 1        are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarettes.
 2        It's got to be a secret to Reynolds, right?  No.
 3             Remember I showed you it was in Reader's
 4        Digest the same month?
 5             Can I see the next slide, please.
 6             I asked Dr. Cummings:  So, obviously, eight
 7        polycyclic hydrocarbons were not secret to Reynolds
 8        in 1959, correct?
 9             No.
10             They were known in the medical literature and
11        in the public literature?
12             Yes.  I wasn't aware of the citation in the
13        Reader's Digest, but Reader's Digest usually
14        reports in lay terms what's in the medical
15        literature. 16             So why come before you and tell you that this
17        is something that was not available to the public
18        when I have to be the one to show them, oh, really,
19        it's in Reader's Digest the same month.
20             Mr. Hammer told you Dr. Cummings is biased.
21        Folks, that's bias gone too far, if you ask me.
22             The last Reynolds document I want to talk
23        about is another one from the 1970's, again, long
24        after he stopped smoking my product.  But
25        Dr. Cummings talked about it, so I feel like I need 5213
 1        to address it a little bit and put it in the proper
 2        context.
 3             It's one that I think it's been said it's
 4        evidence that Reynolds manipulated nicotine, to
 5        have the right amount of nicotine to keep smokers
 6        smoking, and that sounds pretty sinister.
 7             But the story we got from Dr. Cummings and
 8        Dr. Farone tells you something about that document
 9        that isn't so sinister.  And the story is that
10        Reynolds scientists were aware of the
11        recommendations from the public health community
12        and were acting on those recommendations.
13             Now, in the document, Dr. Teague talks about
14        changing the tar-to-nicotine ratio.  And what he is 15        saying is if you lower the tar in a cigarette and
16        keep nicotine the same, you change the ratio.
17             And the thought is, if smokers are smoking to
18        get nicotine, if they have a level of nicotine they
19        have to get, if they want a dose they're searching
20        for, if they get that dose and get less tar, that
21        could be better for them, because the tar's the
22        stuff that they think causes cancer and tar's the
23        bad stuff they're trying to eliminate.
24             So if you can get the nicotine and get less
25        tar, that can be a good thing.  Now, is this an 5214
 1        idea known only to Dr. Teague and only to Reynolds?
 2        No.  Let's look at who else had this idea.
 3             Dr. Michael Russell.
 4             Can I see number 25?
 5             I talked to Dr. Cummings about this:
 6             So, when Dr. Teague is talking about reducing
 7        the tar to nicotine ratio in this document, he's
 8        talking about keeping the same level of nicotine
 9        while reducing the tar, right.
10             Among other things, he's talking about that,
11        yes.
12             It was a strategy that had been discussed by 13        scientists like Dr. Russell and other members of
14        the public health community for potentially making
15        cigarettes safer?
16             Answer:  Yes.
17             Who else?  How about the Surgeon General, the
18        highest public health official in the country.
19             May I have 26, please.
20             Well, you're familiar that in 1981 the Surgeon
21        General's report discussed the idea of changing the
22        tar-to-nicotine ratio as a potential approach for
23        making a safer cigarette?
24             Yes.
25             The Surgeon General's report reviewed the 5215
 1        literature, some of which came out in the '70s.
 2        And specifically, the 1981 Surgeon General's
 3        report, this is a report that Dr. Burns was
 4        involved in, and they agreed with this approach.
 5        And they weren't alone.
 6             May I have slide 27.
 7             This is from Dr. Farone, another person,
 8        another witness, another expert called by the
 9        plaintiffs, and he was asked:
10             During the course of the tobacco working
11        group -- and you remember, the tobacco working 12        group was a group of people from the National
13        Cancer Institute and the tobacco companies working
14        together toward a safer cigarette.  That's what the
15        tobacco working group is.
16             And during the course of the tobacco working
17        group's efforts to develop a less hazardous
18        cigarette, one of their suggestions was to increase
19        the tar -- I'm sorry -- to increase the nicotine
20        levels as relative to the tar to give people the
21        nicotine that they wanted, right?
22             Yes.
23             And the thought was that they want nicotine,
24        let's give them the nicotine, but let's try to
25        reduce the level of tar because tar is the stuff 5216
 1        that causes cancer, right?
 2             Right.
 3             And that's an idea that you support, right?
 4             Yes.
 5             Dr. Farone supports it, the 1981 Surgeon
 6        General's report with Dr. Burns supports it.
 7             And the other thing you heard is until 2000,
 8        until the year 2000, after Dominick Tullo had
 9        developed lung cancer, Dr. Cummings himself 10        continued to advocate increasing the level of
11        nicotine in cigarettes.
12             Now, that is the evidence in this courtroom.
13        If all of these public health officials and
14        organizations are touting an idea to make
15        cigarettes less hazardous, is it a surprise that
16        the idea was discussed in a document that Reynolds
17        had?
18             It's far from negligent for a cigarette
19        manufacturer to pay attention to what's going on in
20        the public health community about cigarettes.  And,
21        in fact, I think Dr. Cummings --
22             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach?
23             THE COURT:  Sure.
24             (Sidebar held as follows:)
25             MR. HAMMER:  That comment by saying "it's far 5217
 1        from negligent" is challenging the finding.  The
 2        finding is they are negligent.  It's an improper
 3        argument, and I request the Court to cure that.
 4             MR. GEISE:  I think it's very similar to what
 5        Mr. Hammer said, saying "is this negligent," I
 6        don't know, what, maybe he was challenging the
 7        findings, I'm not sure.
 8             MR. HAMMER:  No, Judge.  When I was saying 9        "this is negligent," and I went to the findings,
10        and yes, of course it is.
11             THE COURT:  You can suggest this, and let's
12        just move on.
13             MR. GEISE:  I will clear that up and tell them
14        the findings has negligence.
15             (Sidebar concluded and the following was held
16        in open court:)
17             MR. GEISE:  The findings you have say that the
18        tobacco companies are negligent.  I'm not
19        challenging that.
20             But I don't think you can challenge what's in
21        a document when Reynolds has the same thing that
22        the public health community is advocating.
23             And as a matter of fact, Dr. Cummings would
24        probably have been here criticizing Reynolds if
25        they didn't have that in their documents. 5218
 1             THE CLERK:  Ten minutes left.
 2             MR. GEISE:  The idea wasn't a secret.  It
 3        wasn't concealed from the public.  The public
 4        health community not only knew about it, but they
 5        proposed it, and now 40 years later Reynolds is
 6        criticized for being right on par with the public 7        health community.
 8             If Reynolds did something wrong with that,
 9        then Mr. Bideau and Mr. Rosenstein need to slide on
10        over and we better make room for Dr. Russell, for
11        the National Cancer Institute and the
12        Surgeon General.
13             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can we approach?
14             THE COURT:  Sure.
15             (Sidebar held as follows:)
16             MR. HAMMER:  That's an improper argument;
17        saying that other people should be defendants,
18        that's an improper argument, that's exactly what he
19        just said, that they should slide over and other
20        people be sitting here.
21             THE COURT:  That's what the issue, based on
22        that document, based on the information, based on
23        that in this lawsuit, just similar, that this based
24        on that document.
25             MR. GEISE:  Okay, all right. 5219
 1             (Sidebar concluded and the following was held
 2        in open court:)
 3             MR. GEISE:  Ladies and gentlemen, my last
 4        statement about the National Cancer Institute and
 5        the Surgeon General and Dr. Russell was limited to 6        the last document where Dr. Teague had the same
 7        thing that they were proposing.
 8             I'm going to talk just for a second about
 9        punitive damages.  I don't think you should get to
10        the consideration of punitive damages, that's
11        probably not a surprise; and if you do, you need to
12        remember that the burden of proof is even higher,
13        it's clear and convincing evidence for punitive
14        damages.
15             But I want to discuss one thing Mr. Hammer
16        brought up yesterday in his argument in support of
17        why you should find punitive damages, and that was
18        in 1994 testimony by tobacco executives in front of
19        Congress.
20             And, in particular, he played a video that had
21        the CEO for Reynolds who said he disagreed that
22        cigarettes and nicotine was addictive, using the
23        classic definition of addiction, which required
24        intoxication.  That's what was on the clip.
25             Now, I want to look at testimony you've seen 5220
 1        in this case.
 2             Can I see number 28.
 3             This is a question asked in the case:  If the 4        definition used in 1964 had been used in the 1988
 5        report, then once again cigarettes and the nicotine
 6        in them would not have been found to be addictive,
 7        correct?
 8             And the answer is:  Right.
 9             If the requirement was that it caused
10        intoxication, then one wouldn't have labeled
11        nicotine addiction, you know, nicotine as
12        addictive.
13             Now, from what Mr. Hammer said, you would
14        assume this is probably testimony from one of the
15        tobacco company employees, right?  No.
16             It was testimony from Dr. Cummings.  He told
17        you about the changing definition.  He told you
18        about the classic definition.  And he told you that
19        under that classic definition it requires
20        intoxication; and if you still use that definition,
21        it doesn't meet it.
22             Now, it's not clear and convincing evidence in
23        support of punitive damages when the plaintiffs
24        expert says the same thing.
25             Now, there is one thing you probably noticed 5221
 1        throughout the morning, there are a number of
 2        things that Mr. Hammer and I disagree about. 3             One thing we do agree on is what he said
 4        yesterday, that this case is all about money.
 5             You can take that down.  Thank you.
 6             They have suggested to you to award an
 7        enormous amount of money against the defendant and
 8        specifically against Reynolds, despite the fact
 9        that Mr. Tullo smoked our cigarettes for no more
10        than five years.
11             And I agree with Ms. Gallagher, and I also
12        take the position that Reynolds shouldn't be liable
13        and shouldn't pay Mrs. Tullo any money whatsoever
14        for that limited smoking history.
15             Mr. Hammer told you that they accept
16        responsibility, partial responsibility for Dominick
17        Tullo's lung cancer and death.
18             Now, you never heard any witness on the stand
19        say that they take partial responsibility.  I
20        submit to you that this is a game lawyers play.
21             MR. HAMMER:  Judge, objection.
22             (Sidebar held as follows:)
23             THE COURT:  What's the --
24             MR. HAMMER:  You know, is there was a motion
25        in limine filed by defense counsel saying they 5222 1        can't denigrate defense counsel telling this jury
 2        that we're playing games, that's about as
 3        denigrating as you can get.  They're violating
 4        their own motion on this Court's order.
 5             MR. GEISE:  I'm not aware of the order or
 6        motion that he's referring to them violating.  I
 7        don't think I'm violating anything.  This is
 8        closing argument.  I think that's an absolutely
 9        fair statement.
10             MR. HAMMER:  Saying that plaintiffs counsel is
11        playing a game in this court?
12             MR. GEISE:  With regard to accepting
13        responsibility.
14             MR. HAMMER:  No, that's calling what we're
15        doing, challenging, not challenging, it's
16        denigrating, what you're doing, which is exactly
17        what --
18             THE COURT:  I will sustain the objection.
19             MR. HAMMER:  I would like a curative on that,
20        Judge.  That has to have a curative.  That's a
21        distinct violation of this Court's order.
22             THE COURT:  We'll deal with it.
23             (Sidebar concluded and the following was held
24        in open court:)
25             MR. GEISE:  As I was saying, you heard 5223 1        Mr. Hammer say Mrs. Tullo accepts partial
 2        responsibility for Dominick Tullo, but you didn't
 3        hear Mrs. Tullo say that on the witness stand.
 4             The plaintiff wants to accept responsibility
 5        here while using the concept of addiction to paint
 6        Mr. Tullo as a powerless individual.
 7             But if you think the concept of addiction is
 8        an excuse for your actions, then don't accept
 9        responsibility for that.  You can't have it both
10        ways.
11             Mr. Hammer talked a number of times yesterday
12        about heroin users and heroin addicts.  If a heroin
13        addict goes on a binge and overdoses after decades
14        of warnings from the people closest to them, is the
15        heroin addict partially responsible or responsible?
16        You can't just accept some responsibility.
17             Now, from what we've heard and learned about
18        Dominick Tullo in this case, how do you think he
19        would have answered the question on responsibility?
20             Would this gentleman who was his own man say
21        someone or something else was in control of his
22        decisions?  Or would he say I am responsible?
23             We saw lots of pictures of Dominick Tullo
24        throughout his life, from a young man, from a shoe
25        shine boy growing up, getting married, having  5224
 1        children, having grandchildren, going to his
 2        granddaughter's weddings, we saw beautiful pictures
 3        of a man who lived a full and complete life.  And
 4        the pictures depict a man who did what he wanted to
 5        do and enjoyed.
 6             But beyond the photographs, we got another
 7        picture of who Dominick Tullo was.  He was a man
 8        who made decisions and there was nothing you could
 9        do about his decisions once he made them.
10             Whether it was his decision to move to Florida
11        after he retired over the objection of his wife,
12        whether it was his decision to keep smoking over
13        the objections of his wife, he didn't like to have
14        his decisions questioned.
15             We never heard in this case that he ever
16        second-guessed his decision to smoke.  And if he
17        didn't second-guess it, you shouldn't second-guess
18        it either.  It was his decision.
19             And I want to end on that decision point with
20        a clip you saw earlier in the trial.
21             May I see number 29, please.
22             (Video clip played as follows:)
23             VOICE:  If you smoke cigarettes, you increase
24        your chances of dying early.  In this kind of a 25        country, it comes down to you whether you like it 5225
 1        or not.  No one is going to forbid an adult to
 2        smoke, and it is now quite clear that no one is
 3        going to tell him it's good for him either.  The
 4        decision is his, the decision and the health that
 5        may depend on it.
 6             (Video clip concluded.)
 7             MR. GEISE:  Ladies and gentlemen, the decision
 8        was his.
 9             I thank you so much for your time and
10        attention this morning.  I thank you so much for
11        your patience the last three weeks, you've been a
12        terrific jury.


 7             MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Counsel.
 8             Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  You will
 9        be glad to hear that my remarks, I will try to keep
10        them around 15 minutes long.  It's been a pleasure
11        to be before you in Judge Sasser's court, and you
12        have all been exceptional jurors, so I just thank
13        you for that.
14             When this trial began I gave a brief opening
15        statement where I talked, I told you a little bit
16        about my client and I told you what the evidence
17        was going to show about Mr. Tullo.
18             Now we're at the end of trial and
19        Ms. Gallagher did an excellent job covering
20        yesterday why the lawyers in this case have failed
21        to meet their burden against the defendants on all
22        their claims.
23             Please remember, this case is not about
24        whether cigarette smoking caused Dominick Tullo's
25        cancer.  We know that it did.  That's not what 5182
 1        we're here to decide.
 2             We're also not here to resolve whether  3        cigarette smoking is addictive, we know that,
 4        nicotine is addictive.
 5             Instead, this case is about two things.  One,
 6        it's specifically about Mr. Tullo and the way he
 7        lived his life, smoking for 60 years; and two, it's
 8        about whether any of these tobacco companies did
 9        anything or said anything that influenced
10        Mr. Tullo's decisions or behavior.
11             And the evidence is clear in this case that
12        nothing any of the defendant companies did affected
13        Mr. Tullo's behavior.
14             Now, the evidence you heard during this trial
15        shows that Mr. Tullo started smoking some time way
16        back in the 1930s, obviously, that was a long time
17        ago, and it's not easy for anyone to remember
18        specific details going back that far.
19             But what did we learn?  Mrs. Tullo, along with
20        her daughter and her son, told us he smoked
21        at least seven different brands throughout his
22        life.  They may have added a couple vivid memories
23        about specific brands or others that they recall
24        him smoking for certain periods of time.  But what
25        didn't they tell us? 5183
 1             Ladies and gentlemen, please remember, you're  2        the investigators here and you're looking at the
 3        evidence in this case through a detective's eyes
 4        because, after all, you're trying to determine the
 5        truth based on the evidence.
 6             Among other things, your job is to figure out
 7        the who, what, where, when, how and why about the
 8        facts in this case.
 9             Now, I have to ask you what do we know about
10        my client's brands, what do we know about Liggett
11        cigarettes?
12             Well, the who and the what, that's pretty
13        easy.  The who is Dominick Tullo.  The what is
14        Chesterfield cigarettes, unfiltered cigarettes, by
15        the way.
16             The when and the where, that's also pretty
17        easy.  We know he's living back in New York City,
18        and it was the late 1940s, or so.  He recently got
19        married or got involved and then married with his
20        wife, Mrs. Tullo.
21             The how and the why, however, they didn't
22        exactly say that.  Sure, we know he switched
23        smoking the Chesterfields at some point before the
24        first smoking house studies came out linking
25        smoking to cancer.  But the details become kind of 5184  1        hazy about Chesterfield cigarettes.
 2             In other words, we don't know exactly why
 3        Dominick Tullo started smoking or switched to
 4        smoking Chesterfields in his mid-20s.  We also
 5        learned that he switched -- I'm sorry -- and it
 6        still remains vague about how much he actually
 7        smoked.
 8             Well, we know he switched to Chesterfield
 9        around the late 1940s.  We also learned he switched
10        to five different brands over the next decade or
11        so.  Truthfully, as we sit here today, we still
12        don't know much about his use of any of those
13        brands, and those brands including Chesterfield.
14             Please remember, plaintiffs counsel,
15        Mr. Hammer and Mr. Gdanski, they have the burden of
16        proof here, it's their job to prove their claims
17        against each defendant, and yet they never provided
18        details about Mr. Tullo and any of these brands.
19             Now, if the people working at Liggett asked me
20        today how long did Mr. Tullo smoke Chesterfield
21        cigarettes, I would have to say, honestly, I don't
22        know.  His wife told us something about how he
23        switched to smoking them some time around 65 years
24        ago, but she didn't really tell us much else.
25             You have to speculate to determine the amount 5185
 1        or length of time that he smoked Chesterfields.  In
 2        other words, you have to guess to solve the
 3        investigation.  You can't do that because this is a
 4        court of law.
 5             Your role is to determine the truth, and the
 6        evidence leads you to draw a giant question mark
 7        about why and how much Chesterfield cigarettes
 8        Mr. Tullo smoked among some of the other brands
 9        over half a century ago.
10             For that reason alone, plaintiffs have failed
11        to meet their burden.  But it doesn't stop there.
12             To find against Liggett in this case you have
13        to ask were Liggett cigarettes, were the
14        Chesterfields, the legal cause of Dominick Tullo's
15        death?  Did Chesterfield cigarettes substantially
16        cause or contribute to his lung cancer?
17             You've heard that before from some of the
18        other lawyers.  In other words, you have to ask
19        yourself, would Mr. Tullo have gotten lung cancer
20        if he had never touched Liggett cigarettes back
21        over 60 years ago?
22             And the answer to that question is, of course,
23        he smoked other -- Dominick Tullo smoked other
24        brands other than Chesterfield for a majority of
25        his life and he still would have gotten lung 5186
 1        cancer.  Because of that, Liggett cigarettes could
 2        not have been a legal cause of his death, but, of
 3        course, that very fact doesn't change that there
 4        was no evidence presented at trial proving that
 5        anything these cigarette companies did or said, and
 6        that's including Liggett, affected Mr. Tullo and
 7        his smoking decisions in any way.  These are some
 8        major problems with plaintiffs case.
 9             You'll recall yesterday, you heard some bits
10        and snippets about Dr. Burns and a few things he
11        said.  Dr. Burns said that each and every cigarette
12        Dominick Tullo smoked contributed to his lung
13        cancer.  I'm not sure if you recall that, because
14        it was a few days ago, that's an interesting choice
15        of words.  He said "contributed."
16             Aren't you just a little bit curious why he
17        didn't say more than that?  He didn't tell you what
18        does or how much or how many cigarettes is
19        sufficient to cause lung cancer.  Sure, he drew
20        some map out and did some sort of chain thing but
21        he simply said each one contributes.  What does
22        that mean?
23             Think of it this way.  Does each and every 24        bucket of water contribute to filling the lake?
25        Sure, each bucket may contribute, but when you take 5187
 1        a look at the whole lake, no single bucket can be
 2        considered a substantial contribution to filling
 3        that lake.
 4             And remember, in this case, you have to answer
 5        whether certain cigarettes substantially caused
 6        Dominick Tullo's lung cancer.  Sure, each cigarette
 7        may have contributed, but the evidence about
 8        Chesterfields, as well as some of the other brands,
 9        it is so vague it cannot be considered a
10        substantial contribution.
11             In fact, you heard their own expert, and I
12        think that Mr. Bideau just mentioned it,
13        Dr. Cummings told you that a person who smoked less
14        than -- had less than a ten-pack year smoking
15        history and then stopped would virtually eliminate
16        any risks to his health.
17             Based on the evidence, or the lack thereof,
18        Mr. Tullo's use of Liggett cigarettes was a
19        fraction of that time.  And common sense tells us
20        that's not enough to be a legal cause of his death.
21             Now, the other day you were read the testimony
22        of Mr. Morgan and you were played the videotape of 23        Dr. Farone.  Now, these two are really easy for me
24        to talk about.  Simply put, Mr. Morgan and
25        Dr. Farone didn't say anything about Liggett, 5188
 1        nothing.  Both worked for other companies.  It
 2        should be disregarded when it comes to my client,
 3        Liggett.  In fact, I still have no idea what
 4        Mr. Morgan or Dr. Farone had anything to do with
 5        Mr. Tullo.
 6             You also heard a lot of arguments in this case
 7        and testimony that used catch-all statements like
 8        the tobacco companies did this or the tobacco
 9        companies did that.
10             Well, there's a funny saying about
11        generalizations.  All generalizations, including
12        this one, are false.  In reality, generalizations
13        are unfair, they're inaccurate, they're not really
14        helpful at getting at the truth.
15             With respect to my client, Liggett, there is
16        some more straightforward path to the truth.  The
17        evidence shows that even going back to the '50s,
18        time and time again Liggett acted independently and
19        responsibly.
20             For example, when the first studies came out 21        linking smoking to lung cancer back in the early
22        1950s, what did Liggett do?  Well, you heard from
23        Dr. Burns and Dr. Cummings, they confirmed a few
24        things for us.
25             It's undisputed in this case, Liggett did not 5189
 1        attend this 1953 Plaza Hotel meeting, Liggett did
 2        not create or publish that Frank Statement to
 3        cigarette smokers.
 4             What did Liggett do?  Instead, it chose to
 5        launch its own large-scale effort into smoking
 6        health research.  This was confirmed by Dr. Burns
 7        and Dr. Cummings.  Then they went on and they
 8        shared all the results of the research with the
 9        Surgeon General's Advisory Committee.  That was in
10        1963.
11             Do you remember the letter I showed you?  I
12        wish I had some sort of overheads, but I don't.
13        But I showed you a letter last week from the
14        Surgeon General where it basically praised Liggett
15        and their consultant group, Arthur D. Little, with
16        respected effort and cooperation and eventual
17        contribution to the 1964 report.
18             And I think at one point you also heard
19        Dr. Cummings -- this is much more recently -- he 20        actually volunteered this on the stand about a
21        no-nicotine cigarette called Quest which he finds
22        is helping people quit smoking.  Well, that
23        cigarette is also marketed by an affiliate of
24        Liggett.
25             Ladies and gentlemen, those are the facts 5190
 1        about my client, Liggett.  As you know by now, like
 2        all trials, this is a case where we've search for
 3        the truth.  And I will tell you in this case, based
 4        on the evidence, there's only one truth when it
 5        comes to Dominick Tullo and his smoking.  And what
 6        we saw in this courtroom, that truth is no one
 7        knows the truth.
 8             As we sit here today, we still don't know
 9        anything about why Mr. Tullo switched to any given
10        brand and we have to speculate about how much or
11        how little he smoked of each of the brands they
12        talked about.
13             Certainly, apart from making cigarettes, which
14        is perfectly legal, perfectly legal in this
15        country, there's no evidence showing that any of
16        these defendants had any effect or influence on his
17        lifestyle or decisions. 18             Instead, what we do know about Mr. Tullo is he
19        was a hard working man who lived a good life, he
20        raised a great family and he did what he wanted to
21        do.  And those are the facts.  And those simple
22        facts show that Dominick Tullo made his own
23        decisions and followed his own path through life.
24             Pure and simple, Abraham Lincoln once said:
25        You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by 5191
 1        evading it today.  That statement is as true today
 2        as it was 150 years ago.
 3             Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you, please, use
 4        your intelligence and your common sense and retrace
 5        the evidence.  And when you do that, you will find
 6        by the greater weight of the evidence there's no
 7        support for their claim for money against Liggett
 8        and the other defendants in this case.
 9             Thank you once more for your kind attention to
10        my closing remarks and have a great day.  Thank
11        you.
