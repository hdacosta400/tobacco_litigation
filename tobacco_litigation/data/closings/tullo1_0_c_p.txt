 1             MR. HAMMER:  Thank you, Judge.
 2             This case is about Dominick, it's about Mary.
 3        This case is important to Mary Tullo.  It's 4        important because this is her opportunity, her day
 5        in court.  You know, counsel for Philip Morris
 6        talked about litigation world and real world.  This
 7        is the real world.  This is the real world.
 8             The real world is where Dominick Tullo smoked
 9        cigarettes for 60 years of his life and died an
10        agonizing death and this woman watched him; watched
11        him, the man she loved, deteriorate before her
12        eyes.  That's what the real world is all about.
13             Litigation.  Do you want to talk about
14        litigation and who was planning litigation?
15        Philip Morris was planning litigation, in their
16        documents.  When they talked about if a prosecuting
17        attorney were to take a case against us, we can no
18        longer argue free choice when our product is
19        addictive.  That's the real world, and that's the
20        litigation world that Philip Morris created.  They
21        created it.  They created this litigation world.
22        Don't be fooled by that.
23             And do you want to talk about litigation?
24        Findings.  The Engle court, the Florida Supreme
25        Court issued findings. 5241
 1             Can you turn this on, please. 2             This is the instruction you're getting:  If
 3        you find that Dominick Tullo was addicted to
 4        cigarettes containing nicotine, and if such
 5        addiction was the legal cause of his death, certain
 6        findings from a prior trial -- a trial that these
 7        defendants were a part of, the Engle trial -- where
 8        finding were made -- findings from a prior trial
 9        will be binding on you.  That's what we're here
10        for.
11             The litigation world, they created it and now
12        they want to stand up here and say, oh, there's a
13        real world and a litigation world.  No.
14             The real world is they killed Dominick Tullo,
15        and because of that Mary's suffering, that's what
16        we got here, that's the real world.
17             You know, in opening plaintiffs -- defense
18        counsel said this case, it's about control,
19        causation and responsibility.  And yet not one of
20        them talked about that.  Did they?
21             Do you know what it's about?  It's about
22        control.  It's about control, it's about who
23        controlled the nicotine in cigarettes, who
24        manipulated the nicotine in cigarettes.  The
25        tobacco companies. 5242 1             Why did they do that?  So they could get their
 2        smokers addicted and keep them addicted, the
 3        tobacco companies.
 4             MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Objection, Your Honor.
 5             THE COURT:  Sidebar.
 6             (Sidebar held as follows:)
 7             MR. ROSENSTEIN:  There's essentially no
 8        evidence in this case that my client controlled and
 9        manipulated the nicotine levels to hurt smokers,
10        and that was the findings from the Engle Supreme
11        Court.
12             THE COURT:  Yeah, we're getting --
13             MR. ROSENSTEIN:  It's getting into some
14        areas --
15             THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain because it
16        concerned the defendant, it doesn't for Liggett.
17             MR. HAMMER:  I will address it.
18             THE COURT:  Sustained.
19             (Sidebar concluded and the following
20        proceedings were held in open court:)
21             MR. HAMMER:  You heard from Philip Morris' own
22        scientist, Dr. Farone, that Philip Morris, they
23        were working on projects to manipulate the nicotine
24        in cigarettes, by adding urea, adding ammonia,
25        those aren't products that naturally occur.  They  5243
 1        do that to enhance the nicotine, to addict their
 2        smokers.
 3             Do you want to talk about control?  That's
 4        where control is.  Do you want to talk about
 5        causation, cause that's what they put up here,
 6        that's what this case is about.  They've all
 7        admitted, they've all admitted that their
 8        cigarettes were the medical cause of Dominick
 9        Tullo's death.
10             They admit that their cigarettes caused his
11        cancer and death.  They've admitted that.  None of
12        them have gotten up here and said that, but they've
13        have admitted it.  That's not an issue in this
14        case.  We didn't bring you any medical doctors to
15        show you that.
16             Do you want to talk about responsibilities?
17        That's what they talk about in openings, this case
18        is about responsibility.  Really?
19             How about the responsibility that they said
20        they would undertake, the responsibility that we
21        accept an interest in people's health as a basic
22        responsibility paramount to every other
23        consideration in our business.  Really?
24             That was The Frank Statement.  And do you know
25        what, if The Frank Statement was published in 1954,  5244
 1        and this is what it said, that would have been very
 2        responsible.
 3             MR. BIDEAU:  Objection, Your Honor.
 4             (Sidebar held as follows:)
 5             MR. BIDEAU:  He's got on the board up there,
 6        it doesn't say Philip Morris mandated, it says
 7        tobacco defendants, tobacco companies.
 8             THE COURT:  The defendants, you have the same
 9        objection, don't use that slide.
10             MR. HAMMER:  I just explained, I'm not going
11        to use the slide.
12             MR. BIDEAU:  It's sitting up there now.
13             THE COURT:  Objection sustained.  Objection
14        sustained.
15             (Sidebar concluded and the following was held
16        in open court:)
17             MR. HAMMER:  The Frank statement, we all saw
18        it.  What did it say?  It said we accept an
19        interest in people's health as a basic
20        responsibility paramount to every other
21        consideration in our business.  And if that was the
22        truth, they could have had that right here and
23        then, it could have said quit, smokers quit until
24        our scientists develop a safer cigarette.  That 25        would have been a Frank Statement. 5245
 1             That would have been a Frank Statement and
 2        that would have been a responsible thing that the
 3        tobacco companies should have done.
 4             And do you know what, that would have
 5        continued the tobacco sales to drop like they were
 6        doing because of those scientific studies that were
 7        out there.  And because it was dropping because
 8        smokers were quit because they were learning about
 9        the dangers of tobacco.  And the link to cancer.
10             But then when they came out there with The
11        Frank Statement, it reassured smokers, listen,
12        smokers, don't worry about it, we've got our
13        scientists working on it, we're going to find a
14        safe cigarette; and if it's bad for you, don't
15        worry, we will take it out.
16             They said that time and time and time again.
17        And that influenced every smoker in America.  And
18        it influenced Dominick Tullo because, do you know
19        what, if the tobacco companies said this to
20        Dominick Tullo in 1954, he would have quit.  He
21        would have quit.
22             If they said this on the TV in 1964 -- do you 23        remember you saw the clip yesterday with the
24        tobacco executives sitting there smoking a
25        cigarette responding to the Surgeon General report? 5246
 1             If he would have said, do you know, Surgeon
 2        General report came out, we accept the
 3        responsibility in our customer's health, and I want
 4        to tell the American public we're working on a
 5        safer cigarette but we don't have it now, and so
 6        you should quit now, or working on quitting, and we
 7        will help you quit if you need help, but until then
 8        we're going to stop selling our cigarettes until we
 9        find a safe cigarette that won't kill you.
10             Now, if that's what he did on TV, if the
11        tobacco executives would have done that on TV in
12        1964 after the Surgeon General, what do you think
13        would have happened to cigarette smokers?  They
14        would have quit.
15             And what would Dominick Tullo have done?  He
16        would have quit.  Because we know from the evidence
17        that he discussed the Surgeon General report, he
18        discussed the findings of the Surgeon General
19        report.
20             And if Mary would have said, Dominick, the
21        tobacco executive even got on TV last night and 22        said, hey, quit smoking, they're going to stop
23        making cigarettes until they find a safe cigarette,
24        what do you think would have happened?  He would
25        have quit.  But they didn't do that.  Why?  Because 5247
 1        of money.  Because that's what this case is about.
 2             And they want to tell you, oh, it's about
 3        money and Mary's seeking money.  Mary's seeking
 4        money because that's all she can seek.  She can't
 5        seek getting Dominick back.  She can't do it.  And
 6        if she could, she would be happy to walk right out
 7        of here hand-in-hand with him, but she can't do
 8        that.
 9             And, you know, we don't know how long Dominick
10        would have lived after 74, after 74 years.  But by
11        the tobacco companies standards, hey, he lived the
12        good life, that's good enough, 74, you're dead,
13        that's good.  Really?
14             Mary's 87 years old.  87 years old.  She lived
15        13 years past 74; 13 years that she could have been
16        with Dominick, but we don't know how long Dominick
17        would have lived.
18             You know people today, they're living until
19        100.  And Dominick was a man who was healthy 20        everyday of his life.  Never went to the doctor.
21        But they want to come in here and tell you 74,
22        that's good enough, he had a long enough life.
23        Really?
24             These are undisputed facts in the case.  The
25        Judge read to you that I said yesterday it was 5248
 1        stipulated, no.  They're undisputed.  I used the
 2        wrong word.  They're undisputed, they're agreed
 3        upon; that cigarettes are addictive, cigarettes
 4        cause lung cancer, Dominick died from lung cancer
 5        medically caused by cigarettes, and that
 6        Philip Morris, Philip Morris admits that their
 7        cigarettes were a medical cause of Dominick's
 8        death.
 9             Now, you know, these other companies, they got
10        up here and they said, well, wait a minute, it
11        wasn't our cigarettes because he only smoked for
12        three years, he only smoked for five years, he only
13        smoked for a few years.  And Dr. Cummings, he said
14        you got to smoke ten years for it to affect you.
15        Really?
16             Well, guess what, when you smoke one
17        cigarette, two cigarettes, three cigarettes, you
18        need to keep smoking those cigarettes, so it's to 19        bathe your lungs in the poison that they make.
20        They make it.  They put it out there on the market.
21             And they've already been found to be
22        negligent, they've already been found that their
23        cigarettes are defective.  Those are findings in
24        this courtroom.  They're findings.
25             They've already found -- been found to conceal 5249
 1        information.  And let me ask you something, how do
 2        you, as a smoker, as Dominick Tullo, how do you
 3        rely on something that's concealed from you?
 4             Well, you got to think about this.  Because
 5        you got to say to yourself, well, if it wasn't
 6        concealed, would Dominick have behaved differently?
 7             And if this was told to Dominick and the rest
 8        of the world, if this was told to Dominick in 1954,
 9        instead of telling him we accept the responsibility
10        and we're going to find -- we're going to work on
11        it and cigarettes aren't injurious to your health,
12        if they would have said this, people would have
13        quit, including Dominick.
14             And we all know that.  That's the concealment.
15        That's when the concealment started.  That's when
16        it started.  And Liggett, they may not have signed 17        that document, but they became a part of the
18        tobacco industry in 1958.
19             And do you know what, that was a front, their
20        own documents say it, it was a front for research,
21        so that they could put their word out there and
22        contest everything that was out there in the
23        public.
24             Come on, this is the real world we're living
25        in.  And the real world tells you that a company 5250
 1        that's responsible behaves responsibly.  And to use
 2        the quote that was used by counsel where he said
 3        Abraham Lincoln said you cannot escape the
 4        responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.
 5             Well, guess what, folks, they evaded it back
 6        in 1954 when they said they would take
 7        responsibility, don't let them evade it today.
 8        Because that's what this case is about.  They took
 9        on the responsibility of their smokers, including
10        Dominick Tullo, and they cast that aside for
11        dollars, for the almighty dollar, that's what this
12        case is about.
13             And they talked about, oh, well, legal cause.
14        Really?  Let's talk about legal cause, because
15        defense counsel was very careful in showing you the 16        legal cause instruction.  But the legal cause
17        instruction has two paragraphs to it.  And the two
18        paragraphs talk about legal cause and contributing
19        cause.  They left that part out.
20             Conveniently -- it's in here somewhere -- can
21        I have the Elmo?
22             This is the full instruction.  Conveniently
23        they read the first part to you.  They never talked
24        about the second part.  The first part does require
25        that but for the addiction to cigarettes containing 5251
 1        nicotine, the injury would not have occurred.
 2             But do you know what, there's a second
 3        paragraph.  The second paragraph said:  In order to
 4        be regarded as the legal cause of death addiction
 5        need not be the only cause.  It was very convenient
 6        when defense counsel got up here and said, oh,
 7        well, but for the addiction then, you know, too bad
 8        because, do you know what, he chose to smoke.
 9             But there's a legal definition, and you've got
10        it sitting right there in the laps, and I beg you
11        to look at it because that part of the definition
12        says addiction need not be the only cause.
13             Addiction may be a legal cause of death even 14        though it operated in combination, in combination,
15        with his choices, in combination with his
16        decisions, that's legal cause.
17             So we have testimony from the doctors who told
18        you that his addiction led to him smoking that many
19        cigarettes.  Did his choices do that, too?  Sure,
20        and that's why we've accepted partial blame.
21             Did Dominick Tullo's addiction along with his
22        choice cause his lung cancer?  Sure.
23             Are the two mutually exclusive?  No.  They're
24        all part of the same process.  He made a choice
25        every time he didn't quit, but neither of those 5252
 1        choices were free choices that he was able to make
 2        without having to suffer the consequences of his
 3        addiction.  They work hand-in-hand.
 4             Sure, you have choices, everybody does.  The
 5        heroin addict has a choice every time he puts the
 6        needle into his arm, but he's still addicted.  The
 7        alcoholic has a choice every time he puts that
 8        bottle to his lips, but he's still addicted.
 9             And the smoker who was an addicted smoker, who
10        smokes for 60 years day in and day out, has a
11        choice, everyday he lights -- opens up that
12        cigarette pack, pulls it out, puts it up to his 13        lips and strikes the match or hits a lighter,
14        that's the choice he makes.
15             But do you know what, it's driven by his
16        addiction.  And in combination with his addiction
17        and his choices that is the legal cause in this
18        case.  Don't be fooled by just that one paragraph.
19        Both paragraphs apply.  And the reason they apply
20        is because that's what happened in this case.
21             The Judge is giving them instructions, that's
22        a legal instruction, because if the evidence in
23        this case didn't support that instruction, that
24        part wouldn't be given to you.  The part wouldn't
25        be given to you.  That's why it's given to you, to 5253
 1        give you guidance, use that second paragraph
 2        because that's what's applicable with legal cause.
 3        Don't be fooled.
 4             You know, they talked about litigation world
 5        and the real world.  In Philip Morris' world, it's
 6        a world in which cigarettes aren't cancer-causing,
 7        'cause they told the world that for 50 years.
 8             In Philip Morris' world, it's a world in which
 9        taking responsibility and cooperating are
10        synonymous with creating doubt and misleading 11        people.  Because that's what they told the world in
12        1953, and that's what they told Dominick.  We take
13        on a responsibility.
14             But for the next 50 years they mislead the
15        American public and Dominick, they created doubt
16        for the next 50 years about what their product
17        really did.
18             In Philip Morris' world, the litigation world,
19        the real world, Philip Morris' world, they talk
20        about the illusion of filtration, which is as
21        important as the fact of filtration.  Really?
22             That's the real world, that's their world.
23        That's the world we all live in, and that's the
24        world we all lived in in the '50s and '60s and '70s
25        and 80's and '90s when Dominick Tullo was smoking 5254
 1        their products.  That's the world.
 2             And yet they come in here and try to make a
 3        game of it talking about litigation and the real
 4        world, their world as it existed in the '50s, '60s,
 5        '70s and 80's, a corporation where -- a business
 6        where corporations worked together to deceive the
 7        American public.
 8             That's their world.  That's the
 9        tobacco industry's world.  A world in which 10        corporate profits are more important than an
11        individual's life.  Their profits were more
12        important than their customers' lives.  That's the
13        real world, and that was the world that these
14        tobacco companies lived in.
15             Think about that.  A world in which it's
16        acceptable to deceive the scientists who are
17        researching what lung cancer does and the
18        addictiveness; a world where they supply
19        misinformation to the world so that they can
20        continue to sell their products, and they have
21        already been found to have deceived, they have
22        already been found to have agreed to deceive the
23        public.
24             There's already a finding.  There's no
25        question about it, it's already been found by 5255
 1        another court, and it's binding in this case when
 2        you determine that Dominick is a member of that
 3        class.
 4             And he is.  He smoked for 60 years, he was
 5        addicted and his addiction, in combination with
 6        other things, were the legal cause of his death.
 7        There's no question about that. 8             It's a world in which a 71-year-old woman at
 9        the time who hates cigarettes, who's constantly
10        telling her husband throughout the history of his
11        smoking; it's a world where they come in and say
12        today in this courtroom that she's been deceitful
13        to you, that's what they're doing; they are
14        challenging what Mary says to you because she
15        doesn't have a clear memory of exactly when he
16        smoked and how much he smoked, folks, she's 87
17        years old.
18             A man in which -- a world in which a man could
19        smoke a cigarette brand, Parliament, Philip Morris'
20        Parliament cigarette, with this unique filter that
21        I showed you yesterday, for 30 years, but it has
22        nothing to do with the unique filter, and yet, look
23        at this document, the document that -- the document
24        that was sent to him by Philip Morris that he
25        filled out with regard to Parliament cigarettes, 5256
 1        asks, why do you smoke Parliament?
 2             And there's a little box that he checks off.
 3        And the options -- there's three options, four
 4        options, actually.  And he says -- it's hard to
 5        read -- what makes Parliament Lights unique?
 6             It's a light refreshing taste, the special 7        offers, the recessed filter?  What's checked off?
 8        All of the above.
 9             This wasn't done for litigation, as they want
10        you to believe, the litigation world.  This was
11        done, as they said, evidence by Dominick himself.
12             THE CLERK:  Counselor, five minutes.
13             MR. HAMMER:  Thank you.  You know, this case
14        is about the fact that each one of these cigarettes
15        killed Dominick Tullo.
16             And they talked about, well, if you pour one
17        bucket into a lake, is that going to make a
18        difference?  Well, do you know what, maybe not one
19        bucket.  But do you know what, it takes all of
20        those buckets to fill up the lake.  It takes all
21        those buckets to fill up the lake.
22             And do you know what, if -- if companies get
23        together and they get together to deceive the
24        world, they should be held responsible.  They
25        created a psychological crutch for their smokers 5257
 1        and for Dominick.  That's in their documents.
 2             Do you know, this case by their actions is not
 3        only negligent, it's grossly negligent.  For a
 4        corporation, these four corporations to behave the 5        way they did, to get together and deceive the
 6        American public, have their executives stand up
 7        there and swear to tell the truth and lie for their
 8        executives to get up on TV and say if there's
 9        something bad about our product we'll go out of
10        business, if there's something bad about our
11        product we'll take it out, that is reckless
12        conduct, they don't care about the individuals and
13        they kill people.
14             And that's reprehensible, that's reprehensible
15        conduct, and they should be punished.  And that's
16        why punitive damages should be awarded in this
17        case.  And punitive damages, folks, check off the
18        box for entitlement, and then we come back for a
19        day and you decide how much.  That's your decision.
20             You know, I wish I had a lot more time to talk
21        to you, but I don't.  But I don't think there's any
22        question that Dominick was addicted to cigarettes.
23             And never one time in his life did any of
24        these companies, any of them, tell the truth to
25        Dominick Tullo about the addictive nature of their 5258
 1        product or about how much -- how it would kill him.
 2             And you need to compare the acts of the two.
 3        Dominick's acts of smoking, because he was 4        addicted; and their actions, which are really
 5        reprehensible, they really are.
 6             And the most important thing is, you know,
 7        when you talk about the truth, trial is a search
 8        for the truth, the truth is that they deceived
 9        Dominick.
10             And if they told him the truth in 1954, and
11        the rest of the American public, it would have
12        changed things.  Because if they said until our
13        scientists develop a safe cigarette, stop smoking,
14        because we care about you, we accept the
15        responsibility in the health of our customers,
16        we're a responsible corporation.  They didn't do
17        that.  And they have to pay for that.  That's
18        what's fair.
19             Don't send Mary home alone tonight, let her go
20        home tonight and say, do you know what, Dominick,
21        we got them, finally, the jury did the right thing.
22        Send her home proud.
23             You should be proud in your verdict.  You
24        should be able to look back in a year, five years,
25        ten years and be proud of what you did in this 5259
 1        courtroom for the past two-and-a-half weeks because 2        what you're doing is important.
 3             What they did was reprehensible.  And don't
 4        let them fool you and minimize what they did,
 5        because they did it to Dominick Tullo, they did it
 6        to Mary.  Don't let them fool you, it's not right.
 7             That's why, that's why your verdict should
 8        speak loud and speak proud, and you should go home
 9        tonight feeling proud about your verdict, because
10        that's the right thing, that's the just thing,
11        that's the truth thing in this case.
12             You know, it's been said that "the arc of the
13        moral universe is long, but it bends towards
14        justice," Martin Luther King said that.  And it
15        really applies in this case because that arc
16        started way back in 1954, and it just kept going.
17        It's a long arc.  It's a long arc of deceit, a long
18        arc of lies.
19             THE CLERK:  Time's up.
20             THE COURT:  Mr. Hammer.
21             MR. HAMMER:  But it bends towards justice.
22        And it bends towards justice in this courtroom.
23        And that's what we're seeking in this courtroom,
24        justice, justice for Mary for her loss.
25             And the only way to do that is to say tobacco 5260 1        companies, the lies you created in 1954 and
 2        perpetrated upon this country and Dominick Tullo
 3        for the next 50 years, that was wrong.  Do Mary
 4        right.  Do her proud.
 5             THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Hammer.
 6             MR. HAMMER:  Thank you.
