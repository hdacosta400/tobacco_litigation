15              MR. HOHNBAUM:  Thank you, Your Honor.
16              May it please the Court, counsel,
17        Ms. Turner.
18              Good morning.
19              JURORS:  Good morning.
20              MR. HOHNBAUM:  You have a copy of the
21        instructions in this case.  What we ask is that
22        before you begin your deliberations in this
23        phase, that you read those instructions and
24        that those instructions be your guide, along
25        with your common sense, about how you should decide the issues in this phase of the trial.
2              And if you look at those instructions and
3        you examine the legal principles in those
4        instructions, you will see that layer after
5        layer of those instructions actually create a
6        funnel, a funnel for your consideration, and
7        that what you just heard -- and we're going to
8        go through this -- what you just heard, a lot
9        of that should not, we submit, be part of your
10        consideration.
11              You heard a lot about R.J. Reynolds
12        continuing to sell cigarettes and making and
13        marketing other products that are legal.  And
14        we take you back to day one, where each of you
15        said the fact that R.J. Reynolds sells
16        cigarettes, knowing that they harm people, is
17        not something that would get in the way of you
18        making a decision about the issues in this
19        case.
20              The issues in this case are not about
21        R.J. Reynolds making a product that is legal,
22        and your instructions make that very clear.
23              The instructions also make it clear to
24        you that it's up to you -- up to you -- whether
25        or not to award punitive damages against R.J. Reynolds.
2              Mr. Rosen suggested that you have already
3        decided in your mind that punitive damages
4        should be awarded in this case, but what the
5        instructions tell you is that, based on the
6        evidence that you heard in Phase II, the
7        evidence from Dr. Figlar, the evidence from
8        Dr. Raffa, and the information that you were
9        provided in this phase of the trial, may, in
10        your minds, come to the conclusion that
11        punitive damages are, in fact, not warranted in
12        this case.
13              And I want to take time in my argument to
14        you this morning to contrast what the world was
15        like and what R.J. Reynolds was like 40 years
16        ago, which you heard about in Phase I of the
17        case, and what R.J. Reynolds is like today;
18        because if you decide to impose punitive
19        damages, you are imposing punitive damages on
20        R.J. Reynolds today.
21              Can you turn the ELMO on, please?
22              And I want to focus at the outset on the
23        instruction on Page 3 of your instructions.  It
24        says:  In determining the amount of punitive
25        damages, if any, to assess against R.J. Reynolds, you may consider the extent to
2        which Reynolds' conduct has changed -- the
3        extent to which R.J. Reynolds' conduct has
4        changed from the conduct on which you based
5        your determination that punitive damages may be
6        warranted, and the extent to which
7        circumstances have changed -- the extent to
8        which circumstances have changed -- and you may
9        consider whether the misconduct that occurred
10        in the distant past and involved actors who are
11        no longer associated with R.J. Reynolds need
12        not be punished, need not be punished, and that
13        it should be -- or that it should be punished
14        less severely than recent misconduct.  That's
15        the law that the Judge has instructed you on.
16        And you --
17              And as the law the Judge instructed you
18        on also says, you cannot consider the Engle
19        findings in making your decision with respect
20        to punitive damages.  And that's why those
21        instructions continue to funnel your inquiry to
22        a much more narrow point.
23              And when you follow those instructions
24        and you look at those instructions, you will
25        see that a punitive damages award anywhere near the excessive amount Mr. Rosen suggested to you
2        is simply not warranted under the facts of this
3        case.
4              So who is R.J. Reynolds in 2016?  Who is
5        R.J. Reynolds?
6              And, again, the instruction says you
7        should consider whether Reynolds has changed
8        from the company that it was, that you heard
9        about in Phase I in this case.
10              R.J. Reynolds does not conceal -- I'm
11        going to go through this information and show
12        you how R.J. Reynolds has changed -- does not
13        conceal that cigarettes are dangerous and
14        addictive in 2016.
15              It makes, sells and advertises -- and
16        we're going to talk about these reduced-risk
17        products -- and informs smokers there are
18        options.  There are options to smoking
19        cigarettes that you can consider, including --
20        and it's on the website, and we'll look at
21        it -- quitting, if you're concerned about your
22        health.
23              The tobacco industry -- I'm going to talk
24        about this, too -- is today, and for the last
25        six or seven years, has been controlled by the Food and Drug Administration.
2              And, of course, R.J. Reynolds makes
3        nicotine-replacement products to help smokers
4        quit, and informs them that those are options
5        for them.
6              Considering the changed circumstances,
7        considering how the world has changed and how
8        R.J. Reynolds has changed, you do have the
9        discretion here not to award punitive damages.
10              And let me make something very clear --
11        and it's clear from the instructions -- that a
12        punitive damages award in this case can only be
13        awarded to Mrs. Turner and Mr. Wilkinson.  They
14        aren't awarded to charities, smoking-cessation
15        clinics --
16              MR. ROSEN:  Your Honor, I'm going to
17        object.
18              THE COURT:  Overruled.
19              MR. HOHNBAUM:  -- other public health
20        organizations.
21              At the end of the day, when it comes
22        right down to it, this phase of the trial is
23        really a request by Mrs. Wilkinson --
24        Mrs. Turner and Mr. Wilkinson to award them
25        more money. By your compensatory award, by your
2        verdict in the first phase, you have already
3        fully compensated -- that's what you were
4        doing -- you have already fully compensated
5        Mrs. -- Mr. Wilkinson and Mrs. Turner for the
6        conduct that caused Mrs. Wilkinson's death.
7              That $2.4 million, you have said that is
8        fully compensating them.  Any punitive award
9        would, of course, be in addition to that, and
10        also go to them and only to them.
11              And this is also in the instructions and
12        it's an important point:  That you should not
13        award punitive damages -- and read the
14        instructions -- if you conclude that the
15        purpose of punishment and deterrence will be
16        satisfied by your award of compensatory
17        damages.
18              If you say, look, $2.4 million, that
19        does, in fact, deter and punish, it is a
20        significant amount of money, if you think about
21        that, it's 1.2 million dollars to each of them.
22        That's a hundred -- a hundred thousand dollars
23        every year for 12 years.  That is a significant
24        sum of money.  And you can determine that that
25        is, in fact, sufficient. And, of course, this is, again, a funnel
2        of these instructions, that punitive damages,
3        if any, must be based solely on the harm
4        suffered by Mrs. Wilkinson.  You may not punish
5        R.J. Reynolds for harm to others.
6              And this, again, on Page 2 of the
7        instructions, so critically important, as they
8        were in Phase I.
9              And we know by the time and attention you
10        paid to this case, and the time and attention
11        you took in your deliberations, that you have,
12        in fact, gone through those instructions in
13        Phase I, and we ask you again to do that
14        carefully in this phase of the trial, as well.
15              And you will see that Reynolds can't be
16        punished for concealing or agreeing to conceal
17        information, can only be punished for conduct
18        that caused Mrs. Wilkinson's death, not harm to
19        other smokers, not for any strict liability for
20        any defect in the cigarette, not for
21        negligence, and not for the manufacturing and
22        marketing of other filtered or light cigarettes
23        by some other manufacturer.
24              Reynolds can't be punished for engaging
25        in lawful activity.  The manufacture, the sale, the advertisement of cigarettes is, in fact,
2        legal in this country.  Dr. Cummings told you
3        that, Dr. Figlar told you that.  It's legal to
4        sell cigarettes.
5              The warnings on the cigarettes, you've
6        got instructions about the warnings.  Reynolds
7        has no obligation to place any additional
8        warnings, and those warnings are adequate as a
9        matter of law.  As a matter of law, they're
10        adequate.
11              Every pack of cigarettes that
12        Mrs. Wilkinson smoked had a warning on the
13        label.  So, as you get back in the jury room,
14        after you've read the instructions, the
15        question is, should Reynolds be published --
16        punished today, in 2016?
17              And this is the instruction I read you:
18        You should consider what has changed, what has
19        changed since then.
20              Well, what's changed?  Well, we know that
21        R.J. Reynolds does not conceal anything today.
22        We know that there's no agreement to conceal.
23              What else do we know?  We know that the
24        people that you saw and heard about in Phase I
25        of this trial are gone.  Jim Johnston is gone, Ed Horrigan is gone, Claude Teague is gone.
2        Change.  Change, change, change.  The past is,
3        in fact, gone.  There are new owners, new
4        executives, new scientists.
5              It is, in fact, a changed company.  Still
6        selling cigarettes, a legal product in this
7        country, but changed from the conduct that you
8        saw in Phase I of this case.
9              And if you think about what evidence was
10        presented to you by the plaintiff in this case
11        in Phase I [sic], they called Dr. Raffa, the
12        economist.  They didn't call a witness in this
13        phase of the case to dispute the information
14        that I'm telling you right now, that Reynolds
15        has, in fact, changed, that they are a new
16        company.
17              They had the opportunity to put a witness
18        up on the stand and tell you that that is, in
19        fact, not true; and the fact of the matter is,
20        they didn't do that.  And that's because
21        R.J. Reynolds is a changed company.
22              Are punitive damages necessary to prevent
23        R.J. Reynolds from concealing information in
24        2016?  Is it necessary to do that?
25              And think about that for a second.  It's not necessary, because R.J. Reynolds informs --
2        informs smokers and the public today.
3              I want to talk about Reynolds' website, I
4        want to talk about the reduced-risk products
5        that Mr. Rosen mentioned, and I want to talk
6        about cessation products.
7              We know -- and we looked at the website
8        and we're going to talk about that -- Reynolds
9        informs the public today.  It's not like it
10        was.  Circumstances have changed.  The company
11        has changed.
12              We don't know what troubled you the most
13        because we weren't in the jury room; but,
14        today, all additives in cigarettes are on the
15        website.  They're on the website.
16              If anybody has a concern about a
17        particular ingredient in a product -- and you
18        can go brand by brand and figure out exactly
19        what is in your cigarette.
20              And Reynolds does inform people that
21        there are options.  One option, of course, is
22        to quit.  And we tell -- Reynolds tells smokers
23        that on the website.  And, of course, we're
24        going to talk about that.
25              Reynolds tells the FDA all of this information, the formula for Coke, the
2        formula -- that's what they're giving.  It's
3        not just the ingredients to the FDA; they're
4        telling the FDA in what amount they have those
5        ingredients for each brand of cigarettes.
6              Let's look at the website.  This is what
7        R.J. Reynolds tells people today:  Cigarette
8        smoking is a leading cause of preventable
9        deaths in the United States.  Cigarette smoking
10        significantly increases the risk of developing
11        lung cancer, heart disease, chronic bronchitis,
12        emphysema, and other serious diseases and
13        adverse health consequences [sic].
14              Reynolds informs smokers about that.
15        Quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk
16        for serious disease.
17              Here's the ingredient list on the
18        website.  Every single ingredient.
19              And let's talk a little bit about
20        Mr. Rosen's commentary on Dr. Figlar's
21        testimony about inhalability, the inhalability
22        of cigarettes.
23              Well, as you heard in Phase I, cigarettes
24        have been inhalable since the 1800s.  Since the
25        1800s.  And, folks, the FDA has all of this information.  It has all of the additives.
2              And did Mr. Rosen ask Dr. Figlar whether
3        or not they have requested that any of those
4        additives be taken out?  He did not, because
5        they haven't.  They have the power to do
6        exactly that, and they haven't done it.
7              And, of course, there's no evidence that
8        any of the additives that were mentioned in
9        those slides were actually in the cigarettes
10        that caused Mrs. Wilkinson harm.  And, again,
11        the funneling is, it has to be conduct that
12        caused her COPD/emphysema and death.
13              This phase of the trial is not a
14        referendum on whether cigarettes should be
15        legal.  They are legal.  And you can't base
16        your punitive damages award on that fact.
17              So let's talk about reduced-risk
18        products.
19              And I want to make something very clear
20        at the outset of this.  Mr. Rosen attempts to
21        make a distinction between R.J. Reynolds and
22        the sister companies.  He has the slide up
23        there with R.J. Reynolds on one side and the
24        sister companies on the other.
25              But Dr. Figlar told you that the research and development arm that assists those sister
2        companies is housed in R.J. Reynolds.
3        R.J. Reynolds has --
4              It's their employees, it's their
5        resources, it's their finances, it's their
6        commitment that R.J. Reynolds has; and it uses
7        those resources, those people, hundreds of
8        people, to assist those other companies in
9        making those products.
10              So the notion that there's some
11        separateness to that, well, true, they're --
12        they're structured separately, but the
13        resources from R.J. Reynolds goes dramatically
14        to help make those products.
15              And, of course, we know this from
16        Dr. Cummings and Dr. Figlar:  The only truly
17        safe cigarette is one that you do not smoke.
18        And we tell --
19              R.J. Reynolds tells the world that.  It
20        tells the world that no tobacco product has
21        been shown to be safe and without risks.  Not
22        just cigarettes, but any tobacco product.
23              There's no suggestion that those products
24        that are down the continuum of risk, that those
25        products are risk-free.  It's just that they have less risk.
2              The best course of action if you're
3        concerned about your health is to quit, but
4        those adults who make an informed decision
5        about whether or not they still want to use
6        tobacco products can consider the reduction of
7        risk associated with using other products that
8        R.J. Reynolds makes and provides resources to
9        those who make them.
10              And you heard about this.  Reynolds has
11        tried to make, for decades, a less hazardous
12        cigarette.  We talked about Premier -- we're
13        going to talk about that again -- Eclipse;
14        decades spent trying to make a safer cigarette.
15              And Dr. Figlar said Reynolds employees
16        work -- that's what they're doing.  They're in
17        the lab, they're providing financial resources,
18        human capital effort to help make safer
19        products.
20              Of course, R.J. Reynolds sells
21        cigarettes.  Adults make the decision today
22        whether or not they want to smoke cigarettes.
23        We make a legal product.
24              There are other products that we're
25        offering that actually provide less risk. That's what Dr. Figlar was talking about.  Less
2        risk product, options for informed adults.
3              A billion dollars, over a billion dollars
4        spent trying to market Premier and Eclipse.
5        And why?  Reynolds was trying to make a
6        less-hazardous product.
7              The goal of both Premier and Eclipse --
8        there was no confusion about this between
9        Dr. Cummings and Dr. Figlar -- the goal was to
10        reduce the carcinogens contained in tobacco
11        smoke.  No one forced R.J. Reynolds to do that.
12        They did it voluntarily.
13              Premier, first effort, I showed you that
14        monograph, 700 pages long.  They were
15        successful in making it less harmful.  They
16        weren't successful in making it appealing from
17        a taste standpoint to customers.  But they did
18        not give up.  And making Premier --
19              Dr. Cummings said this:  It was a
20        responsible thing to do.  Investing a billion
21        dollars in making a less-hazardous cigarette
22        was, in fact, a responsible thing to do.
23              Again, they didn't give up.  What did
24        they do after Premier?  They doubled up their
25        efforts and they made Eclipse.  And Eclipse is commercially available today to any customer
2        that's interested in buying the product.
3              And when I asked Dr. Figlar, are you
4        making money on that product, are you making
5        money on Eclipse, he said, no, we're losing
6        money on every pack.
7              And I said, well, why do you do it?  And
8        he says he thinks it's the right thing to do,
9        and there may come a time when the public
10        catches up to that and that it will become
11        commercially viable.
12              And it is, without question, from
13        Dr. Cummings and Dr. Figlar, less hazardous.
14        In fact, Dr. Cummings said it was the safest
15        cigarette commercially available in the 1990s.
16              Snus.  Let's talk about Snus.  Yes,
17        there's risk associated with Snus.  There's a
18        warning label on every pack of Snus.  What does
19        it say?  This product can cause mouth cancer.
20              Reynolds is informing customers of that.
21        And no one told you that Snus was less or more
22        harmful than cigarettes, because it's not.
23        It's less risky.  Not risk-free; less risky.
24              And let's talk about VUSE, and that's
25        just another point just to emphasize, I -- I asked Dr. Figlar, where was VUSE
2        manufactured, what facilities was it
3        manufactured in, to this point about sister
4        companies.
5              The fact of the matter is VUSE was -- is
6        manufactured at R.J. Reynolds' facilities, at
7        R.J. Reynolds' facilities.
8              The levels of toxins and carcinogens are
9        below what is detectable with current
10        scientific methods.
11              Is it clear that there's absolutely
12        nothing?  No, but we -- but with current
13        science, they're undetectable.
14              And there are protections.  It was a
15        well-designed product.  He went through that.
16        It's sort of tough to drill down on that in
17        short order, but there are protections for
18        overheating and drying out.  Invested
19        $500 million.
20              There's a voluntary warning label on
21        that.  No one is requiring Reynolds to put a
22        warning label on the VUSE cigarettes.  It does
23        it voluntarily because it's the right thing to
24        do.
25              And then, of course, you heard Dr. Figlar talk about ZONNIC, and Dr. Cummings talk about
2        ZONNIC.  That's the smoking-cessation gum.
3              We inform smokers, if they're concerned
4        about their health, to quit, and there's a
5        product that they can use that will help them
6        quit.  And it's --
7              This is what Dr. Cummings said:  It's
8        sold and displayed, it's cheaper, it's FDA
9        approved, it's advertised on TV, it's right up
10        there with the cigarettes.  So if somebody
11        wants to stop smoking, it's right there in
12        their line of sight.
13              There's no dispute that this is what's
14        going on with R.J. Reynolds.  Certainly,
15        they're still selling cigarettes.
16              And the acquisition of Lorillard is not
17        something to get confused about.  They
18        purchased a brand and they divested themselves
19        of several brands, including the brand -- one
20        of the brands that Mrs. Wilkinson smoked.
21              Again, you can't punish R.J. Reynolds for
22        being in the business of selling cigarettes;
23        but the fact of the matter is, they're offering
24        products and telling customers that if they're
25        concerned about their health, stop, but there are other products that are less risky and
2        we're making -- R.J. Reynolds is making those
3        products available.
4              And what do we know?  And this is the
5        instruction about what's changed.
6              Well, what's changed is that cigarette
7        consumption in this country has dramatically
8        and consistently declined since the 1980s.  No
9        dispute about that.
10              There's an instruction in your packet
11        about mitigating evidence, evidence that you
12        should consider about whether or not to impose
13        punitive damages against R.J. Reynolds.
14              We're going to talk about the Master
15        Settlement Agreement, the Florida Settlement
16        Agreement, we're going to talk about FDA
17        regulation.
18              There are 3100 other cases pending, where
19        other smokers and their families will have
20        their day in court and will be able to make
21        their argument to a jury and decide whether or
22        not they should be awarded damages.
23              This is about awarding punitive damages
24        to Mr. Wilkinson and Ms. Turner in this case.
25        And I want to talk to you about punitive damages paid in other cases.
2              So Reynolds' mitigating evidence, how has
3        Reynolds -- what has Reynolds done?
4        Three billion dollars to the State of Florida.
5        Total payments to all states, $58 billion.
6              And these payments are not over.
7        R.J. Reynolds will continue to pay those
8        payments, not for another five years, not for
9        another seven years, but forever.  Those
10        payments are in perpetuity.
11              Since 1979, the FDA has controlled the
12        manufacture, sale and marketing of tobacco
13        products.  You can consider this evidence when
14        determining whether or not anything is needed
15        today to deter R.J. Reynolds from engaging in
16        any misconduct.
17              The Food and Drug Administration has
18        enforcement powers over R.J. Reynolds.  They
19        make unannounced visits.  If we --
20              If R.J. Reynolds wants to make a change
21        to its product, what does it have to do?  It's
22        got to go to the FDA.  If the FDA doesn't like
23        something in a product, it can take it -- make
24        R.J. Reynolds take it out.  If it doesn't like
25        a product, as Dr. Figlar said, it can take it off the market.
2              And who has to pay for taking it off the
3        market?  R.J. Reynolds.  And we know that
4        that's happened four times, off the market.
5              Mr. Keehfus just told me I misspoke.
6        Since 2009, the FDA has regulated.  He says
7        maybe I said "1979."  Of course, that's not
8        right; it's 2009.
9              Thank you, Jason.
10              Post 2009, not since 1979.
11              You can't change a cigarette product, the
12        design, the flavor, an additive, or anything in
13        a cigarette without the FDA saying "yes" or
14        "no."
15              And that regulatory program, that coming
16        into plants unannounced, that making
17        inspections, that whole process is not paid by
18        the taxpayers, it's not paid by that.  It's
19        paid by R.J. Reynolds and other tobacco
20        companies.  And Reynolds, itself, has paid,
21        just since 2009, over a billion dollars to fund
22        that whole program of FDA control.
23              In these Engle cases, Reynolds has paid
24        $145 million in punitive damages in other Engle
25        cases.  $145 million. Are punitive damages needed to prevent
2        Reynolds from concealing information in 2016?
3        Ask yourself that question.  Are they needed to
4        prevent Reynolds today?  The answer is "no."
5              I talked about this.  You have already
6        decided that they have been fully compensated
7        in this case.  And, as I mentioned before, if
8        you conclude that the purposes of punitive
9        damages are satisfied by the award that you
10        have given each of them in this case, you can
11        decline to award punitive damages and say we've
12        done enough with that.
13              And let's talk about what the
14        instructions say about the reasonableness of --
15        of an award.  The amount must bear a reasonable
16        relationship to the amount of compensatory
17        damages you awarded to Mrs. Turner and
18        Mr. Wilkinson.
19              So that $2.4 million is important for
20        your consideration of what else, if any, should
21        be given to Mrs. Turner and Mr. Wilkinson.  You
22        assigned --
23              In the comparative fault section of the
24        verdict form, you assigned 20 percent fault to
25        Mrs. Wilkinson, right?  That's the line on the verdict form.  And you put 20 percent for
2        Mrs. Wilkinson, 80 percent for R.J. Reynolds.
3        That's why your 1.5 to each of them was reduced
4        to 1.2, and 2.4 total.
5              I suggest to you that a more commonsense,
6        reasonable punitive damages award in this case,
7        if you were inclined to award punitive damages,
8        is to take the 20 percent and add it back in.
9        $300,000 to each of the two individuals.
10              And by doing so, you would be holding
11        R.J. Reynolds not 80 percent responsible, not
12        80 percent responsible for Mrs. Wilkinson's
13        COPD/emphysema and death, but a hundred percent
14        responsible.  A hundred percent.
15              And if --
16              Just to put all of this in context, an
17        award of $600,000 in each pending case for
18        punitive damages would result in more than
19        $1.86 billion just in punitive damages awards.
20        Anything more than that is excessive and
21        doesn't bear a reasonable relation to the
22        compensatory award in this case.  $300,000 to
23        each; $600,000 total.
24              I won't say this again, I'm like a broken
25        record on this particular point, so I'll -- I'll not reiterate this point.
2              Let me close by thanking you again for
3        your service, and asking, when you get back to
4        that jury room --
5              And, again, we urge that you read the
6        instructions carefully before you begin your
7        deliberations, and ask yourself, are punitive
8        damages needed in this case?
9              And this is just a rundown of some of the
10        things we've talked about:
11              Is it needed to make Reynolds stop
12        concealing information?  No.  Reynolds is not
13        concealing information.
14              Is it needed to make more people aware of
15        the dangers?  No.
16              Would it cause smokers to change their
17        behavior?  Would an imposition of punitive
18        damages in this case cause anybody to change
19        their -- smokers to change their behavior?  The
20        answer is no.
21              Would a punitive damages award public --
22        improve public health?  No, because the money
23        doesn't go to public health.  It goes to
24        Mrs. Turner and Mr. Wilkinson.
25              Would a punitive damages award cause the U.S. Congress to somehow consider the legality
2        of cigarettes?  No, it wouldn't.
3              Would it cause the FDA to change the way
4        they regulate cigarettes?  No, of course not.
5        The FDA is going to regulate cigarettes how?
6        Exactly how they want to, because they have
7        full control over that.
8              And would a punitive damages award serve
9        any valid purpose today?  Today?  The fact of
10        the matter is, Reynolds is a changed company.
11              Think of the evidence that you heard in
12        Phase II of this case, that in any way suggests
13        that this is not, in fact, 100 percent correct.
14        And it's not a game of "gotcha," with pulling
15        out one question and answer from Dr. Figlar and
16        making it seem like somehow Reynolds hasn't
17        changed.
18              When Mr. Rosen asked Dr. Figlar about the
19        CTR and TI, and whether it was a public --
20        public relations, he didn't continue to read.
21        He didn't go down further, the next question
22        and answer.
23              And what Dr. Figlar actually said was:
24        Based on what I've read, and the research that
25        I have done, I don't believe the CTR was solely a public relations effort.
2              Of course, it wasn't.  We -- we brought
3        you evidence about funding for grants, ten
4        Nobel scientists, grants that funded research
5        that, in fact, contradicted what Reynolds was
6        saying at the time.  What Dr. Figlar was saying
7        was, of course, it wasn't solely that.
8              And consider the evidence -- the
9        overwhelming evidence that we brought to you
10        that Reynolds is, in fact, changed.  The
11        conduct in the past is, in fact, in the past.
12        It is over and done with.
13              And, again, we ask --
14              Thank you again.  We ask that you read
15        the instructions before you begin
16        deliberations.  Be guided by those and by your
17        common sense.  And thank you again for your
18        service.
