3              MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
4              May it please the Court.
5              Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
6              JURORS:  Good afternoon.
7              MR. GERAGHTY:  You know at this point
8        that my name is Bill Geraghty, and I represent
9        Philip Morris USA in this case.
10              I think it goes without saying that it
11        has been a long trial.  And if you count the
12        voir dire process, we've been together now the
13        better part of two and a half weeks.  And I
14        think we're all happy to be getting close to
15        the end of the case.
16              And I want to start the same way
17        Mr. Schlesinger did, and that is by thanking
18        you for your jury service.  We appreciate very
19        much that you all have made a tremendous
20        sacrifice of your time to be here for the
21        better part of two and a half weeks.
22              And we know from the questions that you
23        yourselves put to the witnesses that you've
24        been paying close attention to the evidence,
25        and we really appreciate that. We are getting very close to the end of
2        the case.  And pretty soon, Judge Murphy is
3        going to give you the final legal instructions
4        and a verdict form.
5              And that verdict form will have the
6        questions that you will answer that will decide
7        the issues in this case.
8              But before you head off to deliberate,
9        this is my opportunity to summarize the
10        evidence that we've seen and heard over the
11        last two weeks.
12              And when I first spoke to you almost two
13        weeks ago, I told you that the plaintiff would
14        spend a lot of time talking about statements
15        made and ideas held by Philip Morris and
16        R.J. Reynolds, many of which were made 30, 40,
17        and in some instances, more than 50 years ago.
18              And I also told you we would not try to
19        defend those statements.
20              Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds made
21        statements and expressed ideas that today, no
22        one would say or think.
23              I told you that for too long, they denied
24        the fact that cigarette smoking caused lung
25        cancer, and that cigarette smoking could be addictive, long after the public already knew
2        those things.
3              And I told you all of that, ladies and
4        gentlemen, two weeks ago before any of the
5        evidence was presented.
6              But I also told you that if that was all
7        this case was about, if all the plaintiff had
8        to prove was that cigarette company executives
9        made inappropriate statements, we wouldn't have
10        spent the last two weeks together.
11              But we did.  And that's because, ladies
12        and gentlemen, this case isn't about all
13        cigarette smokers.
14              The case isn't about whether you believe
15        people should or should not smoke cigarettes.
16              This case is about Virginia Varner, it's
17        about her life, and the decisions that she made
18        about how to live her life.
19              And that's why when you get that verdict
20        form from Judge Murphy, you will see that every
21        question asks you specifically about Virginia
22        Varner.  Not all cigarette smokers and not the
23        general public.
24              Now, you've heard Dr. Proctor.  And
25        Dr. Proctor told you he has made $4 million testifying against Philip Morris and other
2        cigarette companies.
3              He showed you many of the same documents
4        and videotapes that he has shown to literally
5        hundreds of other juries in other cases in
6        which he's testified.
7              What else did Dr. Proctor tell you?  He
8        told you he knew absolutely nothing about
9        Virginia Varner.
10              He told you he had no idea whether
11        Virginia Varner ever read or saw or heard any
12        of the statements or any of the documents that
13        he showed you.
14              After being on the witness stand for four
15        days during that first week of the trial, he
16        told you nothing about Virginia Varner.
17              But now you know that's what this case is
18        all about.
19              You learned during the course of the last
20        two weeks that Virginia Varner was a strong,
21        intelligent, and capable person who lived her
22        life the way she wanted to live it.
23              She told her daughter decades ago in a
24        very matter-of-fact way, "These cigarettes are
25        killing me." Smoking is killing me.  That's what she
2        told her daughter decades ago.  Decades ago.
3              And years later, years later in 1992,
4        when her husband had a heart attack, when he
5        quit smoking and when he encouraged her to quit
6        for the very first time, what did she say to
7        him?
8              Did she say:  I want to quit?  I've tried
9        to quit, but I can't?
10              That's not what she said.  What she said
11        to him, again, in a very matter-of-fact way
12        was, "I am going to die anyway."
13              "I am going to die anyway."
14              And, ladies and gentlemen, that tells you
15        about Virginia Varner's attitude about
16        cigarette smoking.
17              And she made no effort to quit in 1992
18        because she enjoyed smoking cigarettes, she
19        wanted to smoke.  That's what she wanted to do.
20              What else have you heard about Virginia
21        Varner that is undisputed?  Well, Mr. Varner
22        told you that he knew that smoking could cause
23        lung cancer as far back as 1966 when those
24        first warning labels appeared on cigarette
25        packs. He told you he most likely discussed
2        those warning labels with Virginia Varner.
3              You heard that her mother was a heavy
4        cigarette smoker who was diagnosed with
5        emphysema in the late 1970s or early 1980s.
6              Her mother eventually needed a wheelchair
7        and was bedridden from her illness.
8              Around that same period of time, Virginia
9        Varner developed a smoker's cough and a
10        smoker's wheeze.
11              She discussed it with her own doctors.
12        The doctors told her the cough and the wheeze
13        are caused because you smoke cigarettes.
14              She told her daughter Lori at that time,
15        "These cigarettes are killing me."
16              She told her that cigarette smoking was
17        addictive and cigarette smoking is bad for your
18        health.
19              The evidence has shown, ladies and
20        gentlemen, that Virginia Varner knew cigarette
21        smoking was dangerous and potentially addictive
22        for decades before she got lung cancer.
23              So ask yourself why plaintiff spent an
24        hour trying to persuade you that Ms. Varner was
25        somehow tricked into smoking. But what you heard is totally
2        inconsistent with the evidence that we've seen
3        and heard about Virginia Varner over the last
4        two weeks.
5              Now, before I move on, let me say
6        something about the findings from the earlier
7        class action.
8              You heard Judge Murphy's instructions,
9        and there is no debate about this issue.  Those
10        findings don't tell you how to answer any of
11        the questions you will be asked to decide on
12        the verdict form.
13              And that's because, ladies and gentlemen,
14        you get to decide based on your verdict in this
15        case, based on the evidence you've heard over
16        the last two weeks, whether those findings have
17        any applicability to Virginia Varner and the
18        lifestyle choices that she made.
19              I told you in my opening statement two
20        weeks ago this case presents a simple question.
21              Are we going to hold Philip Morris
22        responsible, legally responsible for Virginia
23        Varner's decision to smoke cigarettes and award
24        Joseph Varner millions of dollars in damages
25        when the evidence clearly shows that they lived their lives exactly the way they wanted to live
2        it; they smoked cigarettes because that's what
3        they wanted to do; and they had no real
4        interest in quitting, until the very end.
5              You now know, ladies and gentlemen, that
6        Virginia Varner never made any real effort to
7        quit smoking until 1994, when unfortunately she
8        was diagnosed with lung cancer.
9              You didn't hear anything from
10        Mr. Schlesinger about that at all.
11              You are the only jury that has heard the
12        evidence in Virginia Varner's case, and you get
13        to decide the issues in this case.  You get to
14        decide that, ladies and gentlemen.
15              Now, in just a minute we're going to walk
16        through the significant events in Virginia
17        Varner's life, because this case is about her,
18        and we'll show you that everything I told you
19        in my opening statement has turned out to be
20        true.
21              When I talked to you during the opening
22        statements two weeks ago, I discussed what I
23        called the sources of evidence.  The sources of
24        evidence.  And I asked you to pay close
25        attention to the important sources of evidence. And what did I mean by that?
2              Well, just about everything you saw
3        during the course of this trial came from what
4        Joseph Varner himself told us in his deposition
5        and from what one of his children said in their
6        depositions.
7              And as I predicted two weeks ago, many of
8        the things that Joseph Varner and his children
9        tried to tell you during this trial are
10        inconsistent with or contradicted by what they
11        said in their deposition testimony under oath
12        before the trial started.
13              And I told you that you would get to be
14        the judges of the facts.  You get to decide
15        what testimony you choose to believe in this
16        case.
17              Judge Murphy has given you the
18        instructions.  And in the packet that you've
19        been given, there is an instruction on what's
20        called the believability of witnesses.  I
21        believe it's instruction number 3 in your
22        packet.
23              And this is instruction number 3.
24              It says:  In evaluating the believability
25        of any witness and the weight you will give the testimony of any witness, you may properly
2        consider.  And then there is a series of things
3        for you to consider.
4              Among them is:  Any interest the witness
5        may have in the outcome of the case.
6              And by "interest," we mean a financial
7        interest to what you now appreciate is to the
8        tune of $10 million.
9              The instruction goes on to say that you
10        can consider the reasonableness of the
11        testimony of the witness considered in the
12        light of all the evidence in the case, and in
13        light of your own experience and common sense.
14              Ladies and gentlemen, I encourage you, I
15        ask you, I implore you to use your common sense
16        and your everyday life experiences when you
17        evaluate the testimony you've heard in this
18        case.
19              And that's particularly important when it
20        comes to Mr. Varner and his two children who
21        testified live in this courtroom.
22              Judge Murphy has told you that you can
23        accept or reject any testimony you hear in this
24        case.  And that is your job and your job alone.
25              So let me give you some examples of when Joseph Varner and Lori Cohen and Joey Varner
2        told you one thing from this witness stand
3        during the trial, but said the exact opposite
4        in their depositions under oath.
5              You may remember when Joseph Varner, Sr.
6        testified, the plaintiff.  One of the very
7        first questions I asked him was:  And you had
8        never tried to quit smoking at any point before
9        you had the heart attack in 1992, correct?
10              And he started to say:  I think I did.
11              That's what he told you right from this
12        witness stand under oath.
13              But remember, ladies and gentlemen, we
14        showed you his videotaped deposition testimony
15        from before the trial, and we played it for
16        you.
17              Can you show that, please?
18              This is what he said before the trial on
19        the same point.
20              21           22              follows:)
23              QUESTION:  Had you tried to quit before
24        the time you quit in 1992?
25              ANSWER:  No. (Video clip concluded.)
2              MR. GERAGHTY:  So that was Mr. Varner in
3        his deposition about a year ago in August,
4        saying the exact opposite of what he tried to
5        tell you from the witness stand here during the
6        course of this trial.
7              Now, later I asked him if he loved his
8        current wife, Monique Varner.  This is the
9        testimony from here in court.
10              QUESTION:  You loved Monique, didn't you?
11              ANSWER:  No.
12              Well, isn't it true that you used to love
13        Monique, but not anymore?
14              His answer:  I don't think so, no.
15              But then you may recall the judge allowed
16        me to confront him with the deposition
17        testimony he gave again, about a year before
18        the trial.  And this is what he said.
19              Before the trial, in his deposition under
20        oath, he said:  So I don't love Monique.  I
21        used to, but I don't no more.
22              That was his testimony under oath in his
23        deposition.
24              So you have to ask yourselves, ladies and
25        gentlemen, in a case in which he's now asked to be awarded millions of dollars in damages, if
2        Mr. Varner is willing to deny under oath that
3        he was in love with a woman he lived with for
4        20 years --
5              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.
6              THE COURT:  Excuse me, what is the
7        objection?
8              Overruled.
9              Ladies and gentlemen, you rely on your
10        own recollection of the evidence.
11              Proceed.
12              MR. GERAGHTY:  If Mr. Varner is willing
13        to deny under oath that he was in love with a
14        woman --
15              MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
16        It's mitigation, against the rule.
17              THE COURT:  Thank you.  I've instructed
18        the jury on this point, Counsel.  Overruled.
19              You can proceed, Counsel.
20              MR. GERAGHTY:  If Mr. Varner is willing
21        to deny under oath that he was in love with a
22        woman he spent 20 years with, can you believe
23        anything he tells you when it comes to the
24        substantive facts of this case?
25              What about Lori Cohen?  She told you she moved to South Carolina around the time his
2        father began a relationship with his second
3        wife, Monique Varner.
4              She told you she's only seen her father
5        two or three times in the last 20 years, but if
6        you believe what she said, she also said she'd
7        seen him five or six times just since January
8        of this year.
9              So what did Lori Cohen say?
10              I asked Lori Cohen:  You remember your
11        mother singing a song called Smoke, Smoke,
12        Smoke That Cigarette by a country performer
13        named Tex Williams?
14              Her answer:  I've heard of it.  I don't
15        recall whether it was my mother, but I don't
16        recall -- but I do recall.
17              Don't you recall that your mother sang
18        that song around the house?
19              Her answer:  No, sir, she didn't sing it
20        around the house.
21              That's what Lori Cohen told you from this
22        witness stand in the last two weeks.
23              But then remember, Judge Murphy allowed
24        me to confront her with her deposition
25        testimony given before the trial. Here is what she said in her deposition
2        testimony before trial.
3              Have you ever heard the song Smoke,
4        Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette by a country
5        western artist Tex Williams?
6              ANSWER:  Yes, Smoke.
7              QUESTION:  When do you first recall
8        hearing that song?
9              My mother sang it.
10              Your mother would sing it?
11              ANSWER:  Yeah.
12              That was Lori Cohen's testimony under
13        oath before the trial started.
14              What happened when I confronted her with
15        other testimony in the case?  She initially
16        tried to tell you that her mother tried to quit
17        smoking a couple of times, and when she did,
18        she looked like a heroin addict coming off of
19        heroin.  That's what Lori Cohen told you from
20        this witness stand.
21              But when I cross-examined her, she
22        admitted that her mother never tried to quit
23        smoking when her grandmother was diagnosed with
24        emphysema, when her doctors told her mother
25        that the cough and the wheeze were caused by smoking and when Mr. Varner had a heart attack.
2              And she also admitted to you that to her
3        knowledge, her mother never went a single day
4        without smoking cigarettes.  That was Lori
5        Cohen's testimony.
6              And finally, what about Joseph Varner,
7        Jr.?  He testified that his mother said she
8        wanted to quit smoking numerous times.  He said
9        he heard it a lot.
10              Here is his testimony.  Again, this is on
11        direct examination, when Mr. Hammer was asking
12        the questions.
13              QUESTION:  Based upon your observations,
14        did you observe that your mom wanted to quit?
15              ANSWER:  Yes.
16              Tell us about that, please.
17              ANSWER:  Well, I've heard her say,
18        numerous times, over the years.
19              But this is what he said when I asked him
20        questions on cross-examination.
21              Isn't it true that you don't recall your
22        mother making efforts to quit smoking before
23        she was diagnosed with lung cancer?
24              His answer:  I don't remember.  I don't
25        recall, no. And then I followed up:  And you don't
2        recall your mother stopping smoking for even
3        one day before she was diagnosed with cancer?
4              His answer:  I don't remember.  I don't
5        remember.
6              And, in fact, one of you, ladies and
7        gentlemen, asked him a very insightful
8        question, which the Court then read to him.
9        And the question was:  When did Mrs. Varner
10        first tell you that she wanted to quit smoking?
11              He hemmed and he hawed, but at the end of
12        the day, he said he didn't know.  He didn't
13        know.
14              So, ladies and gentlemen, you get to use
15        your common sense, your personal life
16        experiences, to draw reasonable conclusions and
17        inferences from the evidence and to decide
18        whether or not you're going to believe some of
19        the things that Joseph Varner and his children
20        have told you.
21              And, again, ladies and gentlemen, this is
22        your job and your job alone.
23              Now, you may remember at the very
24        beginning of the case I told you this case was
25        about two words:  control and responsibility. And I asked you to simply ask yourself
2        the following series of questions.  And we're
3        going to walk through all the significant
4        events in Virginia Varner's life again.  And
5        again, I would ask you, ask yourself the
6        following series of questions:  Who was in
7        control of her lifestyle choices?
8              Who was in control of her efforts to quit
9        smoking?
10              Who controlled her motivation to quit?
11        Whether Virginia Varner was ever motivated to
12        quit at any time before 1994.
13              Was Virginia Varner addicted?  And if so,
14        was her addiction so strong, so substantial
15        that it robbed her of her free will?
16              Or was Virginia Varner simply someone who
17        enjoyed smoking cigarettes and had no real
18        interest in quitting, until the very end?
19              And finally ask yourself, did Virginia
20        Varner rely on anything that Philip Morris or
21        R.J. Reynolds said about the health risks or
22        addictive nature of smoking?
23              And when you answer these questions, when
24        you answer these questions on your own, you
25        will know that Virginia Varner was always in control and therefore responsible for her own
2        actions.
3              In this country we all have the right to
4        make decisions for ourselves, even decisions
5        that today, with the benefit of hindsight, we
6        might say were not in her best interests.  We
7        believe in free will.  That is a fundamental
8        principle upon which our country was founded.
9              You have the right to make your own
10        decisions in life, but with that right comes
11        the obligation to accept personal
12        responsibility for the consequences of those
13        decisions.
14              Now let me just very briefly talk about
15        the burden of proof.  Joseph Varner bears the
16        burden of proof on all of his claims in this
17        case by what the Court referred to as the
18        greater weight of the evidence.
19              So what does that mean?  That means that
20        Mr. Varner and his lawyers were required to
21        bring you more persuasive, more convincing
22        evidence than the mountain of evidence that
23        we've presented that Virginia Varner was always
24        in control; that she was not some hopeless,
25        mindless addict who was robbed of her free will; that she was never motivated to quit
2        smoking at any point before her lung cancer
3        diagnosis in 1994.
4              Your Honor, I'm going to move into
5        something else.  So it's 12:30 --
6              THE COURT:  Perfect time to break.
7              MR. GERAGHTY:  -- this might be a good
8        time to take the lunch break.
9              THE COURT:  All right.  Ladies and
10        gentlemen, we will take our luncheon recess
11        now.  Counsel, thank you.
12              I do apologize.  I didn't realize the
13        lunch was there, but it's sitting in front of
14        me.  I get a text from my clerk that it's there
15        all the time.  So I apologize for that.
16              Just remember the admonition.  You're not
17        to discuss the case.  Don't form any opinion
18        about the case.  Don't allow anyone to discuss
19        the case in your presence, certainly no
20        research.  Just leave your notepads on your
21        chairs.
22              Before you go in, my thought is we would
23        like to continue.  I don't know exactly how
24        much time you need to eat your lunch.  45
25        minutes, is that enough time for everybody? JURORS:  Yes.
[#DELETED RECESS#]
2       MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
3 May it please the Court again.
4       Good afternoon, again, ladies and
5 gentlemen.  I hope you all had a good lunch,
6 and I'm going to try to move along here and
7 move us through the afternoon and cover the
8 evidence you've heard.
9       Now I told you we were going to walk
10 through all the significant events in Virginia
11 Varner's life, and we're going to do that right
12 now.  And I'm going to remind you of what we
13 heard over the last two weeks.
14       And I just want to let you know at the
15 front end, this is the same exact timeline that
16 I showed you in my opening statement, exactly
17 the same.  And I'm going to show you that
18 everything we told you in opening statement we
19 have now proved over the course of the last two
20 weeks.
21       So let me start at the beginning.  You
22 know Virginia Varner was born on April the
23 22nd, 1941, in Aiken, South Carolina
24 Security, tobacco country.  We know that her
25 family had a farm back in South Carolina, and they owned a general store where they sold
2 cigarettes.  And that's basically all we really
3 know about her early years.
4       You know her parents are Ralph and
5 Gertrude Woodward and that they are longtime
6 cigarette smokers themselves.
7       And that's important because both
8 Dr. DiFranza and Dr. Ticknor told you that a
9 key predictor in whether someone will start
10 smoking if their parents smoked cigarettes.  So
11 we know that her parents smoked cigarettes.
12       They moved to Miami sometime in the early
13 to mid 1950s.  We're not exactly sure when.
14 They moved down the street from Joseph Varner.
15 He begins to date his wife in 1957 or 1958.
16       And you heard Mr. Varner tell you that he
17 was smoking cigarettes, but he was hiding his
18 cigarette smoking from his parents because he
19 knew they would not approve.  He knew during
20 this period of time that his wife was smoking,
21 but she also did not smoke cigarettes in front
22 of his mother or father.
23       So we don't know much about her cigarette
24 smoking at this point in time.  What we do know
25 is they are smoking filtered cigarettes from the very beginning, filtered cigarettes.
2       In 1959, Joseph and Virginia Varner get
3 married.  You know that their children --
4 Joseph, Jr., born in 1960; Lisa Roberts, 1961;
5 Lori Cohen, 1965.  The family moves to
6 Hollywood in about 1962.
7       Now, you heard Mr. Schlesinger say that
8 the American public didn't know that cigarette
9 smoking could cause cancer and could be
10 addictive.  But after the evidence you heard,
11 you know that's simply not the case and
12 certainly not the case as far as Virginia
13 Varner is concerned.
14       Remember Dr. Proctor testified.  He told
15 you as far back as 1906 or 1907 that the
16 Florida Board of Health had determined that
17 today cigarettes are looked upon by all as the
18 worst form of tobacco addiction, the very worst
19 form of tobacco addiction.  That's in 1906,
20 1907.
21       You heard about "coffin nails" and
22 "cancer sticks" and "nicotine fiends" and
23 "nicotine fits."  These were terms people used
24 to refer to cigarettes and cigarette smokers
25 over a hundred years ago. And Mr. Varner told you he heard the
2 terms "coffin nails" and "cancer sticks."  He
3 understood exactly what those terms meant.  He
4 heard the song Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That
5 Cigarette.  He told you he was sure his wife
6 heard it as well.  And they understood, even
7 though they were joking about it, that it meant
8 you can puff, puff, puff yourself to death.
9       You heard that in the 1930s and '40s and
10 '50s popular magazines like Reader's Digest
11 published articles about cigarette smoking.
12       And these are just some of examples that
13 we showed you from 1935, '38, '41, '52.  And
14 these articles talked about the fact that
15 cigarettes cause cancer.
16       Cigarettes have nicotine in them, and the
17 nicotine in cigarettes can be addictive, and
18 people can become addicted to smoking
19 cigarettes.  That's in Reader's Digest magazine
20 in the 1930s, '40s and '50s.
21       As we move further along on the timeline
22 to the early 1950s, you heard that scientific
23 studies are published that specifically link
24 cigarette smoking with lung cancer.
25       And you'll remember the article in Life Magazine.  This is "Smoke Gets In The News"
2 from Life Magazine, December of 1953.
3       We walked through all those pictures with
4 Dr. Proctor.  It says:  Doctors report tobacco
5 tar induces mouse cancer.  Note:  Rise in
6 cigarette use and human lung cancer.  This is
7 1953.
8       And you also heard that six months after
9 this Life Magazine article comes out, there is
10 a poll conducted that shows that 90 percent of
11 the American public had read or heard something
12 to the effect that cigarette smoking may be a
13 cause of cancer of the lung.  May be a cause of
14 cancer of the lung.
15       That's in June of 1954, when Virginia
16 Varner would have been 12 years old, just 12
17 years old.
18       Now you heard that the publicity that
19 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer continues
20 to build throughout the 1950s and the 1960s,
21 and that brings us to January of 1964.
22       Virginia Varner is 22 years old, and in
23 January of 1964, the United States Surgeon
24 General issues a report that says cigarette
25 smoking causes lung cancer. Can you see the screen?  Is this blocking
2 the screen?  Let me move --
3       JUROR:  I can see.
4       MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.  Are you sure?
5       JUROR:  I can see.  I appreciate it.
6       MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.
7       The Surgeon General in January 1964 says
8 cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, chronic
9 bronchitis and increases the risk of dying from
10 emphysema.
11       And you know that those studies, the
12 Surgeon General's Report, front-page news on
13 newspapers and magazines all across the United
14 States, including right here in Broward County.
15       This is the Hollywood Sun Tattler, the
16 paper that you heard Lori Cohen and Lisa
17 Roberts say that the Varner family got in their
18 home.
19       This is Friday, January 10th, 1964:
20 Report to cite cigarette hazards.
21       Virginia Varner is 22 years old.
22       Here is the very next day.  Same paper,
23 Hollywood Sun Tattler:  Cigarettes major health
24 hazard.
25       This is the one I showed in my opening. This is from the Florida Sun-Sentinel, January
2 12th, 1964:  Smoking called "grave" hazard.
3 Grave hazard.
4       We showed you the broadcast from CBS News
5 and Harry Reasoner, so you know that every
6 American, including Virginia Varner, was told
7 in 1964 that cigarette smoking causes lung
8 cancer.  And this is a key event in the
9 timeline.
10       Remember what Dr. Proctor told you.
11 Plaintiff's own expert, Dr. Proctor.  He told
12 you the 1964 Surgeon General's Report was the
13 beginning of the end of cigarettes in this
14 country.  The beginning of the end of
15 cigarettes.
16       He told you it was the turning point on
17 smoking rates.
18       And he told you it began an unprecedented
19 era of quitting smoking in this country.
20       You heard Mr. Schlesinger talk about
21 total cigarette consumption.  Well, Dr. Proctor
22 told you in 1964 adult per capita cigarette
23 consumption peaked in 1964, and it has been on
24 a steady decline ever since, in 1964.
25       So two years later, in 1966, the very first warning appears on cigarettes.  It says:
2 Caution, cigarette smoking may be hazardous to
3 your health.
4       Here is the pack you saw in evidence
5 several times.  It's a pack of Marlboros with
6 that warning label on the side.
7       This warning was printed on every pack of
8 cigarettes sold in the United States beginning
9 in January of 1966 when Virginia Varner would
10 have been 24 years old.  24 years old.
11       And it appeared on every pack of
12 cigarettes sold.  Filtered, unfiltered, you
13 name it, that warning appeared on it.
14       Mr. Varner testified that he learned a
15 long time ago that cigarette smoking could
16 cause lung cancer, and he referred specifically
17 to this warning label as the source of why he
18 believed that.
19       He told you that he and his wife most
20 likely discussed this warning label all the way
21 back in 1966.
22       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge, not a
23 warning label.
24       THE COURT:  Thank you.  Objection noted.
25 It's overruled. MR. GERAGHTY:  He said:  I'm sure we
2 probably talked about it.  It's just common
3 sense that if they put this on the pack of
4 cigarettes you're going to talk about it.
5       Here's his testimony about the warning
6 label; and it's a little bit long, but let me
7 walk you through it.  And I'm asking the
8 questions.
9       And it says:  This is what you meant when
10 you referred to the fact that you had heard --
11 and we are talking over one another.
12       He says, Answer, "that it may cause --"
13       And I asked him:  That cigarette smoking
14 may cause lung cancer, quote, a long time ago?
15       His answer is:  Yes.
16       So you knew this warning was on the pack
17 back in 1966?
18       His answer:  Yeah.
19       And a few minutes later, I asked him the
20 following question:  The label on the screen
21 here, you remember that when you saw this
22 label, you associated in your mind that the
23 warning had something to do with lung cancer?
24       And he says:  Yes.
25       That's Mr. Varner's testimony that you heard right in this courtroom during the course
2 of the trial.
3       And remember now, ladies and gentlemen,
4 at this point in time, he and his wife are both
5 smoking Marlboro Red cigarettes.  Filtered
6 Marlboro Red cigarettes.
7       And all of this, ladies and gentlemen,
8 took place more than 50 years ago.  More than
9 50 years ago.
10       Let's go to the next page of the
11 timeline.  And we're going to start below the
12 blue bar.  I know it's a little tough for you
13 all to see it, but I'll try to walk you through
14 it.
15       In 1970, Congress changes the warning
16 label.  And the warning label as of 1970 says:
17 The Surgeon General has determined that
18 cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.
19       And here's, again, a pack of Marlboro
20 cigarettes with that warning label that first
21 began to appear in 1970, right on the side of
22 the pack.
23       One year later in 1971, all cigarette ads
24 are taken off of television and radio here in
25 the United States. And in 1972, this Surgeon General's
2 warning is required to appear on any cigarette
3 advertisement in a newspaper, a magazine, or on
4 a billboard.
5       Now, Mr. Varner told you that he and his
6 wife didn't really pay much attention to this
7 warning because, as he put it:  It didn't tell
8 them anything they didn't already know.
9       It didn't tell them anything they didn't
10 already know.
11       And think about it, ladies and gentlemen.
12 You heard the evidence.  During this period of
13 time, the late 1960s and early 1970s, there's
14 an incredible amount of information published
15 about the health risks of smoking.
16       You saw the public service announcements;
17 Bill Talman, John Wayne.  We talked about John
18 Wayne.
19       You remember Mr. Varner's testimony about
20 John Wayne.  He referred to John Wayne as one
21 of his heroes.  And Mr. Varner told you he knew
22 that John Wayne had been diagnosed with lung
23 cancer because he smoked cigarettes by the
24 early 1970s.  He told you that.
25       And you saw the public service announcement that he gave.
2       Now, the plaintiff has tried to tell you
3 that somehow all these warnings and health
4 messages were being drowned out by statements
5 made by cigarette companies.
6       But remember what even Dr. Proctor had to
7 admit.  He told you that between 1974 when that
8 very first Surgeon General's Report came out
9 and 1979, 30 million Americans quit smoking.
10       Thirty million people quit smoking during
11 that 15-year period.
12       That's 2 million people every single
13 year.  And this is during the same period of
14 time that you saw all those public statements
15 by the Tobacco Institute saying:  We don't
16 know.  Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.  All
17 during that same period of time.
18       Nevertheless, 30 million Americans quit
19 smoking because of the same warnings and the
20 same health messages that Joseph and Virginia
21 Varner received.
22       And remember again, this is during a
23 period of time, there is no nicotine
24 replacement therapy.  There is no Nicorette
25 gum, there is no nicotine patch, there's no Zyban, there's no Chantix.
2       But millions quit smoking cold turkey,
3 and they quit for good.  And that's the
4 evidence you've heard over the course of the
5 last two weeks.
6       Of course, ladies and gentlemen, the
7 evidence now shows Mrs. Varner received those
8 same warnings and health messages.
9       How do we know that?  Well, we know that
10 because you heard in the late 1970s or early
11 1980s, her mother, Gertrude Woodward, develops
12 emphysema.
13       And you now know that emphysema is a type
14 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or
15 COPD, that is caused by smoking cigarettes.
16       You heard the testimony from Lori Cohen
17 and Lisa Roberts.
18       So what all did you hear?  You heard that
19 Gertrude Woodward was a heavy cigarette smoker;
20 that she was diagnosed with emphysema because
21 she smoked cigarettes; that she had serious
22 breathing problems.  Her condition got worse
23 and worse over the years.
24       Lisa Roberts told you that her
25 grandmother, her mother's mother, had to use a wheelchair, and eventually was bedridden
2 because of her emphysema.
3       And, most importantly, you heard that
4 Virginia Varner took care of her mother during
5 this period of time, took her to many of her
6 doctor's appointments for her emphysema.
7       Gertrude Woodward lived in the house next
8 door to Mr. and Mrs. Varner during the period
9 of time when this all happens.
10       So, ladies and gentlemen, there is no
11 question based on the evidence you've heard
12 that Virginia Varner saw firsthand the serious
13 health problems that cigarette smoking could
14 cause in her own mother.
15       In fact, during the same period of time,
16 the early to mid 1980s, 1982 or 1983, you heard
17 Virginia Varner develops a smoker's wheeze and
18 cough.
19       She attributes the smoker's cough and
20 wheeze to her cigarette smoking.  She goes to
21 see the doctors.
22       The doctors tell her:  You're wheezing
23 and you're coughing because you smoke
24 cigarettes.
25       You heard all of that from Lori Cohen. Here is what Lori Cohen told you when she
2 testified.
3       QUESTION:  Your mother told you that her
4 smoker's cough and her smoker's wheeze were
5 caused by cigarette smoking, right?
6       Her answer:  Correct.
7       Your mother told you that her doctors
8 told her that the wheeze and the cough were
9 caused by her cigarette smoking?
10       And her answer is:  Correct.
11       That's what you heard from Lori Cohen.
12       And, of course, you know Virginia Varner
13 appreciates the significance of what the
14 doctors told her.
15       At first, Lori Cohen tried to deny this,
16 but she eventually acknowledged that almost
17 every morning, her mother would cough and
18 wheeze and say:  These cigarettes are killing
19 me.  Smoking is killing me.
20       Here's the testimony.
21       "When do you first recall having a
22 discussion with your mother during which she
23 said something to the effect smoking is killing
24 me?
25       "My mother would say that every morning when she got up and coughed and couldn't
2 breathe."
3       That's undisputed testimony you've heard
4 in this case, ladies and gentlemen.
5 Undisputed.
6       Now, the plaintiff has suggested to you
7 that even though the doctors told her that the
8 cough and the wheeze were caused by smoking,
9 that somehow the doctors never told Virginia
10 Varner that she should quit smoking.
11       But just think about that for one minute.
12       Judge Murphy has instructed you that you
13 can draw reasonable inferences from the
14 evidence and use reason and common sense and
15 your everyday life experiences.
16       What was the evidence you heard?  You
17 heard from three medical doctors:  Dr. Gup,
18 Dr. DiFranza, Dr. Ticknor.  All of them have
19 been practicing medicine since the late 1970s.
20 And what did they tell you?
21       All three of them told you they tell
22 every one of their patients to quit smoking.
23 They tell their patients to quit smoking,
24 because when you quit, your risk of developing
25 lung cancer and COPD goes down, even if you've been smoking for many years.
2       The sooner you quit, the better your
3 chances are of avoiding a smoking-related
4 illness.
5       So, ladies and gentlemen, your common
6 sense and your everyday life experiences and
7 the evidence you've heard in this case tells
8 you, of course the doctors told Virginia Varner
9 to quit.
10       But we know that Virginia Varner didn't
11 listen to her doctors.  Even Lori Cohen
12 admitted to you, her mother did not try to quit
13 smoking when the doctors told her the smoker's
14 cough and wheeze were caused by smoking.
15       And based on the testimony you've heard
16 in this case, if Ms. Varner had followed her
17 doctor's advice, she likely never would have
18 developed lung cancer, and we wouldn't be here
19 today.
20       Now, in 1985 -- we move forward, we're
21 below the blue bar here -- the warning labels
22 on cigarette packs change again.
23       One of the warnings says:  Surgeon
24 General's warning.  Smoking causes lung cancer,
25 heart disease, emphysema and may complicate pregnancy.
2       That's what the warning label said.
3       Again, Joseph Varner told you he and his
4 wife didn't pay attention to this warning,
5 because it didn't tell them anything they
6 hadn't already known for years at this point in
7 time.
8       So what did Mrs. Varner do with all this
9 information?  What does the evidence show?
10       Well, plaintiff's own experts tell you
11 the most important factor that determines
12 whether someone will quit is motivation.  Are
13 you motivated to quit.
14       Dr. Ticknor told you the same thing.
15 Simply put, unless you really want to quit,
16 unless you really try to quit, you're not going
17 to quit.
18       And the evidence in this case shows that
19 Virginia and Joseph Varner enjoyed smoking
20 cigarettes.  And for many years, they simply
21 had no interest in quitting.
22       Ms. Varner enjoyed smoking Marlboro Red
23 cigarettes.  She enjoyed the taste of Marlboro
24 Red.  You heard she liked to double inhale.
25 She taught her husband how to double inhale. She enjoyed smoking when she drank coffee
2 in the morning, when she socialized with her
3 girlfriends, after meals, when she drank
4 alcohol, when her and her husband would retire
5 to their bedroom and watch television in the
6 evening.
7       Now, Joseph Varner, right here on the
8 witness stand, denied that his wife enjoyed
9 smoking cigarettes.  That's what he did.
10       He told you he knew she was addicted.  He
11 knew she was addicted, but he didn't think she
12 enjoyed smoking.  He refused to admit that his
13 wife, with whom he had spent 35 years together,
14 enjoyed smoking.
15       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.  What
16 he admits.  It's attacking the prosecution of
17 the case, what he refused to admit.
18       THE COURT:  I sustain the objection.
19       MR. GERAGHTY:  He denied on the witness
20 stand that his wife enjoyed smoking cigarettes,
21 his wife with whom he had lived for 35 years.
22       That's why we talked about all of the
23 things that he and his wife enjoyed doing
24 together.
25       Remember, he told you about the motorcycle club?  What did he tell you?  He
2 told you his wife and he would ride on his
3 motorcycle, go to the club, socialize with
4 friends, shoot pool, drink beer, dance, and
5 smoke cigarettes.
6       And he told you that they enjoyed doing
7 every single one of those things all the time,
8 except smoke cigarettes.  That's what he told
9 you.
10       But, of course, they did.  Who wouldn't,
11 ladies and gentlemen?  These are all activities
12 that your common sense and everyday life
13 experience tells you people enjoy doing.
14       But Mr. Varner denied that his wife
15 enjoyed smoking cigarettes while doing many of
16 these things.  He's 100 percent confident she's
17 addicted, but he doesn't know whether she
18 enjoyed smoking.
19       And that's why, ladies and gentlemen, we
20 asked him all those questions.
21       Because the truth is and the evidence
22 shows you can't live with someone for almost 35
23 years and not know what they enjoy, what they
24 love to do.  That's what being in a
25 relationship is all about. And, of course, Lori Cohen and Lisa
2 Roberts, her two daughters, what did they tell
3 you?  They said of course their mother enjoyed
4 smoking cigarettes, and they gave you many
5 examples.
6       So how do you square the evidence you
7 heard about Virginia Varner from her two
8 daughters with the testimony that her husband
9 gave?
10       It's very simple.  He said all those
11 things on the witness stand after he's filed a
12 lawsuit in which he's now asked you to award
13 him --
14       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
15       THE COURT:  Your objection is noted.
16       Overruled.
17       MR. GERAGHTY:  He said all of those
18 things to you on the witness stand under oath
19 after he's filed a lawsuit in which he's now
20 asked you, ladies and gentlemen, to award him
21 $10 million.
22       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor,
23 that attacks the prosecution of this case.
24       THE COURT:  Thank you.
25       No speaking objections.  If you want to approach, I'm more than happy to do it.
2       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, I do.
3       (The following discussion was held at
4       sidebar:)
5       THE COURT:  You don't think that goes to
6 bias and motivation?
7       MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the
8 Court.  I think that --
9       THE COURT:  You don't believe it goes to
10 bias?  That's my question.
11       MR. SCHLESINGER:  The money goes to bias
12 and motivation, but the way he said it was that
13 he's attacking his right to file a lawsuit.
14       You can say does he have an interest in
15 getting money.
16       They completely have turned the idea of
17 what you can talk about on its head and say
18 anytime we say anything, we're attacking the
19 defense.
20       He has every right to file a lawsuit.
21 They are attacking his right to file a lawsuit.
22       They can say he's asking for money
23 damages.  You can consider his bias and
24 motivation because he's seeking a monetary
25 award. But they say because he had filed a
2 lawsuit claiming money damages.  He has an
3 absolute right to do that.  For them to attack
4 that is directly on point with what they
5 vociferously say we did.
6       So in this situation, that was the
7 directly improper wording of it.  That's the
8 directly improper wording of it.
9       He can spin this case, he's seeking
10 money.  He can say you can consider that with
11 his credibility, bias, because he seeks money.
12       But you can't say that after he filed a
13 lawsuit, because you're attacking his right to
14 file a lawsuit.
15       THE COURT:  Thank you.
16       Wish to be heard?
17       MR. GERAGHTY:  No, sir.
18       THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.
19       You said you wanted to know when an hour
20 was coming up.  You have an hour and ten
21 minutes, approximately.
22       MR. GERAGHTY:  I have an hour and ten?
23       Oh, I'm at an hour and ten?
24       THE COURT:  You'll be at an hour in ten
25 minutes.  I misspoke.  I'm sorry. (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
2       following was held in open court:)
3       THE COURT:  Counsel, when you're ready,
4 you may proceed.
5       MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
6       That raises the question, did Virginia
7 Varner make any serious effort to quit smoking
8 before she was diagnosed with lung cancer in
9 1994?
10       Now, after two weeks together, you
11 haven't heard any credible or reliable evidence
12 to support that.
13       In fact, the overwhelming evidence you've
14 heard demonstrates that she never made any
15 effort to quit before her lung cancer
16 diagnosis.
17       First, you heard from Joey Varner, who he
18 told -- he told you:  I think my mother said
19 she wanted to quit smoking.
20       But he admitted he doesn't recall her
21 ever making any effort to quit smoking at all.
22 At any point in time.
23       You heard from Lisa Roberts.  Lisa
24 Roberts told you flat out:  My mother never
25 said she wanted to quit smoking, and I never observed her ever try to quit at any point in
2 time, until she had lung cancer in 1994.
3       And Mr. Varner reluctantly agreed to the
4 same thing.
5       The only one who claims her mother tried
6 to quit smoking a couple of times was Lori
7 Cohen.
8       And she told you her mother, after
9 stopping cigarettes for a couple of hours,
10 acted like a heroin addict coming off of
11 heroin.  That's what she told you.
12       Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
13 Don't you think that if there was any truth to
14 what Lori Cohen told you about that, someone
15 else in the family would have observed that,
16 remembered it, and told you the same thing here
17 in this courtroom?
18       After all, everyone said that they
19 basically saw Virginia Varner every single day.
20 Mr. Varner, his son Joseph Varner, Lisa
21 Roberts.
22       Lori Cohen's testimony simply doesn't
23 square with everything else you now know about
24 how Virginia Varner lived her life.
25       To understand Ms. Varner's attitude about cigarette smoking, all you have to do is look
2 at what happened when her husband had the heart
3 attack in 1992.
4       And that's right here.
5       You may recall I told you I wasn't sure
6 if the evidence would show it was '89 or '92.
7       But Mr. Varner told you, in 1992 that he
8 had a heart attack, he was rushed to the
9 emergency room.  The doctors told him:  If you
10 don't quit, you're going to have another heart
11 attack and die, and he quit smoking cold turkey
12 right there on the spot.
13       That's what he told you.
14       And then he said for the very first time
15 in his life, the very first time in their
16 marriage in 1992, he first encouraged his wife
17 to quit smoking.  That's what he told you.
18       And this is what his testimony was about
19 that.
20       QUESTION:  Now, at the time that you had
21 the heart attack and you quit in 1992, you told
22 your wife, Virginia Varner, that she should
23 quit smoking too?
24       His answer:  Yes.
25       And you looked right at her and you told her:  Do not smoke cigarettes?
2       ANSWER:  Yes.
3       You told her:  Smoking will kill you,
4 right?
5       His answer:  Yes.
6       And she kind of joked in response and
7 said:  Well, I'm going to die anyway.
8       His answer:  Yes.
9       That is the undisputed testimony of
10 Joseph Varner in this case.  That's what he
11 told you.
12       And, frankly, this response tells you
13 everything you need to know about Virginia
14 Varner's feelings about cigarette smoking.
15       Mr. Schlesinger told you 1992 was not an
16 important date.  It's the key date.  Because
17 here we are, she smoked cigarettes at this
18 point for the better part of 35 years.
19       She's watched her mother develop
20 emphysema.  She's watched her husband have a
21 heart attack.  And what is her attitude?  I'm
22 going to die anyway.
23       And it wasn't some fatalistic comment.
24 He told you, she joked.
25       So if this is what she thinks about cigarette smoking in 1992, after all of that,
2 what makes you think that at any point in time
3 prior to this date she ever really had any
4 interest in quitting?
5       There is zero evidence of that in the
6 record.
7       This is the most specific statement any
8 of her family members have told us about her
9 true attitude about cigarette smoking.
10       And the plaintiff says it's not
11 important.
12       Well, at the end of the day, ladies and
13 gentlemen, you get to decide what evidence is
14 important.
15       But what you also heard, what you also
16 heard is that Virginia Varner does make a
17 significant change in her behavior.
18       She stops smoking around her husband in
19 1992 when he quits.
20       And everyone told you this, ladies and
21 gentlemen.  Everyone.  There is absolutely no
22 dispute about this.  Joseph Varner himself,
23 Lori Cohen, Lisa Roberts.
24       Think about the significance of that.
25 This is after they've been married for 35 years, during which they smoked around one
2 another every single day.
3       In the morning with coffee, after meals,
4 in the evenings, when they're at the motorcycle
5 club.  They used to smoke together every single
6 night in their bedroom watching the local news
7 or the Johnny Carson show.  Mr. Varner said it
8 was a ritual.
9       But in 1992, when it's important to her
10 because her husband no longer smokes, Ms.
11 Varner controls where, when, and how much she
12 smokes, because it's important to her husband.
13       And the fact that Ms. Varner could
14 control where and when she smoked is important,
15 because you heard if you can control your use
16 of a substance, then you're not addicted.
17       And when it was important, when it
18 mattered to her, Virginia Varner controlled her
19 smoking.  That's the undisputed evidence in the
20 case.
21       That brings us to 1994.  You've already
22 heard all this.  You know that she has -- she
23 coughs up blood.  She goes to see the doctor.
24 Dr. Gup tells her that she probably has lung
25 cancer. They have a bronchoscopy that confirms
2 that diagnosis.  And she's scheduled to have
3 exploratory surgery to determine whether the
4 cancer can be removed and she can be cured.
5       And about two weeks before that surgery,
6 Virginia Varner quits smoking.
7       And this is that record.  This record is
8 in evidence.  You've seen it a couple times
9 already.
10       But this is the record where on August
11 the 18th, she tells the anesthesiologist who
12 is going to be part of the surgical procedure:
13 I quit smoking two weeks ago.
14       That's what the record shows.
15       Now, you know that on August the 22nd,
16 they have the surgery.  And, unfortunately, the
17 doctors determined that the cancer was
18 inoperable; meaning, it can't be removed, and
19 there is no cure.
20       And the doctors tell Ms. Varner and her
21 family that she only has six months left to
22 live.  And, unfortunately, you heard that she
23 passes away in January of 1995.
24       Now, you heard that Virginia Varner quit
25 smoking a few weeks before the surgery. Everyone agreed that she quit smoking in August
2 of 1994.  Joseph Varner, Sr., Joseph Varner,
3 Jr., Lisa Roberts.  They all told you they
4 never saw Virginia Varner smoke another
5 cigarette again after this diagnosis.
6       Lori Cohen told you that after her mother
7 learned that her condition was terminal and
8 there was no cure, that she would give her
9 mother one or two cigarettes each day in those
10 last couple of months.
11       But even if you accept Ms. Cohen's
12 testimony on this point, all of the experts
13 told you that this was an incredibly
14 significant change in Virginia Varner's smoking
15 behavior.
16       To go from smoking one to two packs of
17 cigarettes a day to no cigarettes, to one to
18 two cigarettes per day, particularly in light
19 of what she was dealing with, is a significant
20 change in her smoking behavior.
21       So there will be no question that
22 Virginia Varner had the willpower when she
23 decided to apply it to control her smoking and
24 to quit smoking when she was motivated to do
25 so. Now, real briefly, you heard that
2 Mr. Varner begins to date about a year after
3 his wife died.  You heard that he met a woman
4 named Regina Brown.  She moved in with him, and
5 that relationship lasted about six months.
6       And not long thereafter, in 1996, he
7 meets Monique Varner.  They start a
8 relationship.  Monique moves in with Mr. Varner
9 shortly thereafter.  They have a daughter named
10 Brianna, who is born in 2002, a few years
11 later, and they get married in 2007.
12       And you heard that they continued to live
13 together for the next seven or eight years,
14 until late 2014 or 2015, when they apparently
15 got separated.
16       And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the
17 story that we've all seen and heard in this
18 courtroom over the last two weeks.  That's the
19 evidence.
20       Now, ladies and gentlemen, with the time
21 I have remaining, I want to switch gears with
22 you, which I like to do.
23       I told you that this case was about two
24 words:  Control and responsibility.
25       And even though that's what this case is all about, you won't see those two specific
2 words on the verdict form.
3       So with the time I have left, I'd like to
4 talk to you about the questions you will have
5 to answer on the verdict form.
6       THE COURT:  Thirty minutes, Counsel.
7       MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
8       So here is the very first question, the
9 class membership question you're going to be
10 asked to decide.
11       Was Virginia Varner addicted to
12 cigarettes containing nicotine?  And if so, was
13 such addiction a legal cause of her lung cancer
14 or her COPD?
15       And I told you in the opening statement
16 you could break this question down into really
17 two pieces.
18       The first part is, was she addicted; and
19 if so, number 2, was her claimed addiction a
20 legal cause of her lung cancer and death or
21 COPD.
22       If you answer "no" to this question,
23 that's a verdict for Philip Morris.
24       If you were to answer "yes" to this
25 question, that means you've decided to award some money damages to Joseph Varner.
2       Keep in mind that the plaintiff bears the
3 burden of proof on this question by the greater
4 weight of the evidence.
5       So the first part of the question asks:
6 Was Virginia Varner addicted to cigarettes?
7 Was she addicted to cigarettes?
8       In the instructions you've been given,
9 the Court did not give you a definition of
10 addiction or a set of criteria to use to
11 determine whether someone is addicted.
12       So what is the evidence you've heard?
13       Well, plaintiff brought you Dr. Gup
14 first.  And Dr. Gup is the pulmonologist, the
15 lung doctor who saw Mrs. Varner 22 years ago in
16 1994.
17       And because it was more than 20 years
18 ago, he told you he doesn't remember anything
19 about his care and treatment of Virginia
20 Varner, but he acknowledged that when he first
21 saw her on July the 21st, it was a very busy
22 clinic.
23       He was in a hurry, and he didn't have the
24 ability to spend much time with her.  He told
25 you all those things. During that first visit when he wrote
2 down his impression "tobacco addiction,"
3 Dr. Gup admitted that the only thing he knew
4 about Virginia Varner's smoking history was
5 that she had smoked two packs a day for
6 40 years and she had cut down to about one pack
7 per day in the month before he saw her.  He
8 told you that's all he knew about her smoking
9 history.
10       And from his perspective, that's all he
11 needed to know.  He said:  As far as I was
12 concerned, that meant she was addicted.
13       He also told you that he did nothing
14 further to confirm his impression.  Why is that
15 important?  Well, remember what he also told
16 you.  When he suspected that she had lung
17 cancer he ordered a follow-up test, the
18 bronchoscopy, to confirm that she did, in fact,
19 have lung cancer.
20       When he suspected that she had COPD, he
21 ordered another follow-up test, the pulmonary
22 function test.  But after he wrote "tobacco
23 addiction" in his note, he did nothing further
24 to confirm that, even though he said it was
25 intended to be a medical diagnosis. Dr. Gup didn't even know that Virginia
2 Varner had quit smoking about two weeks before
3 the surgery.  Told you he didn't know that.
4       And finally, he told you that Virginia
5 Varner was not unique among his patients.  He
6 says he writes down the impression "tobacco
7 addiction" in literally thousands of his
8 patient's charts.  That's what he told you.
9       Simply put, saying she was addicted was
10 not meaningful to his care and treatment.  He
11 told you:  I would have treated her exactly the
12 same whether or not I wrote down tobacco
13 addiction.
14       You then heard from Dr. DiFranza.  He was
15 from the University of Massachusetts.  He was
16 the very nice professorial doctor.  But, ladies
17 and gentlemen, he's just not a specialist in
18 addiction.
19       He's a family doctor who told you he
20 treats whatever comes through the front door of
21 his office, from young children to the elderly,
22 for sinus infections, colds, the flu.  He
23 doesn't treat people for nicotine addiction.
24       He has no practical experience diagnosing
25 or treating people who are using addictive substances, including cigarettes.
2       He's never been involved in working in a
3 smoking cessation clinic.
4       Sometimes the lawyers actually ask
5 questions that are as revealing as the answer
6 the witness gives, and you may recall that
7 Dr. DiFranza was asked whether or not he just
8 works in an "ivory tower."  That was the term
9 that was used.
10       Now Dr. DiFranza tried to say, no, he
11 doesn't, but the rest of the testimony
12 demonstrates that's exactly what he does when
13 it comes to nicotine and cigarettes.
14       He told you that if a patient comes to
15 his office with a real addiction problem, guess
16 who he refers them to?  A clinical psychiatrist
17 in the psychiatry department at the University
18 of Massachusetts, a doctor just like
19 Dr. Christopher Ticknor.
20       When it comes to cigarettes, Dr. DiFranza
21 is an academic.  He told you he actually goes
22 upstairs to his office and does research and
23 writing on his computer about nicotine, the
24 so-called "ivory tower."
25       He doesn't have any real-world practical experience when it comes to diagnosing someone
2 as addicted, let alone diagnosing them as
3 addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes.
4       And he candidly acknowledged that.
5       He told you Ms. Varner was addicted, and
6 he talked about different tests and different
7 criteria that he used.  But did you ever hear
8 him explain the criteria that he applied to
9 Virginia Varner and how she satisfied that
10 criteria?  He never explained any of that to
11 you.
12       And that's because, ladies and gentlemen,
13 in every single case he's testified, he's told
14 you the cigarette smoker is addicted.  He
15 believes all cigarette smokers are addicted.
16 If you smoke one cigarette per day, you are
17 addicted, according to him.  In fact, he said,
18 you smoke one cigarette a month and you're
19 probably addicted.  That's his standard.
20 That's his criteria.
21       Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
22 If someone drinks a glass of wine every day or
23 even a couple of glasses of wine on the
24 weekend, are they an alcoholic?  But that's
25 essentially what Dr. DiFranza told you. If you believe what he said, everyone is
2 addicted to something, whether it's cigarettes,
3 alcohol, shopping, you name it.  He had no
4 standard whatsoever.
5       He determined that Virginia Varner was
6 addicted based on a telephone conversation that
7 he had with Joseph Varner.  And he had that
8 conversation with Mr. Varner and determined
9 that she was addicted without reading any of
10 her medical records, without reading any of the
11 depositions that her family members had given
12 in this case.
13       He had reached that conclusion after the
14 phone conversation with Mr. Varner even though
15 he admitted to you that Mr. Varner told him:  I
16 can't recall any instance in which my wife ever
17 tried to quit smoking, in all the years we were
18 married.  He agreed with that twice during the
19 course of his testimony.
20       So ask yourselves, ladies and gentlemen,
21 is that how we diagnose people in this country
22 with a serious mental disorder?  Of course not.
23 Your common sense tells you of course not.
24       The evidence we have presented
25 demonstrates that Virginia Varner was not addicted.
2       We brought you Dr. Ticknor, a medical
3 doctor and board-certified psychiatrist.  He
4 told you he's diagnosed and treated thousands
5 of patients with addictions to a whole variety
6 of addictive substances, including cigarettes.
7 He's evaluated, interviewed, diagnosed and
8 helped thousands of cigarette smokers quit in
9 the course of his career.
10       Unlike Dr. DiFranza, he sees patients on
11 a weekly basis who have substance abuse and
12 addiction problems.  He evaluates them,
13 determines whether they are addicted, and he
14 helps them stop using those substances.
15       People come to him specifically for help
16 in quitting smoking.  He ran a smoking
17 cessation clinic for eight years.
18       He told you that addiction is, in fact, a
19 medical diagnosis, and we just don't cavalierly
20 label millions of people as addicts simply
21 because they smoke a certain number of
22 cigarettes.
23       He applied the same criteria to Virginia
24 Varner that he's used to diagnose thousands of
25 patients as potentially addicted to a whole variety of substances:  heroin, alcohol,
2 cocaine and cigarettes.
3       This is the same criteria he told you is
4 used to teach medical students and young
5 residents --
6       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.
7       THE COURT:  What is the objection,
8 Counsel?
9       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sidebar, Judge.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
19       THE COURT:  When you're ready, you may
20 proceed.
21       MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
22       Dr. Ticknor applied the same criteria in
23 his analysis of Virginia Varner that he told
24 you he uses to teach medical students and young
25 residents how to diagnose addiction and treat persons with substance abuse problems.
2       He read all of the medical records, he
3 reviewed all of the deposition testimony in
4 this case before he arrived at his diagnosis
5 about Virginia Varner.
6       He provided you with medical criteria he
7 used to determine whether Mrs. Varner was
8 addicted.  He explained it all to you in great
9 detail on Friday.  He told you Virginia Varner
10 was not addicted to cigarettes.
11       He told you that addiction requires
12 something called "clinically significant
13 impairment," which simply stated means did the
14 person lose control in an important aspect of
15 their life because of the use of the substance?
16       He told you there was no evidence of
17 that, and you know that's the case.  Ms. Varner
18 never failed in her role as a mother or a wife.
19 She never let smoking interfere with any of her
20 duties or obligations.
21       Smoking didn't control Mrs. Varner.  To
22 the contrary, she controlled her smoking when
23 her husband quit in 1992 and when she quit cold
24 turkey in August of 1994.
25       So at the end of the day you have to ask yourself whether the plaintiff's evidence is
2 sufficient or whether something more should be
3 required like tangible, reliable evidence.
4       Based on the evidence you've heard, the
5 answer should be clear.  Mrs. Varner wasn't
6 some hopeless addict or some tortured smoker;
7 she was a hard-working, intelligent, and
8 capable person who made her own decisions in
9 life.
10       Your answer to the first question -- I'll
11 go back here -- oops.  The answer to the first
12 question should be "no."
13       But even, ladies and gentlemen, even if
14 you were to answer the first part of the
15 question "yes" and find that she is addicted,
16 your work is just beginning because the
17 plaintiff still has to prove the second part of
18 the question.
19       The plaintiff still bears the burden to
20 prove by the greater weight of the evidence
21 that Ms. Varner's claimed addiction was a legal
22 cause of her lung cancer and death or COPD.
23       Now the Court gave you an instruction for
24 legal cause, and the language of that
25 instruction can be a little bit hard to follow. So let me give you a thought to help you
2 explain this concept of legal cause.
3       Imagine, if you will, ladies and
4 gentlemen, someone walks across the street and
5 they get hit by a bus.  Well, the bus is the
6 medical cause of why they were injured.  But to
7 determine legal cause, you would need to know
8 more than that.
9       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
10       THE COURT:  Overruled.
11       MR. GERAGHTY:  You would need to know,
12 for example, did the person cross the street
13 when she had the right-of-way?  Was the light
14 green or red when she crossed the street?  Was
15 she paying attention or was she texting on her
16 phone or listening to music?
17       Did the person cross the street knowing
18 that that bus was going to be there every
19 single day?
20       Those are things you would need to know
21 in order to understand legal cause.
22       And the question of legal cause boils
23 down to quitting, quitting smoking and
24 motivation to quit smoking.
25       Ask yourself, based on the evidence you've heard, was Ms. Varner's claimed
2 addiction so strong, so substantial that it
3 prevented her from quitting when she was truly
4 motivated to do so?
5       The truth is and the evidence has shown
6 Ms. Varner was not motivated to quit smoking
7 before she was diagnosed with lung cancer in
8 1994.
9       If Ms. Varner did not make any effort to
10 quit smoking until then, ask yourselves how can
11 addiction be a legal cause of her cancer and
12 death?
13       What better evidence can there be that
14 she was not motivated to quit than the fact
15 that she made no real effort to do so until
16 after her cancer diagnosis?
17       Other than Lori Cohen, no one came into
18 this courtroom and told you that Mrs. Varner
19 ever tried to stop smoking before 1994.  How
20 can the plaintiff maintain that Ms. Varner's
21 so-called addiction prevented her from quitting
22 when she never really tried before July of
23 1994?
24       Rather, it was Ms. Varner's decision to
25 smoke cigarettes long after she knew the dangers and her decision not to make a
2 motivated effort to quit until 1994 that was
3 the one and only legal cause of her cancer and
4 death in this case.
5       Only the smoker can make the decision and
6 ultimately the effort to quit, even
7 Dr. DiFranza told you that.
8       This is his testimony.
9       And the choice to attempt to quit smoking
10 is 100 percent within the smoker's control,
11 correct?
12       Dr. DiFranza's answer is:  Yes.
13       The truth is and the evidence shows that
14 Mrs. Varner enjoyed smoking cigarettes.  That's
15 what she wanted to do.  And she was not really
16 interested in quitting until 1994, when she was
17 diagnosed with lung cancer.
18       Think about it for just a second.
19 Mr. Varner and his lawyers are trying to
20 persuade you that Mrs. Varner --
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
22       THE COURT:  Sustained.
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Move to strike.
24       THE COURT:  Jury disregard.
25       MR. GERAGHTY:  The plaintiff is trying to persuade you that Mrs. Varner really wanted to
2 quit.  She desperately wanted to quit.  But
3 what did she tell her own husband in 1992, when
4 he had his heart attack and he encouraged her
5 to quit?  This is what she told him, after 35
6 years of smoking cigarettes.
7       To answer this first question, all you
8 really need to do is listen to what
9 Dr. DiFranza told you.  Whether you're addicted
10 or not, Dr. DiFranza told you 60 million
11 Americans have quit smoking.  Most of those
12 60 million Americans would be considered
13 addicted according to his criteria.
14 Nevertheless, most of those people quit smoking
15 cold turkey, meaning without any assistance
16 whatsoever.
17       Just like Dr. Ticknor told you, the
18 nicotine in cigarettes did not prevent these
19 60 million people from understanding that
20 cigarette smoking is dangerous and from
21 exercising their free will to stop.
22       And during the past two weeks you've
23 heard no evidence that Virginia Varner was any
24 different.  She wasn't some hopeless addict who
25 lost her free will.  She was hard-working, intelligent, capable.  Her husband told you
2 that.
3       THE COURT:  Ten minutes, Counsel.
4       MR. GERAGHTY:  She received many warnings
5 over the years; and she smoked in the face of
6 those warnings, and she had every right to make
7 that choice.  But it was her informed decision
8 to smoke for many years that was the one and
9 only legal cause of her lung cancer and COPD.
10       So after hearing all the evidence, ladies
11 and gentlemen, your answer to this question
12 should be "no."  Your answer to this question
13 should be "no."
14       I'm going to zoom ahead now.
15       Okay.  I don't think you're going to get
16 this far on the verdict form, but --
17       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor,
18 personal belief of counsel, move to strike.
19       THE COURT:  Jury is to disregard the last
20 comments, sustained.
21       MR. GERAGHTY:  If you get past
22 question 1, question 2 is a question that
23 relates only to R.J. Reynolds.  I'm going to
24 let Mr. Keehfus talk about it.
25       I don't think -- well, let me just read question number 3.  It's a little bit wordy.
2 It says:  Please state as to each defendant
3 whether Virginia Varner reasonably relied to
4 her detriment on any statement made by that
5 defendant which concealed or omitted material
6 information not already known or available to
7 her concerning the health effects and/or
8 addictive nature of smoking cigarettes, and if
9 so, whether such reliance was a legal cause of
10 Virginia Varner's death.
11       I mean, that's a mouthful, right?
12       The fourth question is very similar
13 except it broadens it to include other
14 cigarette companies.
15       So here's what you need to focus on.
16 Instruction number 10 tells you what
17 "detrimental reliance" is.
18       The plaintiff must prove as to each
19 defendant that, but for Virginia Varner's
20 reliance on a statement by that defendant
21 concealing or omitting a material fact not
22 otherwise known or available, she would have
23 acted differently and avoided her injuries.
24       That's the instruction you'll have in the
25 packet from the Court. So what's the evidence that you heard?
2       You know what Mr. Varner told you about
3 this.  We asked him these questions
4 point-blank:  Your wife never told you that she
5 had ever saw or read or heard a statement about
6 cigarette smoking and health made by for
7 example, Philip Morris?
8       His answer was:  No.
9       He gave the same answer about
10 R.J. Reynolds.
11       I asked him about the Tobacco Institute,
12 the Council for Tobacco Research, the Tobacco
13 Industry Research Committee.  Said he had never
14 heard of those organizations, and he never had
15 a conversation with his wife about any
16 statements they ever made.
17       I even asked him point-blank:  Your wife
18 never told you that she relied upon any
19 statements made by any tobacco company?
20       She relied on it?  He asked me.
21       I said:  Yeah.
22       His answer was:  No.
23       That's his testimony under oath.
24       Now -- so what did the plaintiff tell
25 you?  You heard Lori Cohen tell you this story about how she and her mother were looking at a
2 coffee can filled with cigarette butts filled
3 with rain water, and that made them think that
4 filtered cigarettes were somehow safe because
5 they were taking out some of the, quote, "bad
6 stuff."
7       She went on to say that that's -- some of
8 that stuff's got to be going into your lungs.
9 And her mother said:  I don't know, I guess.
10       Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask that
11 you use your common sense when you evaluate
12 whether that testimony and that evidence is
13 remotely credible.  Does that story make sense?
14 Well, it certainly doesn't make any sense when
15 you consider what Lori Cohen admitted on
16 cross-examination.
17       This is what she admitted.
18       So the smoke from the cigarette passes
19 through the filter, goes into your lungs, and
20 that's what you were saying to your mother when
21 you said:  Hey, this brown gook or guck, or
22 whatever it is, is getting into your lungs?
23       Lori Cohen said:  Yes.
24       Then we asked her:  Isn't it true that
25 you don't remember whether your mother agreed or disagreed with what you told her about
2 filtered cigarettes?
3       She didn't -- she never -- she never
4 said.  And she agreed with that same question a
5 second time.  That's what Lori Cohen told you.
6       But more importantly, ladies and
7 gentlemen, just remember the sequence of
8 events.  At the time this conversation
9 allegedly took place in the early 1980s,
10 Gertrude Woodward had already been diagnosed
11 with emphysema from smoking filtered
12 cigarettes.
13       Virginia Varner had been smoking filtered
14 Marlboro cigarettes since the 1950s, her
15 doctors told her she had a smoker's cough and
16 wheeze from smoking filtered cigarettes.
17       She told Lori many times:  These
18 cigarettes are killing me.  Meaning "these
19 filtered cigarettes are killing me."
20       And finally, remember, every single pack
21 of cigarettes she and her husband smoked, these
22 filtered cigarettes, had the Surgeon General's
23 warning right on them.
24       "The Surgeon General has determined that
25 cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health." Ask yourself whether Lori Cohen's story
2 makes any sense.
3       In light of all the evidence you've
4 heard, it just doesn't add up.
5       Let me highlight one instruction real
6 briefly.  It's instruction number 16.  I didn't
7 put it up on the screen.  There we -- it's not
8 on the screen, but let me just -- it's
9 instruction number 16.
10       The Judge has already instructed you, but
11 take a look at it.  It says:  As long as
12 cigarette packs bear the federally mandated
13 warnings, cigarette advertising after July 1,
14 1969, cannot be the subject -- cannot be the
15 subject of any claim that the advertising
16 undermined or neutralized the warnings or made
17 them less effective.
18       You'll have the opportunity to read that
19 instruction when you go back.  When you go back
20 and read that instruction and you consider the
21 evidence that I've just reviewed on this
22 so-called story about filtered cigarettes,
23 you'll see that the plaintiff simply can't meet
24 his burden of proof that his wife relied on any
25 kind of statement made by any cigarette company.
2       Ladies and gentlemen, the bottom line is,
3 Virginia Varner never saw, heard, or read a
4 single statement made by Philip Morris,
5 R.J. Reynolds or any tobacco company.  But
6 that's what the plaintiff's burden is to prove
7 to you.
8       Your answer to question 3 and 4 should be
9 "no."
10       So let me quickly move on to question
11 number 5 and 6.
12       Again, I need to respond because
13 Mr. Schlesinger talked about it.  Question 5
14 is:  Was there fault on the part of Virginia
15 Varner which was a legal cause of her death?
16 And then you're asked to state the percentage.
17       So what does it mean to accept
18 responsibility for the decisions that one makes
19 in life?
20       The evidence you've heard is clear that
21 Virginia Varner knew smoking was dangerous and
22 addictive for many decades.  She never took any
23 steps to quit until July or August of 1994.
24       You heard Mr. Varner say that he believes
25 his wife -- oops, I screwed that up -- let me -- okay.  We may have taken that out.
2       Mr. Varner told you that he believed his
3 wife could have quit smoking if she had tried
4 earlier than 1994.  He told you that.  He told
5 you that.
6       So when you get to this issue of
7 responsibility, ask yourselves:  If someone
8 never makes any effort to quit at any point in
9 time until after they have lung cancer, who is
10 responsible for that decision?
11       Dr. DiFranza told you that the smoker is
12 100 percent responsible for the decision and
13 the choice to try to quit.  The answer to the
14 question ought to be simple, ladies and
15 gentlemen.  Virginia Varner is 100 percent
16 responsible.
17       Here's that testimony from her husband:
18 Do you think your wife had the ability to quit
19 smoking or at least try to quit before she did
20 in 1994?  And he agreed.
21       Now let me move on to the damages.  I
22 don't think you'll get this far on the verdict
23 form --
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
25       THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. GERAGHTY:  You heard Mr. Schlesinger
2 ask you to award a total of $10 million in
3 damages to Mr. Varner for the decisions that
4 Virginia Varner and only Virginia Varner made
5 to smoke cigarettes.  That is an incredible sum
6 of money.
7       Ask yourself how did the plaintiff come
8 up with that number?  That would be no
9 different than if I suggested $100,000.
10       The plaintiff has the burden of proof on
11 damages.  He has to burden to prove every
12 single dollar in damages that Mr. Schlesinger
13 asked for, and he has to burden to prove that
14 with evidence, not argument.
15       Judge Murphy has already instructed you
16 that's the law.
17       Is there any evidence to support the
18 plaintiff's number?  Of course not.  That
19 number, ladies and gentlemen, was essentially
20 pulled out of thin air.
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
22       THE COURT:  Sustained.
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Move to strike.
24       THE COURT:  Jurors disregard the last
25 comment. MR. GERAGHTY:  The arguments of the
2 lawyers are not evidence.  There needs to be
3 evidence to support every single dollar in
4 damages.
5       So where is the evidence to justify such
6 a huge amount based on what you heard during
7 this trial?  Knowing the plaintiff has the
8 burden of proof?
9       You haven't heard any.  How do you even
10 get to $1 million, let alone $10 million?
11       In a case like this, that number defies
12 common sense.  We're talking about a case in
13 which every pack of cigarettes Virginia Varner
14 smoked had a government-mandated warning since
15 1966, that she and her husband discussed when
16 they first came out in 1966.
17       Smoking was something that Virginia and
18 Joseph Varner wanted to do, that they enjoyed
19 doing together.
20       Mr. Varner never once encouraged his wife
21 to quit smoking before 1992, yet here he is
22 asking you to award him an incredible sum of
23 money.
24       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
25       THE COURT:  What is the objection? MR. SCHLESINGER:  May I approach?
2       (The following discussion was held at
3       sidebar:)
4       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm sorry, Judge, what
5 does the warning --
6       THE COURT:  "Incredible"?  I take it
7 that's the problem?
8       MR. SCHLESINGER:  What does the warning
9 have to do with damages?  The warnings have to
10 do with the damages?  You talk about the
11 damages in the case, the warnings have to --
12       Yeah, I object to him saying it's an
13 incredible amount of money, and I object to him
14 saying that the warnings have something to do
15 with the damages in the case.
16       And I'm not looking to interrupt his
17 time.  I apologize.  But I don't want to make
18 a --
19       THE COURT:  Wish to be heard?
20       MR. GERAGHTY:  No, Your Honor.
21       THE COURT:  The objection is overruled.
22 This is argument.
23       Counsel, you need to start to wrap it up.
24       MR. GERAGHTY:  Mr. Keehfus said I have
25 five minutes of his time. (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
2       following was held in open court:)
3       THE COURT:  Counsel, when you're ready,
4 you may proceed.
5       MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
6       In 1992, you heard that for the very
7 first time, Joseph Varner encouraged his wife
8 to stop smoking.
9       What does she say?  I'm going to die
10 anyway.
11       That's in 1992.  Virginia Varner never
12 made any effort to quit smoking before she was
13 diagnosed with cancer.
14       Should Joseph Varner be made a
15 multimillionaire when the evidence shows that
16 he and his wife lived their lives exactly the
17 way they wanted to live it?
18       And if you get this far on the verdict
19 form, I would suggest that you use your life
20 experiences and your common sense when
21 deciding --
22       MR. GDANSKI:  Objection.
23       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Object.  Golden rule,
24 Judge.
25       THE COURT:  Overruled. MR. GERAGHTY:  I suggest you use your
2 everyday life experiences and your common sense
3 when deciding how much money you believe should
4 compensate Mr. Varner for his loss.
5       But I would suggest that given the
6 evidence that you've heard in this case over
7 the last two weeks, $100,000 is indeed far more
8 consistent, fair and appropriate, given all the
9 evidence you've heard in the case.
10       Now, the last question on the verdict
11 form asks whether you find by clear and
12 convincing evidence that punitive damages are
13 warranted against Philip Morris or
14 R.J. Reynolds.
15       If you answer "no" to that question, you
16 never get to the issue of punitive damages and
17 your work is done.
18       So let me very briefly talk about what
19 you're being asked to decide.
20       In this phase, you are not being asked to
21 decide the amount of punitive damages.  The
22 issue is whether, by clear and convincing
23 evidence, Mr. Varner has demonstrated that he
24 is entitled to an award of punitive damages.
25       So don't spend one minute thinking about the amount.
2       The question before you right now is
3 whether he has shown that he's entitled to
4 punitive damages.
5       If you decide the answer to that question
6 is "yes," there will be another phase of this
7 trial.  The plaintiff will present evidence.
8 They suggested they may show testimony from
9 Dr. Proctor --
10       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
11       MR. GERAGHTY:  Philip Morris --
12       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.  What we're
13 doing in the second phase, objection.
14       THE COURT:  Sustained, Counsel.
15       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Move to strike.
16       MR. GERAGHTY:  Plaintiff will have the
17 opportunity to present evidence.  Philip Morris
18 and R.J. Reynolds will have the opportunity to
19 present evidence, and there will be additional
20 argument.
21       Now, I want to make sure that if you get
22 to this issue, you understand what you're being
23 asked to decide.
24       You will see in the instructions clear
25 and convincing evidence is defined.  It's a much higher burden of proof than the greater
2 weight of the evidence.
3       It says specifically that the evidence
4 must be, quote, "precise, explicit, lacking in
5 confusion, and of such weight that it produces
6 a firm belief or conviction without hesitation
7 about the matter at issue."
8       In other words, you need to be convinced,
9 convinced that punitive damages are appropriate
10 under that standard.
11       One more thing.  You have to decide if
12 you get there that punitive damages are
13 warranted based only on conduct that relates
14 specifically to Virginia Varner.
15       You may think to yourselves --
16       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.
17       THE COURT:  Overruled.
18       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.
19       THE COURT:  Excuse me.
20       What is the objection, Counsel?
21       MR. SCHLESINGER:  May I approach?  I'm
22 sorry.
23       (The following discussion was held at
24       sidebar:)
25       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Damages to be awarded in the next phase pertain only to the conduct
2 as it affects Virginia Varner.
3       However, Your Honor read an instruction
4 that says:  In assessing reprehensibility and
5 determining whether punitive damages are
6 warranted, you may consider harm to others.
7 And you may do it for purposes of deterring
8 others from acting the same way.
9       He just said the only way you get to
10 punitive damages is, any wrongful conduct
11 specific as to Virginia Varner.  That's not
12 your instruction.  That's Phase II.  That has
13 to go with how much the damages will be to her,
14 if they get there.
15       But that is absolutely not the
16 instruction you gave on why you admitted into
17 evidence the harm to others.
18       So it's a complete misstatement of law.
19 I had to object.
20       THE COURT:  Wish to be heard?
21       MR. GERAGHTY:  No, sir.
22       THE COURT:  Overruled.
23       (Sidebar discussion concluded, and the
24       following was held in open court:)
25       MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm getting close to the finish line here, ladies and gentlemen.
2       May I proceed, Your Honor?
3       THE COURT:  Please.
4       MR. GERAGHTY:  Now, you may think, based
5 on the evidence you've heard, well, the
6 companies did bad things, and I'm sure you
7 don't like that.
8       But this is Virginia Varner's case, and
9 under the law, you cannot award punitive
10 damages unless -- you can only award punitive
11 damages in this case for conduct that's
12 specifically related to Virginia Varner.
13       Based on the evidence you've heard in
14 this case, nothing that Philip Morris did or
15 did not do harmed Virginia Varner.
16       Philip Morris made and sold cigarettes.
17 That alone cannot be the basis for liability.
18       Cigarettes are a legal product.  And in
19 the instructions, the Court has already
20 instructed you the defendants cannot be liable
21 for manufacturing, advertising, and selling
22 cigarettes, even though we all recognize they
23 are inherently dangerous and addictive.
24       Now, let's talk about that last factor,
25 deterrence. What did you hear about the Philip Morris
2 of today from Dr. Proctor?  You heard that the
3 Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco
4 Research were disbanded in 1998.
5       Since that time, there have been no
6 cigarette ads on billboards or transit of any
7 kind.  There's no sponsorship of concerts, no
8 advertising at sporting events.
9       And you've also heard that even though
10 it's legally permissible today, Philip Morris
11 no longer advertises in magazines.
12       For the last 16 years, Philip Morris has
13 publicly stated cigarette smoking causes lung
14 cancer, cigarette smoking is addictive, and
15 there is no such thing as a safe cigarette.
16       The FDA now has regulatory authority over
17 Philip Morris and cigarettes.  Philip Morris
18 pays large sums of money to the FDA and the
19 states, including the state of Florida, to
20 enforce the regulations and the restrictions
21 that govern the way Philip Morris does business
22 today.
23       And what are those restrictions?  The FDA
24 has the power to reduce nicotine to arbitrarily
25 very, very low levels.  It has the power to ban any flavoring it deems unsafe or harmful.
2       Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds have to
3 get approval from the FDA if they want to
4 launch a new tobacco product or make any
5 substantial change in an existing one.
6       The FDA has the power to shut down
7 manufacturing facilities if Philip Morris and
8 R.J. Reynolds are not in compliance with any of
9 the FDA's regulations.
10       Smoking rates for both adults and youth
11 are at all-time lows in this country, and
12 that's especially true here in the state of
13 Florida.
14       Ms. Varner always had the information
15 available to her to make an informed decision
16 about whether she would smoke cigarettes or
17 whether she wanted to quit.
18       She always had the ability to quit
19 whenever she was motivated to do so.
20       And the evidence now shows that she
21 simply did not make an effort to do so until,
22 unfortunately, it was too late.
23       Given the evidence you've heard, the
24 plaintiff has simply failed to meet his burden
25 of proof on this question, and your answer to that last question on punitive damages should
2 be "no."
3       I'm going to sit down here in about 60
4 seconds.  Mr. Keehfus is going to speak to you,
5 and then Mr. Schlesinger, on behalf of the
6 plaintiff, will have one more opportunity to
7 talk to you, and that's because the plaintiff
8 bears the burden of proof.
9       I don't know what Mr. Schlesinger will
10 say, but I can predict it's likely not going to
11 be very favorable about Philip Morris and
12 R.J. Reynolds.
13       As you listen to the things he says, just
14 ask yourself:  What does this have to do with
15 Virginia Varner?
16       MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.
17 That's --
18       THE COURT:  Excuse me.
19       It's argument, Counsel.
20       MR. SCHLESINGER:  I withdraw it, Judge.
21 I withdraw it.
22       MR. GERAGHTY:  The truth is, ladies and
23 gentlemen, we do enjoy a tremendous amount of
24 freedom in this country.  We have the right to
25 make decisions and lifestyle choices that are not always in our best interests.  And with
2 that freedom comes the obligation to accept
3 personal responsibility for the consequences of
4 those decisions.
5       And at the end of the day, ladies and
6 gentlemen, that's what this case is all about.
7       That's what this case is all about.
8       Based on the evidence you've heard in
9 this case, your answer should be clear.
10       Based on the evidence you've heard in
11 Virginia Varner's case, the evidence supports
12 one and only one true verdict.  That's a
13 verdict in favor of Philip Morris and
14 R.J. Reynolds.
15       I'm going to sit down now, and this is my
16 last opportunity I'm going to have to speak to
17 all of you.
18       And I just want to end with letting you
19 know that it's been an honor to be able to
20 present the case to you.  You have all been
21 very, very patient with all the questions I've
22 asked and all the time I've spent standing up
23 talking to you, and I just want you to know
24 that I really appreciate it very much.
25       So thank you very much. THE COURT:  Counsel, thank you.



14       MR. KEEHFUS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
15       May it please the Court.
16       Counsel.  Mr. Varner.
17       Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.
18       JURORS:  Good afternoon.
19       MR. KEEHFUS:  This case is about one
20 smoker and one smoker only.
21       It's about Mrs. Varner.  And it's about
22 Mrs. Varner who smoked my client's product over
23 the course of two years 60 years ago.
24       And she stopped smoking my client's
25 product nearly four decades before she was diagnosed with lung cancer or COPD.
2       Those are the facts of this case, of
3 Mrs. Varner's case.
4       Now, plaintiff has made the claim to you
5 that somehow Mrs. Varner's smoking of Winston
6 cigarettes over the course of those two years
7 in the 1950s caused her lung cancer and COPD 40
8 years later.
9       There has been a complete failure of
10 proof.  Plaintiffs have completely failed to
11 meet their burden of proof to prove to you that
12 but for Mrs. Varner's smoking of Winston
13 cigarettes for those two years in the 1950s,
14 she would have avoided her lung cancer and
15 COPD.
16       What was the evidence that you did hear
17 with respect to R.J. Reynolds?
18       I've summarized it here on this board.
19 These are five key facts.  Five key facts that
20 you heard through this trial, and you can use
21 each of these five key facts to answer every
22 question on the verdict form with respect to
23 R.J. Reynolds.
24       This can be your pocket guide as you go
25 back into the jury room. What are those key facts?  Mrs. Varner's
2 smoking of Reynolds' cigarettes for only two
3 years did not cause her cancer, COPD, or death.
4       Mrs. Varner regularly smoked Reynolds'
5 cigarettes for only two years and stopped
6 smoking Winston cigarettes in 1956.
7       Mrs. Varner never tried to quit smoking
8 while she smoked Reynolds' cigarettes.
9       Mrs. Varner never relied on anything
10 R.J. Reynolds said or did.  Instead, she made
11 her own smoking decisions.
12       And despite knowing that smoking is
13 dangerous and addictive, Mrs. Varner chose to
14 smoke, because she wanted to smoke.
15       These are the five key facts that you can
16 use to answer each and every question on your
17 verdict form with respect to R.J. Reynolds.
18       And during the time I have with you, I
19 want to focus in on the issues with respect to
20 R.J. Reynolds, the specific issues with respect
21 to my client.
22       I, of course, join in Mr. Geraghty's
23 comments to you this morning and this
24 afternoon.  And I'm going to focus in on just
25 some of the questions on the verdict form specifically with respect to R.J. Reynolds.
2       Undisputed, ladies and gentlemen,
3 Mrs. Varner smoked Winston cigarettes only over
4 the course of two years, between 1954 and 1956.
5       Now, we don't know how much she was
6 smoking of Winston at that time.  It was so
7 long ago, Mr. Varner couldn't provide those
8 details.  We don't know how much she was
9 smoking of Winston.  We don't know how often
10 she was smoking.
11       But what we do know is that she was in
12 school at the time, all day long, and smoking
13 was not permitted on school grounds.  And then
14 after school, we know that she went home to
15 live with her parents.
16       So while we don't know exactly how much
17 Mrs. Varner was smoking between 1954 and 1956,
18 we know it probably wasn't that much, because
19 she just didn't have an opportunity to smoke at
20 that time.
21       We also know that around this time, she's
22 also smoking some Marlboro cigarettes.  You
23 recall that Mr. Varner got a Marlboro cigarette
24 from Mrs. Varner around this time period.
25       You heard this morning from plaintiff that, well, was it 1953 when she started
2 smoking Winston or was it 1954?
3       But you heard Dr. Proctor tell you,
4 Winston didn't even come on the market in the
5 United States until 1954.  There's absolutely
6 no way she was smoking any Winston cigarettes
7 before 1954.
8       And the undisputed evidence is she
9 stopped in 1956.
10       We also -- what else do we know about
11 Mrs. Varner's smoking of Winston?
12       Well, Mr. Varner told you, they didn't
13 like the taste of Winston.  It was too harsh.
14 They didn't enjoy that taste, and so they
15 switched.
16       They switched to a cigarette that they
17 did enjoy and they did like the taste of,
18 Marlboro.
19       And by the time they were dating in 1957,
20 they were smoking Marlboro cigarettes.
21       And the undisputed testimony before you
22 is that Mrs. Varner smoked Marlboro cigarettes
23 from 1957 to 1994.
24       Mr. Varner told you that, Lisa Roberts
25 told you that, and her daughter Lori Cohen told you that.  No dispute about that.
2       There's no evidence that Mrs. Varner
3 smoked Winston or any other cigarette
4 manufactured by my client after 1956, 60 years
5 ago.
6       R.J. Reynolds was out of her life in
7 1956, never to return.
8       Now, I told you in opening statement you
9 probably wouldn't hear much about Winston
10 cigarettes in this trial, and you didn't.
11       And that's because Mrs. Varner's use of
12 Winston cigarettes was so long ago and it was
13 so minimal and insignificant that it didn't
14 merit much discussion, and you didn't hear much
15 about it.
16       And in thinking of a way to illustrate
17 Mrs. Varner's use of Winston cigarettes in the
18 context of all of her smoking, I tried to come
19 up with a picture.
20       I think this is a helpful way to
21 demonstrate Mrs. Varner's use of Winston
22 cigarettes in the context of all of her
23 smoking.
24       It was like a couple of drops of water in
25 an ocean.  Very insignificant.  Very minimal, her use of Winston.
2       Now, plaintiff's other claim that they
3 have made against R.J. Reynolds are for
4 concealment and agreement to conceal, questions
5 3 and questions 4 on your verdict form.
6       As Mr. Geraghty told you, it's
7 plaintiff's burden of proof -- not burden of
8 speculation, not a burden of assumptions, and
9 not a burden of inferences, but it's their
10 burden of proof -- to bring you evidence that
11 Mrs. Varner relied on a statement made by
12 R.J. Reynolds or Philip Morris.
13       And but for her reliance on that
14 statement, she would have acted differently and
15 avoided her injuries.
16       We will talk more about that later, but
17 there's a complete lack of evidence with
18 respect to R.J. Reynolds on both the
19 concealment and agreement to conceal claims.
20       In fact, there's no evidence that
21 Mrs. Varner had even heard of R.J. Reynolds,
22 Mr. Varner, and their three children testified.
23 Not a single one of them even said the name
24 "R.J. Reynolds" in their testimony.
25       It's an extremely high burden of proof. The plaintiff has to prove that but for her
2 reliance, she would have acted differently and
3 avoided her lung cancer and COPD.  And they
4 failed to meet that burden of proof.
5       But I want to focus in on the key issue
6 with respect to R.J. Reynolds.  It's going to
7 be question 2 on your verdict form.
8       If you get to question 2.  Because,
9 again, I join in Mr. Geraghty's comments and
10 ask that you return a verdict for the
11 defendants on question 1, which would be a no.
12       If you get to question 2, the plaintiff
13 must prove that smoking R.J. Reynolds'
14 cigarettes was a legal cause of Mrs. Varner's
15 lung cancer and COPD.
16       Now, as Mr. Geraghty told you in opening
17 statement, there is no dispute in this case
18 that smoking was a legal cause of Mrs. Varner's
19 lung cancer and COPD.
20       The question for you is whether it was
21 R.J. Reynolds,' whether smoking R.J. Reynolds'
22 cigarettes was a legal cause of Mrs. Varner's
23 lung cancer or COPD.
24       The plaintiff has a burden to prove that
25 against R.J. Reynolds.  You will see that on question 2 on your verdict form.
2       Question 2:  Was smoking cigarettes
3 manufactured by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company a
4 legal cause of Virginia Varner's lung cancer or
5 COPD?
6       Now, this morning it was suggested to you
7 that R.J. Reynolds was a substantial cause of
8 Mrs. Varner's lung cancer or COPD because those
9 two years of Winston back in the 1950s
10 initiated and sustained an addiction.  Those
11 were the words that were used.
12       Ladies and gentlemen, on this question --
13       Can I have the Elmo, please?  Oh, boy.
14 There we go.
15       So it was suggested to you that
16 R.J. Reynolds' cigarettes were a substantial
17 cause of Mrs. Varner's lung cancer and COPD
18 because they initiated and sustained an
19 addiction.  And we'll get to that in more
20 detail later.
21       But you can see in question 2, addiction
22 appears nowhere in that question.  Addiction
23 has nothing to do with question 2.
24       The question is very limited and very
25 focused.  And it boils down to:  Did Mrs. Varner smoke enough Winston cigarettes to
2 be a cause of her lung cancer or COPD 40 years
3 later?
4       Addiction has nothing to do with
5 question 2.
6       We talked about this concept of legal
7 cause.  I spoke to you about it briefly during
8 opening statement.
9       What does it mean to be a legal cause?
10       You have your jury instruction.  It's
11 jury instruction number 9, and it's on page 11
12 of your packet.
13       And, ladies and gentlemen, this legal
14 instruction embodies the rules of law that you
15 have to apply to the facts as you find them to
16 render your verdict.
17       These are the rules.  And these are the
18 rules that you apply.
19       And what do the rules tell you?  Well,
20 the rules tell you the plaintiff must prove,
21 but for smoking -- but for smoking cigarettes
22 manufactured by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
23 Mrs. Varner's lung cancer or COPD would not
24 have occurred.
25       That's the plaintiff's burden.  They have to prove that but for smoking cigarettes
2 manufactured by R.J. Reynolds, Mrs. Varner's
3 lung cancer or COPD would not have occurred.
4       In other words, plaintiff has to prove
5 that if you take Winston out of the equation
6 from 1954 to 1956, Mrs. Varner never develops
7 lung cancer or COPD in 1994, nearly 40 years
8 later.  That's the burden of proof that
9 plaintiff has.
10       Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence was
11 overwhelming before you.  Not only did
12 plaintiff fail to meet their burden to prove to
13 you that Reynolds was a but-for cause of
14 Mrs. Varner's lung cancer or COPD.  But I
15 brought you the evidence on cross-examination
16 of their own expert witnesses that conclusively
17 established that Reynolds' cigarettes were not
18 a legal cause of Mrs. Varner's lung cancer or
19 COPD.
20       The evidence was overwhelming that two
21 pack years of smoking in the 1950s was not even
22 close to being enough to cause lung cancer or
23 COPD.
24       And it came from their own witnesses.
25 Dr. Gup.  You recall Dr. Gup was the gentleman that testified early last week.
2       And he told you on cross-examination:
3 Lung cancer typically does not occur without at
4 least 20 pack years of smoking, 20.  Ten times
5 the amount of Winston smoking that Mrs. Varner
6 had.
7       Dr. DiFranza went further.  He doubled
8 that.  He said in his 30 years of practicing
9 medicine up in Massachusetts, he's never seen a
10 lung cancer patient with less than 40 pack
11 years of smoking.  Forty pack years, 20 times
12 the amount of Winston smoking Mrs. Varner had.
13       And Dr. Proctor told you it takes decades
14 for cancer to develop.  And, of course, it
15 does.
16       Dr. Gup explained that.  He explained the
17 repeated exposures that are necessary over
18 many, many years in order for those genetic
19 mutations to even start the process which may
20 eventually end up being cancer.
21       It takes many, many years for those
22 mutations to even start.
23       Even in plaintiff's best case scenario,
24 their own witness said it takes at least 20
25 years.  Mrs. Varner had 1/10 of that.  1/10 of that for R.J. Reynolds.
2       Given what plaintiff's own expert said,
3 it wasn't surprising that Dr. DiFranza gave the
4 key admission on this issue, on the issue in
5 question 2 on your verdict form with respect to
6 R.J. Reynolds and legal cause.
7       Dr. DiFranza told you that even if
8 Mrs. Varner had started smoking in 1957,
9 instead of 1954, she more likely than not still
10 would have developed lung cancer.
11       You may ask yourself, well, why is that
12 important?  It's important because by 1957,
13 Winston and R.J. Reynolds are out of
14 Mrs. Varner's life.  She's a Marlboro smoker.
15       And Dr. DiFranza told you that if you
16 take out 1954 to 1956, remove that from the
17 equation, Mrs. Varner never touches Winston
18 cigarettes and starts smoking in 1957, she
19 still would have gotten lung cancer.
20       Remember, it's the plaintiff's burden to
21 prove if not for Winston, she never would have
22 gotten lung cancer or COPD.
23       Dr. DiFranza says that is not so.  The
24 same thing more likely than not would have
25 happened.  And that means R.J. Reynolds is not a legal cause.  The smoking of R.J. Reynolds'
2 cigarettes is not a legal cause of
3 Mrs. Varner's lung cancer or COPD.
4       But we didn't stop there.  Dr. DiFranza
5 admitted for someone with a smoking history of
6 just two or three pack years, he said that
7 person's risk of developing lung cancer would
8 be very, very low.  Very, very low.  Two pack
9 years, just like Mrs. Varner had with respect
10 to Winston.
11       And he said the person who had two or
12 three pack years would have a risk so low that
13 it would be difficult to distinguish from that
14 of a nonsmoker.
15       So even after two years of smoking
16 Winston, she really had no appreciable increase
17 in lung cancer risk compared to a nonsmoker.
18       So not only did plaintiff fail to prove
19 legal cause, but they couldn't even prove that
20 Winston increased the risk that Mrs. Varner
21 would get lung cancer or COPD, that it would
22 increase her chances, because Dr. DiFranza
23 said:  Even two years of smoking, no real
24 appreciable increase in risk.  And I can't tell
25 the difference in risk between someone who smokes for two years and a nonsmoker.
2       Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence was
3 overwhelming and direct and it came from
4 plaintiff's own witnesses, the witnesses they
5 hired to come in and testify on Mr. Varner's
6 behalf.
7       And they told you, they told you about
8 the amount of smoking that's required.
9 Multipliers more than two pack years.  For
10 Dr. Gup it was ten times that, and for
11 Dr. DiFranza it was 20 times that.  It wasn't
12 even close.
13       Mrs. Varner did not develop cancer in
14 1994 because she smoked cigarettes manufactured
15 by Reynolds over the course of a couple years
16 in the middle 1950s.
17       But plaintiffs have also made a claim for
18 COPD.  So what was the evidence on COPD?  Well,
19 it was even stronger than the evidence was for
20 cancer.  Dr. DiFranza told you he doesn't see
21 COPD patients with less than 50 pack years of
22 smoking, 25 times that of Mrs. Varner and
23 Winston smoking.
24       THE COURT:  Ten minutes, Counsel.
25       MR. KEEHFUS:  Dr. DiFranza admitted Mrs. Varner would have gotten COPD even if she
2 had never touched Winston cigarettes.  Even if
3 she had started smoking in 1957 when she
4 switched to Marlboro and smoked to 1994, she
5 still would have developed COPD.
6       That destroys plaintiff's claims of
7 but-for causation.
8       Remember, plaintiff has to prove if not
9 for the Winston, she doesn't develop lung
10 cancer or COPD.  Dr. DiFranza said on both
11 claims, on lung cancer and COPD, even if she
12 didn't smoke from 1954 to 1956, she still more
13 likely than not would have developed both of
14 those diseases.
15       That is the key admission in the case,
16 and that's the key admission on question 2, on
17 your verdict form, that smoking cigarettes
18 manufactured by Reynolds was not a legal cause.
19 Because Dr. DiFranza said so.
20       Now, the claim again was made to you that
21 her smoking of Winston during that time
22 initiated and sustained her addiction.  And
23 somehow her smoking of Winston over the course
24 of those two years made her go on and smoke
25 cigarettes manufactured by a different company for the next 40 years?
2       Well, ladies and gentlemen, you can use
3 your common sense to evaluate that argument and
4 that claim.  And when you do, you will see that
5 it just doesn't stand up to an examination.
6       What do we know?  Well, we know from that
7 time period when she's smoking Winston that
8 she's also smoking some Marlboro.  So you can't
9 say that if it wasn't for the Winston she would
10 not have gone on to become a regular smoker.
11 We know that she was smoking cigarettes
12 manufactured by other companies at that time
13 and cigarettes that she went on to smoke after
14 she switched from Winston.
15       Also, we know that Mr. Varner smoked
16 Marlboro pretty much his entire adult life.
17 That's how they identified themselves, as
18 Marlboro smokers.  And that was the man who she
19 married and spent time with.
20       He can't say that she wouldn't have gone
21 on to become a regular smoker if it wasn't for
22 Winston.  That's like someone who drinks red
23 wine for a couple of years early in their life
24 and then after a couple years says:  You know
25 what?  I don't like that red wine so much anymore, I don't like the taste of it and I'm
2 going to switch to white wine.  And they go on,
3 they drink white wine for the next 40 years
4 until they unfortunately develop cirrhosis of
5 the liver, and then they turn around and say:
6 Oh, but you know what?  It was that red wine
7 that I drank in an undetermined amount 40 years
8 ago that caused all the problems.
9       Of course nobody would say that because
10 it doesn't make sense.
11       Plaintiff's claim here is no different.
12       So, ladies and gentlemen, when you get to
13 question 2 and you see the question:  Was
14 smoking cigarettes manufactured by
15 R.J. Reynolds a legal cause of Mrs. Varner's
16 lung cancer or COPD, the answer is a resounding
17 "no."
18       There's been a complete failure of proof.
19 And, in fact, I've brought you the evidence to
20 demonstrate conclusively that Reynolds
21 cigarettes were not a legal cause.
22       But even if, in an alternate universe,
23 two years of smoking was somehow enough to
24 cause lung cancer or COPD, even if that was
25 enough, it happened so long ago that any minuscule risk that Mrs. Varner would have
2 accumulated would have disappeared.
3       That was the testimony from plaintiff's
4 expert Dr. Joseph DiFranza.  He candidly
5 admitted that for someone with a two- or
6 three-pack year history their risk of
7 developing lung cancer 40 years later would be
8 the same as someone who had never smoked.
9       The risk would be the same as someone who
10 had never smoked.  No appreciable even increase
11 in the risk.  And after 40 years that risk
12 would decline and be the same as a never
13 smoker.
14       What did Dr. DiFranza tell you about this
15 addiction theory that Winston initiated and
16 sustained addiction?
17       He admitted that even if Mrs. Varner
18 didn't smoke Winston cigarettes from 1954 to
19 1956, knowing what he knows about the rest of
20 her smoking history from 1957 forward, he would
21 still come to the conclusion that she was
22 addicted.
23       Now, for the reasons Mr. Geraghty said
24 and discussed earlier, obviously plaintiffs
25 have failed to meet their burden of proof to prove Mrs. Varner was addicted to nicotine.
2       But even if they somehow could make that
3 case to you, Dr. DiFranza admits that even if
4 you -- even if she never touched Winston
5 cigarettes, in his opinion she still would have
6 been addicted.  So this theory that if not for
7 Winston she never would have been a regular
8 smoker, it just doesn't have any merit.
9       When you take it apart piece by piece, it
10 falls flat.
11       THE COURT:  Five minutes, Counsel.
12       MR. KEEHFUS:  So when you get to
13 question 2 on your verdict form, for all of
14 these reasons, the overwhelming and persuasive
15 and convincing evidence is Mrs. Varner's lung
16 cancer or COPD were not legally caused by her
17 smoking a couple of years of Winston cigarettes
18 40 years before she was diagnosed.
19       I want to get to plaintiff's claims for
20 reliance and concealment.
21       It's plaintiff's burden to prove the
22 linkage, the connection between any statements
23 and Mrs. Varner.  They've identified no
24 statement made by R.J. Reynolds that had any
25 impact whatsoever on Mrs. Varner. Again, this is a burden of proof.
2 They've got to provide you with a statement
3 that Mrs. Varner saw that impacted her smoking
4 decisions.  And there's been a total failure of
5 proof.
6       They've got to show a statement by each
7 defendant that she believed it, that she made
8 decisions based on it, and that had she not
9 seen it, she would have acted differently and
10 avoided her injury.
11       What does that mean?  That means that had
12 she -- they've got to prove, had she not seen
13 that statement, she wouldn't have gotten lung
14 cancer or COPD.  She would have thrown her
15 cigarettes down immediately, quit smoking, and
16 avoided any disease.
17       That's plaintiff's burden of proof when
18 you get to questions 3 and 4.  And they've
19 completely failed to prove that.
20       The fact is, there's absolutely no
21 evidence Mrs. Varner's smoking choices were
22 impacted by R.J. Reynolds.  There's no evidence
23 that she relied on any R.J. Reynolds
24 advertisements or ad campaigns or documents or
25 executives or video clips.  None of that. It was plaintiff's burden to tie all that
2 to Mrs. Varner.  Dr. Proctor testified for 14
3 hours and 43 minutes of your time.  He talked
4 about Mrs. Varner for less than 40 seconds.
5       He was no help to you in determining
6 whether Mrs. Varner was specifically impacted
7 by something Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds
8 did.
9       You have -- plaintiffs have a burden
10 against each defendant, and when you get to
11 question 3 or 4 -- 3 and 4, I ask that you find
12 "no" for Philip Morris but specifically for
13 R.J. Reynolds as well.
14       When you get to the issue of comparative
15 fault, plaintiffs have the burden to prove each
16 and every percentage point.
17       You shouldn't get this far on the verdict
18 form, but if you do, I want to address this
19 with you very briefly.
20       They have the burden to prove each and
21 every percentage point.  And it's got to be
22 conduct that you would find to be a legal cause
23 of Mrs. Varner's injuries.
24       This isn't a comparison of conduct in
25 general.  It's a very specific, focused question.  You can only allocate fault for that
2 conduct that you find to be a legal cause of
3 Mrs. Varner's injury, that conduct that they
4 tied up to Mrs. Varner.
5       And especially here with respect to
6 R.J. Reynolds, the evidence establishes that
7 her smoking of R.J. Reynolds cigarettes was not
8 a legal cause of her injury.  And even her
9 smoking of R.J. Reynolds products resulted in a
10 0 percent increase in even her chances or her
11 risk of developing a disease.
12       So I ask that if you get to this question
13 on your verdict form on the allocation of
14 fault, that you enter a 0 percent for
15 R.J. Reynolds.  R.J. Reynolds was out of her
16 life in 1956, never to return.
17       THE COURT:  You need to wrap it up,
18 Counsel.
19       MR. KEEHFUS:  Ladies and gentlemen, on
20 plaintiff's claim for damages, $10 million was
21 the claim made to you.  Plaintiff is asking
22 from R.J. Reynolds for millions of dollars
23 because Mrs. Varner took some Winston
24 cigarettes from her mother and smoked them over
25 the course of a couple of years 60 years ago. And for that Mr. Varner wants to be made a
2 millionaire.
3       Respectfully, ladies and gentlemen, the
4 evidence does not even come close to supporting
5 that claim especially against R.J. Reynolds.
6       On the issue of punitive damages, you'll
7 be told that -- and in your instructions you
8 were instructed that there's mitigating
9 evidence.
10       You may consider mitigating evidence
11 which demonstrates that R.J. Reynolds and
12 Philip Morris need not be punished.
13       And what did you hear?  You heard
14 R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris tried to make a
15 safer cigarette.  Specifically R.J. Reynolds
16 tried with the Premier cigarette which heated,
17 did not burn tobacco.  But it failed in the
18 marketplace because it smelled like rotten
19 rubber and fish, as Dr. Proctor told you.
20       But that doesn't stop them.  They didn't
21 give up.  Reynolds went back to the drawing
22 board and tried Eclipse, redoubled their
23 efforts, poured hundreds of millions of dollars
24 into it.  But it failed again in the
25 marketplace.  But they tried to make a safer product.
2       You heard now about public disclosure on
3 the companies' websites.  You heard about the
4 companies funding tobacco-free Florida, the
5 anti-youth smoking programs that are currently
6 in place, and the fact that we have evidence
7 that they're working.
8       Youth smoking rates are at an all-time
9 low, especially in Broward County.
10       You heard a lot about the environment of
11 smoking, but you heard that smoking has now
12 been de-normalized and we are moving towards a
13 society where nobody will smoke cigarettes.
14 That is the environment that Dr. Proctor told
15 you about today.
16       That is the mitigating evidence, ladies
17 and gentlemen, which you should consider on
18 this issue of whether the plaintiff is entitled
19 to punitive damages.
20       And when you get to question 8, you
21 should check "no" for both defendants, but
22 especially for R.J. Reynolds in light of the
23 evidence that you heard in this trial.
24       I'm going to end where I started, with
25 these five key facts, five key facts that you heard and will help you decide every question
2 with respect to R.J. Reynolds on your verdict
3 form.
4       I told you my role in this case would be
5 limited.  I didn't cross-examine some of the
6 witnesses, and other witnesses I cross-examined
7 very briefly.  But I told you my role was going
8 to be limited because of Mrs. Varner's limited
9 use of my client's product.
10       And that's exactly what the evidence
11 showed.
12       She smoked my client's product very
13 minimally for an insignificant period of time
14 60 years ago.  And the evidence showed that her
15 smoking of R.J. Reynolds cigarettes was not a
16 legal cause of her lung cancer or COPD 60 --
17 sorry, 40 years later and 60 years ago.
18       Ladies and gentlemen, I ask that you
19 return a verdict in favor of the defendants in
20 this case.
21       I thank you very much for your time and
22 attention.
