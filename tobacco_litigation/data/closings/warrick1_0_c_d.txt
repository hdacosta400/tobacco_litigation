 6           MR. REILLY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 7           Well, good afternoon everybody.  You know,
 8       when I originally began drafting my closing
 9       argument I had on it good morning, everybody.  But
10       obviously that was overly optimistic.
11           You know, I would like to start my closing
12       argument by also thanking you for your service
13       because we've taken all of you from your homes,
14       your jobs, your families, and we've asked you to
15       come here and do this service.  And I know it
16       hasn't been easy.
17           You've had to spend hours sitting in those
18       seats watching very long videos sometimes, and I
19       know that is very hard because I sit and watch
20       them, too.  And I know how difficult it is to stay
21       concentrated on that.  And we've had some very
22       technical evidence presented to you, too.  We've
23       had medical doctors, we've had scientists, we've
24       had all kinds of evidence presented to you.  And I
25       know that's been hard, too.  This isn't something

 1       you studied in school.
 2           But you've paid close attention and that --
 3       remember when we started this process, I said this
 4       is what makes our system great.  We give you the
 5       power, and along with that goes the
 6       responsibility.  But as litigants in civil
 7       litigation like this, you've done exactly what we
 8       would hope you would do and that is to pay close
 9       attention to the evidence that's been presented
10       during the course of the trial.
11           So on behalf of myself and Mr. Bradford and
12       Philip Morris and frankly everybody here, we
13       communicate our thanks for your service in this
14       case.  Okay.
15           Now, it's not over yet, right?  There's
16       something else for you to do and that is at the
17       end of these closing arguments Judge Mitchell is
18       going to give you the law.  He's going to give you
19       these instructions and you're going to get them in
20       two sets.
21           You're going to get one verdict form first and 22       then, depending on how you answer it, you may or
23       may not get a second verdict form.  And how you
24       answer this one may determine -- will determine,
25       first of all, whether you get a second verdict

 1       form and also which one you get.
 2           But it will be your responsibility to take the
 3       law, the set of instructions that you get from the
 4       Judge, that's the law, and you've now heard all
 5       the facts.  All the facts in this case have been
 6       presented to you.  And it will be your job to put
 7       those two together and to resolve this civil
 8       dispute.  That's why we brought you here.
 9           Okay.  When we started this case I put this
10       board up and I said, you know, this case is going
11       to distill down to these three words.  And I know
12       that after over three weeks of being here it seems
13       maybe amazing that it really did distill down to
14       these three words.
15           And what are they?  Control.
16           For all the stuff that's been said in this
17       room, this case boils down to who was in control
18       of Mrs. Warrick's lifestyle choices that came with
19       the risk of health consequences.  Who was in
20       control?  And that includes her smoking.
21           And during the course of this case you learned
22       that it included more than just her smoking.  You
23       learned that it included her decisions, her
24       choices as related to her heart, exercise, diet,
25       weight, the whole shooting match, because that

 1       informed you -- that informed you how Mrs. Warrick
 2       lived her life, didn't it?
 3           During the course of this trial you got to
 4       know Mrs. Warrick a bit.  You got a window into
 5       how she lived her life, how she made her
 6       decisions, just like all of us make our decisions
 7       every day we wake up, every --
 8           MR. BLOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.  Sidebar,
 9       please.
10           THE COURT:  All right.
11           (A sidebar conference was held outside the
12       hearing of the jury as follows:)
13           MR. BLOCK:  Judge, I move for a mistrial and I
14       object to Mr. -- this is what Mr. Reilly has done
15       starting with and we've objected to it since jury
16       selections in this case.  He has asked this jury
17       to base their verdict in this case based upon
18       their own individual experience, based upon their
19       own collective experience, based upon the fact
20       that they made choices, lifestyle choices with
21       long-term consequences.
22           These are the exact same buzz words he asked
23       every single one of the 70 jurors in this
24       courtroom for a day-and-a-half.  We objected to it
25       at the time.

 1           He then developed the theme through his
 2       opening statement and he's now talking about what
 3       we all do, we all make the choices based on our
 4       whatever, which is, again, inviting the jury to
 5       make their decision on this case based upon their
 6       own collective and individual experiences, which  7       is strictly prohibited under Florida law.  And I
 8       object to it.
 9           MR. REILLY:  I'd like to see the case he's
10       citing, Your Honor, because there is none.  This
11       is just an argument.
12           THE COURT:  Well, the only -- I think you need
13       to be careful though what you say because of the
14       Golden Rule.
15           MR. REILLY:  I understand the Golden Rule
16       relates to me asking the jury to put themselves in
17       -- it's a plaintiff's problem.
18           THE COURT:  I understand.  But that's what --
19       I don't think it only applies to plaintiffs.
20           MR. REILLY:  Well, the Golden Rule asks that
21       -- has counsel asking the jury to put themselves
22       into the shoes of the plaintiff in determining
23       their experience from a damage standpoint and I
24       clearly haven't done that.  I haven't come close
25       to it.

 1           THE COURT:  I'm just saying be careful.  I'm
 2       going to deny your motion for a mistrial and I
 3       overrule your objection at this point.  But be
 4       very careful.
 5           MR. BLOCK:  Could I just put one more thing on
 6       the record?
 7           THE COURT:  Sure.
 8           MR. BLOCK:  I'm not rearguing.  Judge, I have
 9       been in the appellate courts on the Golden Rule
10       and Golden Rule does apply to defendants, it
11       absolutely applies.
12           THE COURT:  I just thought I said that.
13           MR. BLOCK:  Judge, I'm arguing with him, not
14       with you.
15           THE COURT:  Well, we don't need to do that on
16       the record.
17           MR. BLOCK:  Okay.
18           (The sidebar conference was concluded, and the
19       following proceedings were held in open court in
20       the presence of the jury:)
21           MR. REILLY:  Let me go back to where I was.  I
22       just had the court reporter read back to me where
23       I was.
24           You had a window into how Mrs. Warrick lived
25       her life.  You had a chance to glimpse at how she

 1       made decisions that controlled her life every day
 2       just as we all wake up and make decisions that
 3       control our lives every day.
 4           Causation.  What was the cause of
 5       Mrs. Warrick's death?  Now, you've heard a lot of
 6       discussions from plaintiff's counsel during their
 7       closing argument that it doesn't really matter,
 8       we're all in the search for truth.  Perhaps that's
 9       right.  Perhaps we all are in the search for
10       truth.  And perhaps that's why we presented the
11       evidence that we did.
12           Causation.  What was the cause of
13       Mrs. Warrick's death?  And I said when you know
14       the answer -- and I hope you remember the
15       statement when I said, when you know the answer to
16       who was in control of Mrs. Warrick's lifestyle
17       decisions, especially her smoking, and you knew 18       what caused her death, then you could determine
19       who, if anyone, has responsibility for her death,
20       for her developing her chronic obstructive
21       pulmonary disease or her developing her lung
22       cancer and ultimately for her dying.
23           Now, I also told you that these words would
24       not appear on the verdict form.  I said this is
25       the distillation, right?  This is the essence.

 1       This is the essence of what the case is really all
 2       about.
 3           And sure enough, these words are not on the
 4       verdict form.  And the challenge for me today is
 5       going to be how do I manage all these boards, but
 6       I think we'll work our way through it.
 7           Let me just show you the verdict form because
 8       you haven't really seen it yet.  You've just seen
 9       pieces of it.  This is the -- so this is what the
10       verdict form is going to look like that the
11       court's going to give you.  And when you turn the
12       page --
13           THE COURT:  You want lights out?
14           MR. REILLY:  I don't know.  I'm not going to
15       try to read it off of this page.  I have some
16       blowups, Your Honor.  I just want to give the jury
17       -- I want you to see what it is you're going to
18       get, because I think that helps everybody sort of
19       get oriented to what the questions are.  And I'm
20       going it put this up on the board in a just a
21       minute, this first question.
22           But you see, there's a series of four
23       questions that you're going to get asked.  And
24       depending upon how you answer these four
25       questions, your service in this case may be

 1       over -- will be over depending on how you answer
 2       some of them.  So let me go first to the first
 3       question you're going to get asked.
 4           Was Eveline Warrick addicted to cigarettes
 5       containing nicotine and, if so, was her addiction
 6       a legal cause of her chronic obstructive pulmonary
 7       disease, her COPD?
 8           Now, Mr. Shields talked a lot about findings
 9       by another jury in Miami a decade ago.  Those
10       things have nothing to do with you answering this
11       question.  This question is all yours to answer
12       based on the evidence you've seen in this case,
13       all yours.
14           And it's really more than one question at
15       ones, isn't it?  You could put a period right
16       there.  First all, was Eveline Warrick addicted?
17       And, yes, two experts on addiction came here and
18       testified, both Dr. Frazier, their expert, and
19       Dr. Hayes, our expert.  And both of them relied
20       on, as a guideline, this textbook.  You remember?
21           And they both said -- well, actually
22       Dr. Frazier said, yes, she's addicted.
23       Dr. Frazier said she's addicted from sometime in
24       the late '50s all the way through.
25           Now, in her deposition, I pointed out that she

 1       had said she really couldn't say whether she was
 2       -- applying the DSM, she couldn't really say  3       whether she was addicted all the way back because
 4       she didn't have enough data.
 5           But then here at trial she said, you know
 6       what, I can say it because I'm applying my
 7       judgment.
 8           Dr. Hayes says if what she said about her
 9       quitting behavior after 1991 is accurate, then
10       I'll say she was addicted, too, applying this
11       criteria.  Whether she was addicted -- and then
12       Dr. Hayes said, you know what, before that, you
13       can't tell because you don't have enough data.
14       She may well have been for some period of time,
15       but that doesn't mean, and they both agreed, that
16       doesn't mean that she couldn't have quit smoking.
17           Dr. Hayes said Mrs. Warrick could quit smoking
18       any time she was sufficiently committed, motivated
19       to quitting smoking, any time.
20           And that leads me to the second question, the
21       second part of this question.  They have to
22       prove -- and this is their burden of proof -- they
23       have to prove to you in this case by the greater
24       weight of the evidence, that means they have to
25       prove to you by a bigger -- more persuasive amount

 1       of evidence than we brought you, that not only was
 2       she addicted but that her addiction was a legal
 3       cause of her chronic obstructive pulmonary
 4       disease.  Legal cause.
 5           You know, law students go to law school for
 6       three years and they see this definition; what
 7       does legal cause mean.  They go to law school for
 8       three years to try to learn this language.
 9           Lawyers like myself, trial lawyers, we spend
10       the rest our lives trying to learn it and
11       communicate it.  But it's part of -- it's part of
12       the requirement in answering this question.  You
13       know, it's like whatever you do in your job, you
14       know there are steps that you have to do or you
15       haven't done your job right, right?  Depending
16       upon what job you have.
17           You can't close up your shop unless you've
18       done all the things necessary to close it up.  You
19       can't do all the maintenance you're supposed to do
20       until you've done all the steps.  It can be hard,
21       it can be time consuming, it can be no fun, but
22       that's what you have to do and that's what you as
23       jurors have to do in this case, too.
24           So what you have to do is you have to decide
25       whether Mrs. Warrick's addiction caused her COPD,

 1       but not just a little cause, a tiny cause, a
 2       little contribution.  You have to decide whether
 3       or not her addiction was a legal cause.
 4           Well, what does that -- what's the definition?
 5       Here it is.  Addiction to cigarettes containing
 6       nicotine is a legal cause of loss -- let me just
 7       check -- cross that out and put COPD.  Let's put
 8       COPD, because that's our test, right?
 9           Addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is
10       a legal cause of her COPD if it, addiction,
11       directly and in a natural and continuous sequence
12       produces or contributes substantially to producing
13       such loss -- COPD -- so that it can reasonably be 14       said that but for the addiction, the loss, injury
15       -- the COPD would not have occurred.
16           Now, that's a lot.  First of all, that's a lot
17       of law language.  They call it legalese, a lot of
18       legalese.  And we ask you folks to come from your
19       jobs where you don't read legalese every day and
20       we ask you to now interpret this and apply it.
21       That's hard.  That's hard.
22           So what does that mean?  Well, it means that
23       they have to show that without -- if she hadn't
24       been addicted, she wouldn't have gotten her COPD.
25       That's what that "but for" right down there means.

 1       If she hadn't gotten her -- if she hadn't been
 2       addicted she wouldn't have gotten COPD.
 3           Now, Mr. Shields said in his opening
 4       statement, well, the addiction doesn't have to be
 5       the only cause.  There can be a number of causes.
 6       There have been concurring causes.  And sure
 7       enough, there will be a second paragraph to this
 8       already hard paragraph, right?  We don't make your
 9       job easy.
10           Here's the second paragraph.  It says:  In
11       order to be regarded as a legal cause of loss --
12       COPD, addiction need not be the only cause.
13       Addiction may be a legal cause of COPD, even
14       though it operates in combination with the act of
15       another or some other cause, if such other cause
16       occurs at the same time as the addiction and the
17       addiction contributes substantially to producing
18       such COPD.
19           What does all this mean?  What do they have to
20       actually prove?
21           What they have to actually prove is that
22       Mrs. Warrick's addiction was so powerful that she
23       became an involuntary smoker.  That she couldn't
24       stop smoking.  Couldn't stop in time to avoid
25       getting her COPD.

 1           Now, there's something else you need to know,
 2       because I mentioned it in my opening statement and
 3       it's what they admitted.  It's what they admitted.
 4       And you're going to get an instruction that says
 5       just this from the Judge.  Just this.
 6           Says:  The plaintiff has admitted that Eveline
 7       Warrick's acts and omissions relating to the
 8       duration and frequency of her efforts to quit
 9       smoking were a -- now they've only said a partial
10       cause -- of her COPD.
11           Now, they went on to say, to sort of qualify
12       it, they wanted to include R.J. Reynolds and
13       Philip Morris.  But they admitted that Eveline
14       Warrick's acts relating to the duration and
15       frequency of her efforts to quit smoking are a
16       cause, a legal cause of her developing her COPD.
17           Now, what does that mean?  That means they've
18       admitted that Mrs. Warrick could have quit smoking
19       and could have -- they admitted exactly what
20       Dr. Hayes said.  She could have quit smoking and
21       she could have quit in time to avoid her COPD.
22           I mean, how could it be otherwise?  Your
23       failures, your acts and omissions, if you could
24       quit, can't be a cause of you developing COPD 25       because you couldn't quit.  But they've admitted

 1       that her acts and omissions relating to the
 2       duration and frequency of her efforts to quit are
 3       a cause.  That means they'd admitted she could
 4       quit and quit in time to avoid developing her
 5       COPD.
 6           Now, let's remember when Mrs. Warrick
 7       testified she tried to quit for the very first
 8       time.  Do you remember?  1991.  1991.  That is the
 9       very first time she ever decided she was going to
10       quit smoking.
11           Now, they've said Mrs. Warrick was diagnosed,
12       they say for the first time, with COPD, that very
13       same time.  This is when she's at Dr. Bagnoli's
14       office in 1991.  She sees that other lady in the
15       wheelchair.  She says, okay, I'm going to quit
16       smoking.  But Dr. Bagnoli has already diagnosed
17       her at that moment with COPD.
18           So when we talk about her acts and her
19       omissions relating to the duration and frequency
20       of her efforts to quit smoking, she has no efforts
21       to quit smoking before she's already diagnosed, as
22       they said, by Dr. Bagnoli, with COPD.
23           Sometimes you have to wait until closing
24       argument to put this all together.  But now we're
25       going to put it all together.

 1           Now, let's go back, let's go back.  Remember I
 2       said this case was about control.  So now you know
 3       it is about control.  You know it's about
 4       Mrs. Warrick -- and this case is about
 5       Mrs. Warrick.  This case is not about the public
 6       as a whole.  This case isn't about the American
 7       citizens.  This case isn't about any other smoker
 8       aside from Eveline Warrick.  We are here today
 9       about the smoking of Eveline Warrick, period.  End
10       of story.  There is no other smoker in this case.
11           All right.  This case is about control.
12           Now, what did you learn about Mrs. Warrick's
13       life?  What window did you gather into her life
14       during the course of this trial?  Mr. Shields, in
15       his closing argument, said I'm going to use
16       Mr. Reilly's timeline.  And then he said about
17       three things and stopped.  He sure as heck didn't
18       show you my timeline and he sure as heck didn't
19       walk through it, but that's what I'm going to do
20       right now.
21           I'm going to take the very same timeline that
22       I used in my opening statement and I'm going --
23       I'm not going to cover every topic, not every one,
24       but I'll cover the most important ones.  I'll put
25       this up and my timeline.

 1           You remember this all too well?
 2           Yes, Mrs. Warrick was born in 1936.  You
 3       remember what family she was born into?  She was
 4       born into a family that lived on a farm and her
 5       dad grew tobacco.  He grew tobacco, he harvested
 6       it, he cured it, he flavored it with honey, he cut
 7       it up, made cigarettes, cigars, snuff and chewing
 8       tobacco out of it.  And who did he have help him
 9       do that?  Eveline. 10           You remember that the one thing that Eveline
11       wanted out of his Estate, the one thing, was his
12       knife that he used to cut up that tobacco to make
13       cigarettes and cigars out of it.
14           Yes, she has her first cigarette -- and you
15       know that her older sister Annie Mae who she was
16       really close to also smoked, her dad smoked, her
17       grandfather smoked, her older sister smoked, her
18       friends all smoked.  Her friends all smoked and
19       she really -- she had that first cigarette, a
20       Lucky Strike, with her good friend Nancy.
21           Now, she preferred her dad's cigarettes.  She
22       said nothing ever tasted better than my dad's
23       cigarettes, but he didn't give her very many, did
24       he? But she smoked her first cigarette in 1949.
25           Now, Mr. Shields said the reason why she

 1       smoked her first cigarette was because of this
 2       massive advertising campaign.  But you remember I
 3       asked their expert, Dr. Goldberg, if these aren't
 4       the reasons why people start smoking.
 5           Number one, parents; number one.  Absolutely.
 6       Her dad didn't just smoke.  He grew his own
 7       tobacco.  He made his own cigarettes.  He made his
 8       own cigars.
 9           I asked Dr. Goldberg, you know, you've
10       testified, Dr. Goldberg, in tons of cases, tons of
11       tobacco cases.  He's the guy -- remember, he's the
12       old professor and he couldn't tell you how much
13       money he had been paid.  The old professor  -- I
14       asked him:  Professor, have you ever, in all the
15       cases you've looked at, have you ever seen a
16       history like this, an influence like this?
17           No.
18           Brothers and sisters, her dear sister Annie
19       Mae smoked Lucky Strikes.  Her peers, they all
20       smoked Lucky Strikes.  Is it any surprise then --
21       and I asked Dr. Goldberg, don't these things vary
22       from person to person, degree of influence from
23       person to person?
24           Of course they do.  Of course they do.  They
25       vary for everybody.  You could march out there and

 1       ask people did cigarette advertising influence
 2       you, did it cause you to begin smoking or continue
 3       smoking?  How many people do you think would say,
 4       yeah, I think advertising influenced me?
 5           In her case, what do you think the influence
 6       was that caused her to have her first cigarette?
 7       Really?  In light of this background.  She does
 8       have her first cigarette in 1949.
 9           Now, Mr. Shields said -- next thing he talked
10       about was -- matter of fact, he started his
11       closing argument talking about the meeting in New
12       York City.  You remember that?  And he talked
13       about science that existed before 1950.
14           But the truth is, his expert, their expert,
15       Dr. Proctor, you remember the very first live
16       witness they had, he had that kind of unusual
17       collar to his shirt, a fellow from Paloalto, from
18       Stanford, and he said:  You know what, it wasn't
19       until 1950 that the science started to establish
20       -- the real science started to establish a basis 21       for saying that smoking caused lung cancer.  And
22       it started with that study, that statistical study
23       of populations done by Drs. Wynder and Graham, and
24       that really started the ball rolling.
25           And then he talked about the Frank Statement.

 1       He showed you the Frank Statement, but we asked --
 2       we asked Mrs. Warrick specifically about the Frank
 3       Statement.  In this trial you saw her video, you
 4       saw her on video.
 5           And this is the question she was asked:
 6           Have you ever hard of something called the
 7       Frank Statement to cigarette smokers?
 8           And her answer was:  A what?
 9           A Frank Statement to cigarette smokers?
10           And her answer was:  That I'm not familiar
11       with.  That I'm not familiar with.
12           And is it any surprise, you heard from her
13       daughter Norma that her mother was not somebody
14       who watched TV, read the paper, she couldn't
15       remember whether they even had a radio.  She
16       didn't watch the news.  She didn't read magazines.
17       That was Norma's description of her own mom.
18       That's okay.  This is not a criticism.
19           Mr. Shields said -- I think Mr. Block may have
20       said that I was going to get up here and criticize
21       people.  We decide how we live other lives.  And
22       I'm sure as heck not critical of somebody who
23       decides they don't want to watch TV, who advises
24       her children don't watch that, it will turn your
25       brain to jello, you know.  I'm not going to

 1       criticize somebody for that.
 2           But did she see the Frank Statement?  This
 3       case is about Eveline Warrick.  And now you don't
 4       have to wonder whether she saw the Frank Statement
 5       because she got asked the question and she
 6       answered it, flat out:  No, I did not.
 7           What did she think about advertising?  Here
 8       are some things that she said during the course of
 9       the trial about advertising:
10           When did you and your husband have this
11       conversation about the Marlboro man?
12           Oh, we used to laugh, talk about it when it
13       would come on TV all the time.
14           Okay.  So that was when it was on television?
15           Uh-huh.
16           And what about it made you laugh?
17           It was such a stupid commercial to me.
18           Advertising really influenced this lady?
19           Were there any other cigarette advertisements
20       that you thought were stupid?
21           I'm sure there were a lot of them, but I just
22       don't remember them because, well, they had no
23       reason for me to remember them.
24           Anything else, any specific ad?
25           No -- I'm sorry, not really a specific ad.

 1           Okay.
 2           I really don't pay that much attention to ads.
 3           That was Mrs. Warrick's testimony.  You know,
 4       we went on.  We -- I wasn't there at the
 5       deposition, but questions went on, not just about  6       the Frank Statement.  Mrs. Warrick was asked about
 7       if she ever saw anything by any cigarette company
 8       or Mr. Shields referenced the Tobacco Institute or
 9       the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, or
10       Council for Tobacco Research.
11           Mrs. Warrick got asked about every one of
12       those entities and whether or not she ever saw
13       anything that any one of those entities ever said,
14       ever.
15           And here were the questions that were asked
16       and the answers that she gave:
17           Do you know if you have heard any statement
18       made by the Tobacco Industry Research Council?
19           No.
20           No, you didn't?
21           No, I didn't.  I don't remember hearing
22       anything that they did.
23           Have you ever heard any statement made by the
24       Council for Tobacco Research?
25           No, not that I know of.

 1           Do you know if ever heard a statement made by
 2       the Tobacco Institute?
 3           Of the what?
 4           The Tobacco Institute.
 5           I don't think so.
 6           Have you ever heard a cigarette company make a
 7       statement about smoking and health?
 8           Not the cigarette companies.
 9           There it is right there.  Mr. Shields spent --
10       gosh, he was up for, what, an hour and a half, and
11       during that hour-and-a-half-long period he showed
12       you all kinds of things, all kinds of documents
13       from Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds or some other
14       entity but did he ever connect them to
15       Mrs. Warrick?
16           Well, of course he didn't because he couldn't,
17       because, you remember that document he said, we
18       have to provide smokers with a psychological
19       crutch?  Something like that?
20           Did Mrs. Warrick ever see any statement by any
21       cigarette company on the smoking and health issue?
22           And there's her answer right there in black
23       and white.
24           Now, it's okay that people don't learn about
25       the health risks of smoking by reading magazines

 1       or looking at newspapers, things like that.  But
 2       it doesn't mean that they won't learn about the
 3       health risks of smoking.  There are lots of
 4       different ways to learn about that, right?
 5           And even if Mrs. Warrick had no other method
 6       of learning about the health risks of smoking she
 7       learned about it by a very intense personal
 8       experiences.  And you've heard about them in this
 9       courtroom.  She told you about them.
10           And Mr. Shields was up here and he said
11       something like, you know, remember her sister had
12       some sort of a lung problem and it was caused by
13       her being a welder, and then his voice dropped and
14       he said, and smoking cigarettes?
15           Well, that's not what Mrs. Warrick testified
16       to.  What Mrs. Warrick testified to -- oh, and he 17       also said that Mrs. Warrick didn't connect her
18       sister's lung problem to smoking -- to her
19       sister's smoking until the late '80s.  The '80s?
20       But let's see what Mrs. Warrick really said.
21           And here it is.  Talking about her sister
22       Annie Marie's diagnosis of COPD:
23           Do you know when she was diagnosed with COPD?
24           Probably back in the late '50s.
25           How did you find out about her -- and look,

 1       stop right there.  It wasn't some lung disease.
 2       It wasn't some lung ailment.  It was COPD.
 3       Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The same
 4       disease that she gets later, the very same one.
 5           There's no doubt in Eveline's mind what her
 6       sister's condition was.  And there's no doubt when
 7       she was diagnosed.  Probably back in the late
 8       '50s.
 9           How did you find out about her being diagnosed
10       with COPD?
11           Talking to her and going with her to and from
12       the hospitals and doctors' offices.
13           So did you take her to the doctor then?
14           In the late '50s.  Did you take her to the
15       doctors then?
16           Many times.  Many times.
17           Imagine sitting with your sister, sitting with
18       a sister, in a doctor's office, Eveline sitting
19       there, listening to the doctor say to her sister,
20       you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
21           Here's more of the story.
22           When she was diagnosed did y'all talk with the
23       doctors about what was causing the COPD?
24           Yes.
25           What did they say?

 1           Now, is this in the '80s?
 2           This is right there.  She's sitting right
 3       there with her sister in the doctor's office in
 4       the late '50s.  This is not what Mr. Shields told
 5       you.
 6           What did they say?
 7           They said it was her heavy smoking, and she
 8       was a welder during the war in the shipyard.  They
 9       were constantly on her to quit smoking.
10           Those are the questions and those are the
11       answers.  Is that what Mr. Shields told you?
12           Does Mrs. Warrick know in the late '50s that
13       smoking comes with a serious health consequence?
14       You bet she does.  She does because she sat there
15       with her sister that she dearly loved and listened
16       to the doctors give her her diagnosis, COPD, and
17       they told her, hey, this is due to your smoking
18       and you've got to stop smoking.
19           Now, as you know, because Mr. Block went
20       through the 19 years of Mrs. Warrick that he was
21       describing with her COPD, you know that COPD has
22       symptoms.  You know it's a bad cough, breathing
23       problems, and you know it's there.  So it isn't
24       like Mrs. Warrick walks out of the doctor's office
25       with her sister and it's all over, you know.  She

 1       is constantly reminded when she sees her sister.  2       My sister had COPD.  It's caused by her smoking.
 3       The doctors have told both of us that directly and
 4       I've taken my sister to the doctors and the
 5       hospitals any number of times.
 6           Now, that is powerful.  And if there's any
 7       suggestion that -- if there's any suggestion that
 8       it couldn't have been diagnosed in the '50s, well,
 9       first of all, you have her testimony saying, well,
10       that's exactly what the doctor said.
11           And then here's the questions that I asked
12       their historian of science, their history of
13       science expert, Dr. Proctor.  I said:  Dr.
14       Proctor, now, you'd agree with me, Doctor, that in
15       the late '50s there were doctors who were
16       diagnosing their patients with lung cancer and
17       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, weren't
18       there?
19           Yes; yes, sir.
20           So were there doctors telling their patients
21       in the late '50s you have COPD?
22           And there is their historian of science
23       saying, yes, there were.
24           Then I said:  Sir, you'd agree with me that if
25       you were in the doctor's office and the doctor

 1       said that to you, that would be a powerful source
 2       of information telling you that, number one, you
 3       have a disease; and number two, it was caused by
 4       your smoking, right?
 5           And his answer is -- was -- it certainly could
 6       be.  And that was their expert, Dr. Proctor, the
 7       historian of science.
 8           Now, Mr. Shields said I'm going to walk
 9       through Mr. Reilly's timeline, but he definitely
10       did not.  By the way, what are those signs and
11       symptoms of COPD?
12           Here was there expert, Dr. David Burns, the
13       very first expert they had.  And he, at first,
14       describes the technical definition of COPD.  But
15       then when you get down to the bottom here, he
16       says:  However, that technical definition is
17       rarely used in general medical usage, and chronic
18       bronchitis, which is part of COPD, is usually used
19       either to refer to just a chronic cough or to be a
20       synonym for chronic obstructive lung disease.
21       Some people call it COLD, COPD.  Dr. Burns prefers
22       COLD.  What is it?  It's a chronic cough.  That's
23       how it's diagnosed.  That's their expert.
24           Now, let's go ahead on our timeline.  I'm
25       afraid we can't go back in time.  Let's go to the

 1       '60s.  1964.  Yes, there was tremendous coverage
 2       of the Surgeon General's Report in January of
 3       1964.  And, yes, I did show you Harry Reasoner and
 4       I'm going to show it to you again, very briefly.
 5           Can we show that to the jury, the news
 6       coverage of the Surgeon General's Report.
 7           THE COURT:  You need the lights for that?
 8           MR. REILLY:  I think -- I hate to do that to
 9       you guys.  Let me get out of your way.  Let's see
10       if we can do it without.
11           (CBS News video clip played for the jury and
12       transcribed by the reporter as follows:) 13           "This is the CBS news extra on smoking and
14       health.  The findings of the Surgeon General
15       committee:  Almost from the moment that cigarettes
16       were introduced they were attacked.  But the
17       attacks took a new turn ten years ago and
18       culminated in today's report by the Surgeon
19       General committee.  This is what the committee
20       said.  Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung
21       cancer in men and data on women smokers points the
22       same way.
23           Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of
24       cancer of the larynx and probably the most
25       important cause of chronic bronchitis.  Cigarette

 1       smoking may be related to other lots of diseases.
 2       Male smokers have a much higher death rate from
 3       heart disease, although it's not proven that
 4       smoking is the cause.
 5           On the question of filters, the committee said
 6       there is no evidence that they do any good but it
 7       didn't exclude the possibility that an effective
 8       filter might be developed.
 9           In short, the committee said, if you smoke
10       cigarettes you increase your chances of dying
11       early.  The sooner you start, the more you smoke,
12       the more you inhale, the worse your chances are.
13           In this kind of a country, it comes down to
14       you whether you like it or not.  No one is going
15       to forbid an adult to smoke and it is now quite
16       clear that no one is going to tell him it's good
17       for him either.  The decision is his, the decision
18       and the health that may depend on it.
19           This is Harry Reasoner.  Good night."
20           MR. REILLY: Now, I am not saying that
21       Mrs. Warrick saw that because, although that same
22       report or a report like that was on all three
23       channels, she may not have watched TV.  Her
24       daughter said she didn't watch the news.  I accept
25       that.

 1           Mr. Shields said Mr. Reilly only showed you a
 2       short segment and didn't show you this response by
 3       Mr. Cullman.  What I really didn't show you was
 4       the whole program.
 5           Remember Dr. Proctor, their first live expert,
 6       was on the stand and I asked Dr. Proctor:  Doctor,
 7       have you ever watched this whole thing?
 8           No, he hasn't.
 9           I said:  How long is it?  It's well over an
10       hour.  I did not take over an hour of your time to
11       watch that.  I gave you the distillation, right?
12       And I said, if you watched the whole program,
13       could you possibly come away from that not saying
14       to yourself, gosh, if I smoke, I am running the
15       risk that I will develop lung cancer?
16           And he said:  No, that's right.
17           And by the way, Mr. Shields said that the
18       video clips that were played -- sorry, I should
19       have brought this up -- that the video clips that
20       were played showing television programs and public
21       health service announcements against smoking, that
22       they were really concentrated on little timeframe
23       and he told you about a program that ended for 24       reduced rate advertising.
25           He said, oh, it was in a little tiny frame --

 1       little tiny timeframe.  Well, that wasn't right at
 2       all.
 3           I don't know if you'll have a machine back in
 4       the jury room that will allow you to play these
 5       things, but what we provided you was something
 6       from literally every decade, '50s through the
 7       '80s, just we didn't want to burden you with all
 8       the public service announcements or all the
 9       television programs.  That would be a waste of
10       your time.  This is the Reader's Digest version.
11       We didn't give you all the Reader's Digest
12       articles.
13           We gave you -- for example, we gave you the
14       front page news from the Jacksonville paper, the
15       story about the Surgeon General's Report, just so
16       you would get a sense of what the coverage was.
17           And, in fact, in spite of what Mr. Shields
18       said, what we did was give you a video clip from a
19       news program called See It Now with Edward R.
20       Murrow from the '50s.
21           We gave you this Harry Reasoner, just the
22       clip, not the hour-plus program.
23           We gave you the Bill Tallman, 1967 American
24       Cancer Society public service announcement.
25           We gave you the 1968 American Cancer Society,

 1       Cigarettes, They're Killers.  That was the ad
 2       where they got cowboys in the bar.  Pretty cute.
 3           1969, that American Cancer Society snake bite.
 4           We gave you the '69 American Cancer Society,
 5       nice and clear where all that cigarette butts come
 6       out of the ashtray.
 7           The 1969 American Cancer Society warnings that
 8       was all the various warnings and then the warning
 9       about cigarettes.
10           We gave you the 1969 obituary of Bill Tallman.
11       We gave you in the '70s.
12           We gave you 1970, Huff and Puff, that was the
13       Wolf.
14           We gave you dreams.
15           We gave you the first Great American Smokeout
16       with Ed Asner.  We gave you the second Great
17       American Smokeout with Ed Asner in '77 to '78.
18           And then just to bring it to a close, we gave
19       you I think a couple of Larry Hagman's.  Those are
20       from the '80s.  But it was just a sample.  Larry
21       Hagman was an average actor until somehow he got
22       on Dallas, right.  I think it's Dallas, yeah.
23           So we tried to give you a cross-section just
24       to give you a flavor, and we're not saying that --
25       and we gave you a bunch of articles, too,

 1       magazines, newspapers, not to say that
 2       Mrs. Warrick saw those things but just to give you
 3       a flavor of what was going on.
 4           But what I do want to do is show you what we
 5       know Mrs. Warrick was doing, because regardless of
 6       whether she saw the Surgeon General's Report
 7       reported in 1964 she had an experience, once
 8       again, she had an experience that was much more  9       powerful than watching some newscast.  And
10       Mr. Shields didn't mention it at all.
11           You remember, that's when her friend and
12       neighbor Roy Kitchen died from cancer.  Roy was a
13       heavy smoker.  And we asked her about it.
14           Do you know what Roy died of?
15           Cancer.
16           And when did he die?
17           Back around '64, '65.
18           Did you relate the cancer of any of the
19       Kitchen boys to their smoking?
20           Yes.  Yes.
21           She didn't say I didn't do it until late in
22       the '80s.  She said, yes.
23           How about the warning labels?  You know the
24       warning labels go on the packs in 1966.  Let me
25       ask you this, how impactful would it be, if you

 1       want to know whether you are running a risk every
 2       day when you get up, and you smoke a cigarette,
 3       and then you smoke another cigarette, how
 4       impactful is it?  What's the decision that each
 5       person goes through every day?  Whose body is it?
 6       Whose body is it?  Whose responsibility is that
 7       body?  Do you get a second chance?  Do you get a
 8       replacement?
 9           I mean, it's a thing that we -- you know, the
10       truth is, it's a thing that we really hate to
11       admit, we hate to admit, because it's sort of a
12       recognition of how we deal with ourselves.  But
13       it's the truth.
14           Now, on any one of these days, has
15       Mrs. Warrick decided, I want to stop smoking?  I
16       even want to try to stop smoking.  Whether it's
17       the '50s when Annie Marie is diagnosed, in the
18       1950s did she say, you know what, I want to stop
19       smoking?  Annie Marie, I see what's happening to
20       you, I want to stop smoking or I even want to try
21       to stop smoking.
22           And remember I asked, I asked their addiction
23       expert, I asked Dr. Frazier.  Dr. Frazier said she
24       thought around the late '50s that might have been
25       after ten years of smoking she might have been

 1       addicted by that.
 2           I said:  Well, does addiction prevent you from
 3       understanding what you're hearing when you're in
 4       the doctor's office with your sister?
 5           She said:  No, it doesn't prevent you from
 6       understanding what you're hearing.
 7           I said:  If you're addicted, does it prevent
 8       you from deciding that you want to quit or taking
 9       a step toward quitting?
10           She said:  No, it doesn't prevent you from
11       doing any of those things.
12           I said:  Do you know whether or not
13       Mrs. Warrick could have quit in the late '50s?
14           She said:  I don't know.
15           I asked Dr. Hayes, could Mrs. Warrick have
16       quit smoking if she had wanted to in the late
17       '50s?
18           She said if she were committed to quitting,
19       sure, she could have quit. 20           How do we know?  We know she could quit
21       because she did quit, because we know she did
22       quit.
23           Dr. Hayes was asked I think on
24       cross-examination whether or not it would have
25       been easier for Mrs. Warrick to quit in the '50s.

 1           She said:  Probably so.  She smoked fewer
 2       cigarettes.  But she had absolutely no desire to
 3       quit smoking at that point in time.
 4           What did she enjoy about smoking?  I have a
 5       board on that.  Let's see if I can find it real
 6       quick without losing everything.  What did she
 7       testify?  She said she enjoyed the taste,
 8       socialization, especially the relaxation.  It
 9       helped her with boredom.  It was the pleasure of
10       smoking, that's why she smoked.  She smoked with
11       her husband.  Oftentimes they smoked the same
12       brand.
13           You saw Mr. Warrick say we really loved --
14       matter of fact, of all the cigarettes he talked
15       about, they smoked together the Saratoga's that
16       Philip Morris made.  He said we really loved our
17       Saratoga's.
18           Did she enjoy smoking?  Yes, she enjoyed
19       smoking.  There's no question about it.
20           In 1966 what does she think about the warning
21       labels?  This is what she said:
22           What did you think about the warning labels
23       when the warning labels first went on the packs?
24           I really didn't think anything.
25           Okay, didn't surprise you?

 1           Not really.  I just didn't pay any attention
 2       to it I guess.
 3           Did that warning telling you anything you
 4       didn't already know?
 5           I don't think so.
 6           I don't think so either.  By that time her
 7       sister has had COPD and she's been going to the
 8       doctor and the doctor's been telling her it's
 9       because of her smoking and quit smoking for, what?
10       If it's the late '50s and now this is '66, so
11       that's six or seven or eight years. And on top of
12       that, her neighbor Roy Kitchen has already died.
13           Is that warning that says:  Caution, Cigarette
14       Smoke May Be Hazardous to Your Health, is that
15       news to her?  Well, you know it's not and that's
16       why she said, I don't think so.
17           You know it's not.
18           Mr. Block said we want to blame Mrs. Warrick.
19       You know what, when people get up in the morning
20       and look in the mirror and they begin to make the
21       decisions that they make for themselves every day,
22       do you blame yourself for the decisions you're
23       making?  Is that the right term?  Or is it your
24       responsibility?  Is it your body?
25           Still about the '66 warning labels:  Were you

 1       not concerned that there was a warning on the
 2       cigarettes that you were smoking?
 3           I just didn't really pay any attention to it I
 4       guess.  5           Okay.  Well, why not?
 6           Probably busy with something else.
 7           And isn't that exactly what Norma said about
 8       her mom?  Isn't that exactly what Norma said about
 9       her mom?  Probably busy with something else.
10       Didn't watch TV, didn't watch other stuff.  That's
11       okay.
12           Let's go to the end of this decade, the late
13       '60s, early '70s.  Thelma Kitchen.
14           Okay. What did Thelma die of?
15           She had cancer.
16           What kind of cancer, do you know?
17           It was lung cancer and throat cancer.
18           Do you remember the decade?  Was it in the
19       '60s or '70s?
20           I think it was the late '60s or early '70s,
21       somewhere in there.
22           Okay.  For Thelma, did you relate her smoking
23       to her cancer?
24           Thelma I did, uh-huh.
25           She didn't say, no, not then; I didn't relate

 1       Thelma's cancer to her smoking until 15, 20 years
 2       later.  No, she said:  Thelma, I did, uh-huh.
 3           Let's go to the '70s.
 4           This is the exact same timeline that I put up
 5       in my opening statement.  Nothing's changed.
 6       Nothing's changed.
 7           Warnings on the packs change in 1970.
 8       Warning, the Surgeon General Has Determined That
 9       Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health.
10       You can be too busy to pay attention to it.  You
11       can make a craft out of the packs, but every one
12       of these packs had a warning on it at some point
13       in time:
14           1975 -- oh, 1971.  1971, you know, you can
15       tell what people know by what they say.  1971,
16       that's when her oldest daughter Gail said that her
17       mom told her don't smoke, it's dangerous.  Did
18       Mrs. Warrick know that smoking was dangerous?
19       Sure she did.  How else could she tell her
20       daughter, smoking is dangerous, don't do it.
21       Don't smoke, it's dangerous.
22           You heard Mr. Warrick say in his deposition,
23       he said:  Yes, we told our daughters don't smoke.
24       And you know that has to be in this timeframe
25       because they're going to leave the house a little

 1       later in this decade, right?  So in order to tell
 2       them, they've got to be there and they never
 3       returned.
 4           You remember that?
 5           1975, Mrs. Warrick and her husband Calvin
 6       switched to Saratoga's.  Now, is it exactly 1975?
 7       No one really knows but that's when Philip Morris
 8       first began to make Saratoga's.  And did they
 9       switch because of advertising?  Did she switch
10       because of advertising?
11           Dr. Goldberg:  Did she switch because of
12       advertising?
13           No.  She was asked, why did you switch to
14       Saratoga's.
15           Probably the same sort of thing when he 16       started Pall Mall and they were just out of your
17       brand that day?
18           Uh-huh.
19           And you got a new brand and decided it was all
20       right?
21           I know that's how I started on Saratoga's.
22           They were out of your brand that day at the
23       store.
24           And then:  Did you like the taste of the
25       Saratoga's better than the taste of Viceroy?

 1           Yeah.
 2           How long does she smoke Saratoga's?  Well,
 3       that's not really clear.  On Dr. Goldberg's chart
 4       he has it down until 1985.  That would be about
 5       ten years out of a 50-year-smoking history.  That
 6       may be right.  That may be a little too long,
 7       maybe a little short but that's all right.
 8           She smoked Saratoga's with her husband Calvin.
 9       No debate about it.
10           Has she, up to this point in time, with what
11       she's telling her daughter, with the warnings on
12       the packs, has she decided that she has any
13       interest in giving up the taste, socialization,
14       relaxation, pleasure of smoking?
15           No, not once.  Not once.  And you know it.
16           Well, what happens in the late '70s?  You
17       remember -- and Mr. Shields didn't even mention
18       this in his closing argument, nor did Mr. Block.
19           In the late '70s she goes to Dr. Sapp.  She
20       goes there because she has a terrible cough and
21       breathing problems.  Now, in the late '70s she's
22       been around her sister for, what, 20 years, Annie
23       Marie that has COPD.  20 years.  She's been going
24       to the doctor's office with Annie Marie for 20
25       years listening to the doctor, listening to,

 1       observing her sister's symptoms, and you now know
 2       from Dr. Burns what those symptoms are, chronic
 3       cough, breathing problems.  Same symptoms she's
 4       got.
 5           She goes to Dr. Sapp and she says, here are my
 6       symptoms.  What does Dr. Sapp tell her?  Well, of
 7       course, Dr. Sapp is dead, he's long dead.  His
 8       records are long gone.
 9           But she tells us, Mrs. Warrick tells us that
10       he said to her, this is due to your smoking, this
11       is due to your smoking.
12           Here's the testimony: When did the cough get
13       worse?
14           Actually back in the '70s it got pretty bad.
15           And you were seeing Dr. Sapp at that time; is
16       that correct?
17           Uh-huh.
18           And was he telling you then that the cough was
19       related to the smoking?
20           Yes.  He had the same problem.
21           Now, this doesn't -- she didn't testify that
22       Dr. Sapp said, oh, it's nothing, don't worry about
23       it.  What doctor would?  I mean, really, what
24       doctor would?
25           Did you tell him you were having problems
5097  1       breathing?
 2           He knew it, yeah.  We discussed it.
 3           Did he tell you that the breathing problems
 4       were related to the smoking?
 5           Yes, many times.
 6           This is not a single visit to the doctor.
 7           Yes, many times.
 8           Many times.  And that was back in the '70s?
 9           Yeah.
10           Mr. Shields showed you this question.  Maybe
11       this is a good time to put this up.  On the
12       verdict form the second question, just so you see
13       it, this second question -- that second question
14       is this question:
15           Did Eveline Warrick know or should she have
16       known after the exercise of reasonable diligence
17       that she suffered from chronic obstructive
18       pulmonary disease, COPD, and that she had a claim
19       for damages against these defendants?  Whose
20       cigarettes is she smoking?
21           She's already been smoking R.J. Reynolds'
22       cigarettes and right now she's smoking Philip
23       Morris's cigarettes.  She's just been told by the
24       doctor, yes, your bad cough, your breathing
25       problems, and she's been told many times by

 1       Dr. Sapp, are due to your smoking.
 2           Now, we don't have Dr. Sapp's records where we
 3       can show you this is what he said, this is what he
 4       diagnosed.  But this goes on through the '80s and
 5       on into the '90s.
 6           Now, Dr. Bagnoli said, I'm the first person to
 7       -- I first diagnosed her with COPD in 1991, right?
 8       But if you look at the medical records you'll see
 9       that Dr. Bagnoli saw her for the first time in
10       1991.  And Dr. Bagnoli got asked, did you know
11       that she had been to see Dr. Sapp?  Did you know
12       that Dr. Sapp had treated her?
13           No, he didn't know that, because the first
14       time he ever sees her is in 1991, and the first
15       time he ever sees her he diagnosis her with COPD.
16           And what did can Dr. Sapp say -- I'm sorry,
17       what did Dr. Bagnoli say about how long she had
18       COPD?  He said, well, she had severe COPD when I
19       first saw her so, of course, she's had COPD for
20       years.  Years.
21           Now, if somehow in all those visits she made
22       to Dr. Sapp he never told her what Dr. Burns said
23       a doctor would say, make the diagnosis based on a
24       chronic cough, this isn't limited to what you
25       absolutely know, but it's what you should have

 1       known after the exercise of reasonable diligence.
 2           You know, there are some people -- there are
 3       some people who they don't want to go to the
 4       doctor, they don't want to ask the doctor.  You
 5       know how that works.
 6           With the exercise of reasonable diligence, if
 7       she didn't already know, could Mrs. Warrick have
 8       known, just with the exercise of reasonable
 9       diligence, that she had COPD?  She sat there with
10       her sister for 20 years now watching the symptoms,
11       watching the diagnosis; watching the symptoms, 12       watching the diagnosis.
13           Does she have a claim for damages?  Well,
14       we're here, aren't we?  If you answer this
15       question, no -- and that's not by the end of the
16       '70s, this is by May of 1990 -- if you answer this
17       question -- I'm sorry, if you answer this
18       question, yes, then the case is over and your work
19       is done.
20           Let's go to the '80s.  Let's go to the '80s.
21       The ministers are discouraging people from
22       smoking.  1985 her sister Annie Marie dies of COPD
23       and lung cancer. In 1985 Annie Marie dies.  Does
24       she have any interest in quitting smoking at that
25       moment?  Giving up the pleasure that she gets from

 1       smoking?  No.
 2           She says:  No, not yet.
 3           The warnings changed on the packs.  Did she
 4       pay any attention to the warnings on the packs?
 5       No.  We already talked about that.
 6           So let's go to 1988.  That's when Calvin has a
 7       heart attack.  He's 58 years old.  Now, it's at
 8       that point that Mrs. Warrick says:  You know what,
 9       I recognize that we needed to make some lifestyle
10       changes.  I recognize that.  She told you that.
11       You saw her on the screen.  We need to quit
12       smoking.
13           What's their diet like?  Let's see what Calvin
14       says about his diet.  Here's Calvin, he says, you
15       told us that you're a diabetic?
16           I'm a diabetic.
17           How did that work?
18           I became a diabetic, I brought it on myself.
19           How long ago did that happen?
20           I think this is Mr. Block actually asking
21       these questions on the video.
22           How long ago did that happen?
23           I -- I knew it, this all -- I want to call it
24       -- I'd eat Three Musketeer bars.
25           Uh-huh.

 1           No, I would eat every bite.  I'd eat three or
 2       four a day.
 3           These are decisions that we make.  He's
 4       smoking.  That's his diet.  Is it any surprise he
 5       has a heart attack?
 6           You heard Mrs. Warrick say at one point, she
 7       says:  I weighed 285 pounds.  She's five foot
 8       five.  You heard the doctor say she's morbidly
 9       obese.
10           You know that when the autopsy occurs her
11       heart is surrounded in fat and it's interlaced
12       with fat and gristle and you know that's from her
13       diet.  Exercise.  It's not a criticism.  We all
14       get to live exactly how we want to live but when
15       you wake up in the morning and you look in the
16       mirror --
17           MR. BLOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.
18           THE COURT:  All right.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
23           THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Reilly, you may
24       continue.
25           MR. REILLY:  Thank you, Your Honor.

 1           Let's be clear.  If I say to you in this
 2       closing argument, if I make a reference to "you",
 3       I'm not talking about you folks in particular.
 4       I'm talking about you in general.  I'm talking
 5       about people in general, okay.  So don't think I'm
 6       trying to talk about you folks in particular, all
 7       right?
 8           But that is what I mean, when you wake up in
 9       the morning, when people wake up in the morning
10       and they look in the mirror and they say to
11       themselves, now, we don't do this every day, we
12       don't wake up every day and say, gosh, today I'm
13       going -- every day I'm going to do this or I'm
14       going to do that.  But that's something we
15       impliedly do, isn't it?  It is our bodies.  It is
16       our lives.  It's nobody else's.
17           Her husband had a heart attack.  At that time
18       you encouraged him to quit smoking; is that
19       correct?
20           I constantly tried to get him to quit smoking.
21           But did she decide to quit smoking in 1988?
22       You know she didn't.  You know that she didn't
23       make any effort to quit smoking until 1991.
24           What specifically did you tell your husband
25       after his heart attack about quitting smoking?

 1           I said we both need to quit.
 2           Did you --
 3           But even I didn't try until 1991.
 4           And if there was any question as to why she
 5       didn't pay any attention to the warnings, here was
 6       the question she was asked and the answer that she
 7       gave:
 8           Would you not have paid attention to warning
 9       labels on cigarettes because you loved your
10       cigarettes?
11           Probably.
12           It's okay.  Here in the United States it's
13       legal to drink alcohol if you're of the right age,
14       it's legal to smoke cigars, cigarettes, to buy
15       chewing tobacco if you're at the right age.  It's
16       a right that you have here in this country.
17           And you can buy Three Musketeer bars, you can
18       buy Three Musketeers bars and you can eat three or 19       four a day until you give yourself diabetes.
20           But you got to say to yourself, I brought it
21       on myself.  And that's exactly what Mr. Warrick
22       said, because along with the right to buy, is the
23       responsibility, right?
24           1991, she decides to quit.  Now, over the next
25       nine years she spends a variety of instances -- or

 1       she describes a variety of instances of quitting
 2       smoking.  The one that didn't come up in her
 3       testimony was to quit in 1993 which, remember,
 4       Dr. Bagnoli testified about.
 5           He says, we found a lesion in her throat and
 6       we told her this is precancerous, potentially
 7       cancerous, and you need to stop smoking, you need
 8       to stop smoking now.  And she did, and she stopped
 9       smoking, right?  You need to stop smoking and she
10       did until, what?  Until the lesion went away.
11           And that's what Dr. Hayes says she said when
12       she's sufficiently motivated to quit, when she
13       decides she'll really going to quit she can quit
14       and she does quit.
15           And how long did she stay quit?  Well, we
16       don't know exactly how long but it was long enough
17       for this lesion, that problem to go away.  Was
18       that a month?  Was it three months?  We don't
19       know.  But what we do know is that Dr. Bagnoli
20       said she didn't resume smoking and she must not
21       have because it went away and stayed away.
22           So she stays quit long enough for that
23       condition to go away.
24           Now, I don't know if you've heard it but
25       Mr. Shields said in his closing argument that she

 1       quit in 2001.  So apparently when I sit down, and
 2       after Mr. Engram sits down, he's going to -- I
 3       don't know, is he going to disavow what every
 4       family member said about how Mrs. Warrick quit?  I
 5       don't know, but every family member who came here,
 6       Mr. Warrick, Mrs. Warrick, Norma Warrick, and even
 7       one of the daughters that never came here, Lynell,
 8       we learned about her testimony from her deposition
 9       through the testimony of Dr. Goldberg, they all
10       agree that's how Mrs. Warrick quit.  How did she
11       quit?
12           On Thanksgiving Day at Norma's house, Norma
13       had that cute little Jack Russell terrier.  And
14       Mrs. Warrick said:
15           And I don't know, there was just something
16       about that dog that was telling me you got to
17       quit.  And I was sitting there smoking a
18       cigarette.  I put it out, and I never put another
19       one in my mouth; never put another one in my
20       mouth.
21           Did she have withdrawal symptoms?  Mr. Shields
22       said she did but, in fact, do you remember she was
23       sitting there and she was answering questions and
24       she was asked -- well, first of all, before she
25       even quit that day, you have to know that she

 1       wasn't on any nicotine replacement.  She wasn't on
 2       any medication.  She had no withdrawal symptoms.
 3       She had no lack of concentration and most  4       importantly, she had no craving.  No cravings at
 5       all.  She never craved another cigarette, not one
 6       more in her life.
 7           And she stayed quit without smoking another
 8       cigarette for what?  Ten years?  Nine years?  Ten
 9       years; ten years.
10           That's why Dr. Hayes says, you know what, any
11       time she's sufficiently -- what she actually said
12       exactly was she wants to quit because of her
13       daughter's Jack Russell terrier.  Whenever she's
14       sufficiently motivated and why that motivated her?
15       Who knows.  Why that was the sufficient motivation
16       for her after all of the things that she had seen
17       and experienced?  Who knows.
18           But was she able to quit and quit without any
19       difficulty?  You know the answer.  You know the
20       answer.
21           So why do people do the things they do?
22       Remember we asked -- Dr. Hayes is who had the
23       Ph.D. in psychology and she had great expertise in
24       human behavior, and she was asked:  So why do
25       people do this?

 1           And she explained there was short-term
 2       gratification is nice.  It's basically you got
 3       that donut sitting right here, right there and you
 4       can either eat that donut or not.  And you know in
 5       the back of your mind that you want to reach this
 6       goal of being thinner and having better health,
 7       but at the same time that donut sitting right
 8       there and it's really, really good, and so many
 9       times people give up and eat the donut even though
10       they know it's bad for them.
11           I mean, you've heard of many people go on diet
12       and lose weight, gain weight, lose weight, it's
13       not unusual.
14           Mr. Warrick -- I couldn't have imagined a
15       better example of that very statement than
16       Mr. Warrick's self description.  I couldn't
17       imagine it.  He has eaten three or four Three
18       Musketeer's bars so long and he knows that he has
19       made himself a diabetic.  Yet he's still doing it.
20           Now, is anybody -- his doctor probably
21       criticizes him, but nobody's criticizing him
22       because that's a decision that he's made.  That's
23       how he wants to live his life.  It's a pleasure
24       for him in life.
25           In his closing argument Mr. Block said, this

 1       case isn't about donuts.  It isn't about
 2       chocolate.  But really in a way -- and, of course,
 3       in a way it's not, but in another way it is.
 4       That's human behavior and that's exactly what
 5       Dr. Hayes explained.  That's exactly what
 6       Dr. Hayes explained.
 7           Your Honor, this would be a good time --
 8           THE COURT:  All right.
 9           MR. REILLY:  -- to take a break.
[#DELETED RECESS#]
18            MR. REILLY:  You know, on the break I thought
19       of -- I thought I should end that line with one more
20       comment about Mrs. Warrick's quitting.  Just on the
21       chance that Mr. Shields gets up and says, Well --
22       but the medical records indicate that she didn't
23       quit until some months into 2001, let's not forget
24       Mrs. Warrick's testimony that she didn't really tell 25       anybody that she was going to quit or that she was

 1       quit until several months had gone by so that she
 2       could be sure that she'd actually quit.
 3            And every family member, including Lynell that
 4       didn't come here, indicated that's the day she quit.
 5       And Dr. Bagnoli indicated, "She would know far
 6       better than I when she quit."
 7            All right.  So now let me -- let's take us
 8       back.  That's the end of my timeline.  So let's take
 9       us back to the verdict form and the questions that
10       you're going to be asked on the verdict form.
11            "Was Eveline Warrick addicted to cigarettes
12       containing nicotine and, if so, was her addiction a
13       legal cause" -- and now you know the concept of
14       legal cause -- "was her addiction a legal cause of
15       her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?"
16            And now you know that in order for addiction to
17       have been the legal cause, it has to have been so
18       powerful, so impactful that she couldn't quit; even
19       if she tried to quit she couldn't have quit, that
20       compelled her to keep on smoking until she had
21       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which you now
22       know from the testimony of Dr. Andrews and from the
23       testimony of Dr. Bagnoli, the testimony of
24       Dr. Burns, she really had in the late '70s and
25       throughout the '80s.

 1            Matter of fact, Dr. Burns testified that by the
 2       time you have the symptoms she had, you've already
 3       lost 60 percent, 70 percent of your lung function.
 4       That's by the time you have the symptoms she had in
 5       the late '70s.
 6            Had she even attempted -- had she even wanted
 7       to stop smoking by that time?  You already know the
 8       answer to that.  And could she have quit?  They've
 9       already admitted that she could quit; otherwise, how
10       could they have admitted that she was a cause of her
11       own illness?
12            Now, Mr. Shields in his closing argument spent
13       an enormous amount of time talking about misconduct
14       by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.  And he's right
15       that I did say in my opening statement that during
16       the course of this trial you are going to see
17       documents that reflected things that you wouldn't do
18       and I wouldn't do.  No debate about that.
19            Some of those things were bad ideas.  And the
20       one that comes immediately to mind -- remember
21       Dr. Goldberg, their marketing guy, showed you a memo
22       from a fellow in Nashville, Nashville, Tennessee,
23       working for Philip Morris in 1953.  He wrote a memo
24       that said, "Gosh, I think we ought to give away
25       candy cigarettes, chocolate cigarettes, with a

 1       Philip Morris logo on them."  A bad idea.  I mean,
 2       let's face it, that's a bad idea.  It was a bad idea
 3       in 1953.  It's a bad idea today.
 4            But you remember what I asked Dr. Goldberg?  I
 5       said, "You know what, Dr. Goldberg, you know Philip
 6       Morris never did that, don't you?"
 7            His answer was:  "Mr. Reilly, if you say so, I
 8       agree."  He knew it.  He knew it never happened.
 9       Some guy in Nashville.  Okay. 10            And there are other things that happened that
11       I'm not going to stand up here and support.  Am I
12       going to stand up here and support Joe Cullman on
13       Face the Nation?  No.  I'm not going to tell you
14       that was a good thing.  I am going to tell you that
15       it is not a legal cause of Mrs. Warrick beginning
16       smoking, continuing smoking, quitting smoking.
17            Where was the connection?  Where was the impact
18       of Joe Cullman on Face the Nation, a show that no
19       one ever said Mrs. Warrick ever watched?  Where was
20       the impact between Joe Cullman saying that and this
21       case?  Not some other case, not some class action,
22       not some -- not some lawsuit where somebody was a
23       watcher of Face the Nation, but this case.  This is
24       Eveline -- Eveline Warrick's case.  I apologize for
25       mispronouncing that.

 1            This is a board I made.  And it's sort of a
 2       shorthand for me for how I think about legal cause.
 3       If there's no direct connection, then there can't be
 4       a substantial impact.  If there can't be a -- if
 5       there isn't a substantial impact, then there's no
 6       legal cause.  It's just a little shorthand way of
 7       thinking about it.
 8            Like the Frank Statement.  If Mrs. Warrick
 9       never saw the Frank Statement, then there's no
10       direct connection to her, it can't have had a
11       substantial impact on her, and it can't be a legal
12       cause of injury to her, can it?
13            What other things did -- failure to warn.  Of
14       all the carcinogens in cigarette smoke, if you stop
15       and think about it for just a minute, did Philip
16       Morris, R.J. Reynolds in 1964 when they -- when --
17       or '62 or '3 when Philip Morris sent that list of
18       chemical compounds to the Surgeon General and said,
19       "Here.  Here are all the chemicals we've identified
20       in smoke so far" -- and that list included some
21       carcinogens -- if at the same time Philip Morris had
22       put that on a package of cigarettes, do you
23       think Philip -- do you think that really and truly
24       Mrs. Warrick would have had any reaction to that
25       whatsoever?  Really and truly, now.

 1            Direct connection, substantial impact, no legal
 2       cause.  By that time -- by 1964 when the Surgeon
 3       General's report came out, Mrs. Warrick had already
 4       had her sister diagnosed with COPD.  She'd sat in
 5       the doctor's office day after day with her sister.
 6       The doctors had said, "It's due to your smoking.
 7       You've got to stop smoking."
 8            Her friend Roy Kitchen, lung cancer, died.  Do
 9       you really think if -- and she paid no attention to
10       the warnings in '66 and '70 and '85.  In all candor,
11       in all candor, is there a connection, an impact, a
12       legal cause?
13            All right.  So what's the first question on the
14       verdict form?  "Was Eveline Warrick addicted to
15       cigarettes containing nicotine and, if so, was her
16       addiction a legal cause to her COPD?"  The answer to
17       that is no.  I believe the answer to that is no.
18            THE COURT REPORTER:  Mr. Reilly, could you
19       stand on the other side of the board so I can see
20       you when you speak? 21            MR. REILLY:  Yes, I will --
22            THE COURT REPORTER:  Thank you.
23            MR. REILLY:  I will try very hard.
24            Let me just walk you through -- the court
25       reporter asked me to stand over here so she could

 1       hear me -- Question Number 2, "Did Eveline Warrick
 2       know or should she have known, after the exercise of
 3       reasonable diligence, that she suffered from COPD
 4       and that she had a claim for damages against these
 5       defendants, the people whose cigarettes she knew she
 6       smoked, for her COPD prior to May 5th, 1990?"
 7       Answer to that is yes.
 8            And if you look on the verdict form, after each
 9       of those questions it says, "If your answer to
10       Question 1 is yes, then proceed to Question 2.  If
11       your answer to Question 1 was no, please proceed no
12       further except to sign and date this verdict form."
13            So if your answer to Question 1 is that her
14       addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine -- if
15       you conclude she was addicted -- was it a legal
16       cause of her COPD, if the answer to that is no, you
17       do nothing further.  You go home.
18            If you answer Question Number 2, "Did Eveline
19       Warrick know or should she have known, after the
20       exercise of reasonable diligence, that she suffered
21       from COPD and that she had a claim for damages
22       against these defendants for her COPD prior to
23       May 5th, 1990" -- if the answer to that question is
24       yes, then you go no further.  You go home.
25            The next two questions ask, "What was the cause

 1       of her death?  Was it COPD or was it lung cancer?"
 2       You only get to those questions if you've answered
 3       Question 1 "yes" or Question 2 "no."
 4            I'm going to let Mr. Engram talk to you about
 5       the other two questions.
 6            Now, only if you answer questions 1 and 2 in a
 7       way that tells you to go forward will you even get
 8       one of the two new verdict forms.  Now, I don't
 9       think you'll get there, but on the chance that you
10       do, I'm just going to walk through it with you.
11            This is the wrongful death form.  There's a
12       survival form and a wrongful death form.  I could
13       have picked either one of them.  It doesn't really
14       matter because most of the questions are the same.
15            The first question on this form is, "State for
16       each defendant whether the defective cigarettes
17       placed on the market by each defendant were a legal
18       cause of the death of Mrs. Warrick."
19            Now, this is where those findings by that other
20       jury come to bear.  And they are binding on you.
21       There's no question about that.
22            But you'll have to apply the same legal cause
23       formula.  Is there a direct connection of
24       substantial impact so that you can say there's a
25       legal cause formula onto each of these questions

 1       about defective cigarettes -- I'm going to skip 2
 2       and 3 for just a minute and say it applies for
 3       Questions 4, 5 and 6, as well.
 4            But let's look at Question -- Questions 2
 5       and 3 for just a minute.  "State whether or not  6       defendant" -- "state for each defendant whether
 7       the fraudulent concealment was reasonably relied
 8       upon" -- "reasonably relied on by Eveline to her
 9       detriment."
10            There is no evidence in this case whatsoever
11       that Mrs. Warrick relied on anything that Philip
12       Morris or R.J. Reynolds said or failed to say about
13       the health risks of smoking.
14            You've just walked through her personal story.
15       You know what information she got.  You know when
16       she got it.  You know from their admission that she
17       got it in time.  If she wanted to decide to quit
18       smoking, she could have.
19            You heard her say with her own words from the
20       deposition that you saw that she never heard
21       anything from Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds or
22       any other company.
23            The agreement to conceal or omit material
24       information was the legal cause of Mrs. Warrick's
25       death.  Again, no direct connection, no substantial

 1       impact, no legal cause.
 2            All right.  And, finally, if you get this
 3       far -- and, like I said, I don't think you do -- but
 4       if you get this far, you have to assign a percentage
 5       of fault to Ms. Warrick, R.J. Reynolds, Philip
 6       Morris.  The only thing I'll say about that is --
 7       once again, I'm not talking about you folks, but
 8       when we wake up in the morning, when we look in the
 9       mirror, who do we see?  Who stares back at us?  Who
10       stares back at us in the body we know?  Who's
11       responsible for the body we know every day, every
12       minute, every hour, every day?  Who decides what we
13       put in our body?  Who decides how we treat our body
14       every minute, every day?  I leave that to your sound
15       discretion.
16            I don't think you get this far, but if you do,
17       Mr. Block went through a series of mathematical
18       formulas, calculations, trying to give you a method
19       for determining how to value mental pain and
20       suffering, loss of companionship, loss of support
21       and services, loss of companionship or protection,
22       mental pain and suffering.
23            There is no formula for doing that.  You can't
24       divide it into hours and minutes.  That's within
25       your sound discretion.  Matter of fact, add up all

 1       the hours in this day.  See how many hours are in
 2       this day.
 3            That brings us to this final question:  "Under
 4       the circumstances of this case, please state whether
 5       by clear and convincing evidence" -- now, that's a
 6       different standard -- "punitive damages are
 7       warranted against each defendant."  Punitive
 8       damages.
 9            Well, first of all, what's this higher
10       standard?  Well, you're going to get an instruction
11       on it.  The Court's going to instruct you on what is
12       "clear and convincing."
13            But it is just exactly what it sounds like.
14       The evidence they presented has got to be so clear
15       that it just absolutely convinces you that punitive
16       damages are warranted in this case. 17            And the very first thing you're going to see on
18       that punitive damage instruction is that it has to
19       relate to Mrs. Warrick.  No direct connection, no
20       substantial impact, no legal cause.
21            Now, who did they bring here from -- did they
22       bring here from Philip Morris?  They brought that
23       fellow Dr. Farone, who used to work at Philip Morris
24       about 30 years ago, over 30 years ago; former Philip
25       Morris employee.  Remember I asked him -- you know,

 1       he was critical of Philip Morris.  He had four or
 2       five reasons why he was critical of Philip Morris,
 3       but he's receiving a pension of $18,000 a year from
 4       Philip Morris.  It gets paid for by the sale of
 5       cigarettes.
 6            Mr. Shields talked to you about a gentleman's
 7       agreement.  A couple things about the gentleman's
 8       agreement.  You remember, I'm the one who
 9       cross-examined Dr. Farone on video.  And I said,
10       "Dr. Farone, you seem to be a bit puzzled as to when
11       that gentleman's agreement was supposed to have gone
12       into effect.  Was it last year?  You said it was --
13       started in '54 or '64.  You've given two different
14       time frames in -- in the space of two months just
15       last year."
16            He tried to justify why he couldn't tell when
17       it occurred.
18            And then I said, "What was that agreement?"  It
19       was to not do biological research on -- I mean,
20       think about this.  This is their explanation.
21       "Philip Morris won't do biological research on
22       intact animals in its own facilities in Richmond,
23       Virginia."
24            Number one, he admitted that Philip Morris
25       sponsored, along with the National Cancer Institute,

 1       other -- and I brought Mr. Jupe here to show you
 2       that Philip Morris sponsored intact animal studies
 3       cosponsored with the National Cancer Institute here
 4       in the United States.
 5            And then I said -- and a bunch of other
 6       studies, too.  I put up, I don't know, two or three
 7       examples of studies that Philip Morris did that were
 8       in direct conflict with what Dr. Farone testified
 9       to.
10            And I said, "Dr. Farone, let me ask you a
11       couple more things.  Number one, if there was ever
12       such an agreement, you know that Philip Morris
13       didn't adhere to it, don't you?"  And he said,
14       "Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it was violated.  I'm not saying
15       it wasn't violated all the time."
16            And I said, "Well, if there was such an
17       agreement and it was violated all the time, that's a
18       good thing, isn't it?"  And he said, "Yeah that's a
19       good thing."
20            And I said, "Well, did anything that Philip
21       Morris ever did" -- "Your job at Philip Morris was
22       to try help design a safer cigarette, not you all by
23       yourself."  All those -- 80 percent of the men and
24       women that work in the Research and Development
25       Department at Philip Morris are there.  They put

 1       their pants on, they put their shoes on, put their  2       dresses on, they put their coats on and go to work
 3       every day with one thought in mind, and that is,
 4       "How can we improve cigarettes?"
 5            I think the men are putting their pants on, the
 6       women are putting their dresses on.  I wondered
 7       where I was going with that.
 8            Well, what do they do?  They work to get the
 9       safest cigarette as people want to buy.
10            Dr. Farone said, "Well, Philip Morris designed
11       its cigarettes to sustain addiction.  I brought
12       Mr. Jupe here who actually designs cigarettes.  And
13       I said, "How do you guys design your cigarettes?"
14            He said, "We design them like any other
15       consumer company in the world.  We put some stuff
16       together, we bring people in.  We say, 'You tell us
17       what you want.  You tell us what you like.'  And
18       guess what, that's what we're going to sell."
19            Do you think consumer companies can exist if
20       they don't do that?  I mean, really.  Do you think
21       that the Morris company doesn't do that with Milky
22       Ways or 3 Musketeers?  That's how consumer companies
23       make sure that the products they make are what
24       consumers want.
25            I asked Dr. Farone, "Are you proud of the work

 1       that you did at Philip Morris?"
 2            Yes, he was.
 3            I said "The people in the Research and
 4       Development Department of Philip Morris were
 5       dedicated to making a safer cigarette?"
 6            "Yes."
 7            "Filters, vent holes, porous paper,
 8       reconstituted tobacco and expanded tobacco were
 9       all good ideas, weren't they?"
10            "Yes."
11            That's what Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds
12       worked on with the Tobacco Working Group.  That's
13       what Mr. Jupe explained to you about.
14            "Philip Morris doesn't spike cigarettes with
15       nicotine.  The amount of nicotine decreases over the
16       manufacturing process?"
17            "Correct."
18            "Cigarettes without additives" -- sometimes
19       people think that additives make cigarettes more
20       dangerous or more addicting, but he admitted,
21       "Cigarettes without additives are not safer or less
22       addicting," period.
23            Now, the design efforts -- the design changes
24       by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, they resulted in
25       improved risk cigarettes, not safer.

 1            All the way back in 1981, the Surgeon General
 2       said, "Yes."  This was what I read you right out of
 3       the Surgeon General's 1981 report.  "Cigarette smoke
 4       condensate of present cigarettes produces fewer
 5       tumors on mice skin" -- "mouse skin than did that of
 6       cigarettes tested some 30 years ago.
 7            "This difference is probably because today's
 8       cigarettes contain more tobacco stems and more
 9       reconstituted tobacco and have cigarette paper with
10       higher porosity."  Those were some of those changes;
11       you remember?  "All contributing to smoke condensate
12       but is less tumorigenic," makes fewer tumor, "to the 13       experimental animal."
14            Now, safe cigarette?  No.  Hopefully a little
15       less risky.  Still plenty of risk.  Don't smoke if
16       you're not willing to take the risk.
17            And the final question that I asked Mr. Jupe,
18       the final question I asked him was, "Mr. Jupe,
19       cigarettes are made all around the world.  Will you
20       tell this jury whether or not someplace in the world
21       they make cigarettes less risky" -- I don't care how
22       you say it -- "less risky or safer than the ones
23       made right here in the United States, right here by
24       Americans?"
25            He said, "Nowhere."

 1            So I would suggest to you that in light of the
 2       fact, going back to --
 3            (Board fell over.)
 4            MR. REILLY:  My little Engle cause diagram.
 5       I'll just hold it.
 6            Going right back to that, ask yourself.
 7       Whatever it was that you didn't like that you saw
 8       during the course of this trial that Philip Morris
 9       or R.J. Reynolds did, did the plaintiffs actually
10       prove that it impacted Mrs. Warrick, really and
11       truly?  It may have made you mad.  It's okay to be
12       mad, but did it really impact Mrs. Warrick?  Because
13       this is her case.
14            Okay.  I'm done.  The answer to that question
15       is no.  I'm going to sit down.  Mr. Engram is going
16       to get up and he's going to talk to you about what
17       caused Mrs. Warrick's death.
18            Thank you.  And I promise not to have any more
19       disasters up here.
20            After he's done, Mr. Shields and maybe
21       Mr. Block, maybe Mr. Kalil, I don't know, because
22       they have the burden of proof, either by the greater
23       weight of the evidence, the preponderance of the
24       evidence, or in the case of punitive damages, by
25       clear and convincing evidence, they get to get back

 1       up again and they get to argue more, argue more.
 2            And, by the way, if you answer this last
 3       question about punitive damages "yes," your work
 4       doesn't end.  You have another session.  We go on,
 5       we present more argument, more evidence, more
 6       argument.  So your work won't be done.
 7            I sit down, Mr. Engram stands up.  He makes his
 8       closing argument, then they get back up, they make
 9       more closing argument.  I don't know what they're
10       going to say.  They may show you more documents,
11       they may show you -- I don't know -- I don't know
12       what they're going to say.
13            All I know is I don't get to get back up after
14       that and to walk you through a timeline and to show
15       you what the evidence really was.  I don't have
16       that -- I don't get to put more quotes from the
17       actual transcript up on the Elmo.  So I would just
18       ask that while they're up making their what they
19       call rebuttal argument that you think to yourself,
20       So what does that have to do with Eveline Warrick?
21       Did that truly -- is that really connected to her?
22       Did it really impact her?  Did he really show an
23       impact? 24            It reminds me -- it reminds me of -- and I'm
25       going to use the word "you," but I don't mean you.

 1       It reminds me of when you're asked to -- you have a
 2       son who's in the fourth grade.  That's what I
 3       remember is when Little League starts.  And they
 4       don't have a coach for the team, and so they ask
 5       you -- not you -- they ask you if you will coach the
 6       team.
 7            You weren't all that red hot at baseball
 8       anyway, right?  But you say, "Sure."
 9            So you hold your first practice.  And you
10       gather your team, and you watch them throw, catch,
11       bat, hit the ball.  You got to pick your lineup,
12       right?  You got to figure out who's going to play
13       where.
14            So you watch kids, you see who can throw, who
15       can catch, who can bat, and you build your lineup.
16       And then you go to your first game.  And you -- one
17       of the little boys you have, you think to yourself,
18       Well, you know what?  I watched him bat, and I
19       thought he was pretty good, and so I'm going to put
20       him in my lineup pretty low on the order, second,
21       third.
22            What you didn't realize is that he has never
23       played in an organized game where there's another
24       team on the other side.  And so he's never
25       experienced that thing that happens when a pitcher

 1       is pitching and the opposing team is out in the
 2       field.
 3            Now, I don't know if this still happens, but as
 4       the pitcher starts to pitch, the team out in the
 5       field invariably goes -- you probably heard it --
 6       "Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter, batter."
 7            And as the ball goes across the plate, what do
 8       they yell?  They yell, "Swing," right?
 9            Now, he's never played in a game before, so he
10       doesn't know that that's going to happen.  So you
11       know what happens.  Three pitches, three swings, he
12       took his eye completely off the ball, right?  He
13       missed it by a mile.  He gets up three times.  He
14       strikes out three times.
15            And now you have your next practice and you
16       have to say to yourself, Okay.  What am I going to
17       do about this little boy?  And so what you do is you
18       put him in the batter's box and you take the bat out
19       of his hand.
20            You have a dad on the mound, your own team out
21       in the field, and you have the dad pitch.  And you
22       have your own team do that chant, "Hey, batter
23       batter, batter, batter."
24            Now, he doesn't have a bat in his hand, so all
25       he can do is stand there.  But, you know, from the

 1       first three or four pitches he flinches.  He doesn't
 2       even have a bat, but he still flinches because
 3       they're yelling, "Swing."
 4            But, finally, whether it's three pitches, four
 5       pitches, five pitches, who remembers?  But, finally,
 6       he starts to just watch the ball, right?  He starts
 7       to just watch the ball.
 8            Now, I'm not saying that you turn him into Alex  9       Rodriguez.  I'm just saying you taught him how to
10       watch the ball, right?
11            So that's all I'm asking you to do is, after I
12       sit down, after Mr. Engram sits down, whatever they
13       come up and say, please, just keep your eye on the
14       ball and I'm giving you the bat back.
15            THE COURT:  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm
16       going to ask you to step in the jury room for about
17       five minutes.  We need to change the setup in the --
18       with the technical stuff, so we'll be in short
19       recess about five minutes.


25            MR. ENGRAM:  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to

 1       thank you, too, for the hard work that you've been
 2       doing, the fact that you've been away from your
 3       families and your jobs and your school.  But your
 4       service is what makes this system that we have in
 5       this great country work.  And Mr. Latham and I both
 6       very much appreciate your willingness to serve these
 7       now more than three weeks.
 8            I want to talk about two basic things this
 9       afternoon, the cause of Mrs. Warrick's death and
10       about the work that the scientists and other
11       employees at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company have been
12       doing over the last 60 years.
13            And I want to do that in the context of some of
14       the things that were promised to you in opening
15       statements and in the context of some of the
16       testimony, whether it was live or by videotape that
17       you heard from the witness stand, as well as some of
18       the evidence that you'll have back with you in the
19       jury room when you begin your deliberations. 20            But, as a preliminary matter, I make three
21       observations.  Let's see.  And, as some people say,
22       opening statements are like a roadmap to the case.
23       Well, I like to think of closing arguments as a
24       report card for the case.  Did the attorneys come
25       through in the promises they made to you in opening

 1       statements?
 2            You know, one of the things that we look at is,
 3       during the course of a trial that's as long as this
 4       one has been, you know, there were some days that I
 5       wondered, Were we trying the same case?  Were we
 6       trying the same case that the plaintiffs were
 7       putting on?  And wonder if any of you-all wondered
 8       the same thing.
 9            Mr. Reilly and I told you in our opening
10       statements what this case was about.  We told you it
11       was about Mrs. Warrick, about what she knew about
12       the risks of smoking; it's about the choices that
13       Mrs. Warrick made; it's about what diseases or
14       conditions Mrs. Warrick had; and, lastly, it's about
15       what caused her death.  And that has been the case
16       that Mr. Reilly and I have tried over the last three
17       weeks.
18            The plaintiff, on the other hand, has spent
19       very little time talking about Mrs. Warrick.
20       Instead they've attempted to retry that first Engle
21       Class Action.
22            Her attorneys have put on generic or general
23       experts, who knew nothing about Mrs. Warrick, in an
24       effort to prove their case of general company
25       conduct, to prove the case of some unknown

 1       plaintiff, and certainly not the case about
 2       Mrs. Warrick, a case those general experts knew
 3       nothing about.
 4            Mrs. Warrick knew nothing about the Frank
 5       Statement.  Mrs. Warrick knew nothing about the
 6       company documents, and Mrs. Warrick knew nothing
 7       about the specific ads that you were shown.
 8            But let's go back to this third key observation
 9       about this case.  Plaintiffs put on their evidence
10       over the course of nine different days, from that
11       first Friday afternoon, when the plaintiff started
12       to play Dr. Burns' videotaped deposition, until last
13       Wednesday morning at -- or at the noon hour when the
14       plaintiff rested their case after Dr. Goldberg
15       testified.
16            And I'm certain that you-all are glad that we
17       put on our case in two-and-a-half days.  But I want
18       to remind you, this last point, that the defendants
19       put on part of their case through the plaintiff's
20       witnesses.  Through the cross-examination of
21       plaintiff's witnesses, we established evidence which
22       we believe proves our case.
23            So my point is that in putting on defendants'
24       case, don't just think about the witnesses who
25       testified Wednesday afternoon, Thursday afternoon

 1       and Friday, but think about also what the
 2       plaintiff's witnesses said when Mr. Reilly or
 3       Mr. Latham or I were cross-examining them.  And I'll
 4       try to highlight some of those things that a few of  5       those witnesses said.
 6            So let's talk about the evidence you heard on
 7       the cause of Mrs. Warrick's death.  It was a long
 8       time ago, but do you remember the plaintiffs in
 9       their opening statement, they told you that
10       Mrs. Warrick's death was caused by her cancer or her
11       cancer treatment.  But during this trial they
12       changed their theory in this case to suggest that
13       Mrs. Warrick died from both her COPD and her cancer.
14            They had Dr. Bagnoli testify that Mrs. Warrick
15       died from both diseases, although he couldn't tell
16       you how either of these diseases caused her death.
17            Now, remember, when I asked Dr. Rubin, their
18       pathologist, Dr. Rubin never said, "COPD caused
19       Mrs. Warrick's death."
20            And Dr. Nurani, the radiation oncologist who
21       testified by videotape, he never said that COPD
22       caused Mrs. Warrick's death.
23            And Dr. Shuman, the medical examiner from
24       Miami-Dade County said that Mrs. Warrick's COPD had
25       been stable for many years.

 1            And what did the autopsy show?  Well, the
 2       autopsy showed that her lungs were free of the
 3       pneumonia that she had been hospitalized for and
 4       she'd not been complaining about any worsening in
 5       her ability to breathe in the days before she died.
 6            I don't know why they changed their theory on
 7       how Mrs. Warrick died in the middle of the trial.
 8       But we spent a lot of time talking to you about
 9       what, in fact, caused Mrs. Warrick's death.
10            Mr. Reilly and I brought you evidence and
11       testimony that Mrs. Warrick's death was caused by
12       this grossly enlarged heart that led to her
13       arrhythmia.  Or irregular heartbeat.
14            Now, remember, this is a case that the
15       plaintiffs have the burden of proof.  And this is a
16       case where you have a verdict form.
17            Alecia, could you bring up -- the verdict form
18       up?
19            The verdict form has four questions on it, but
20       only two questions relate to the cause of death:
21       "Was Eveline Warrick's lung cancer a legal cause of
22       her death?"  "Was Eveline Warrick's COPD a legal
23       cause of her death?"
24            The plaintiffs -- Mr. Shields, in his closing,
25       suggested to you that there would be a fifth

 1       question.  He said, "Or was it something else that
 2       caused her death?"
 3            There's no question that you have to answer
 4       whether there was something else that caused her
 5       death.  And that's because the defendants don't have
 6       the burden of proving to you that something else
 7       caused her death.  The plaintiff's have the burden
 8       of proving to you that lung cancer caused her death
 9       or COPD caused her death.
10            And in this case there's no question but that
11       Mrs. Warrick died from heart disease.
12            There were three witnesses who talked about
13       whether Mrs. Warrick died when her heart stopped
14       beating, when it went into this sudden cardiac
15       arrest.  Those three witnesses are Dr. Rubin, the 16       pathologist from Philadelphia, Dr. Bishopric, the
17       cardiologist from the University of Miami School of
18       Medicine, and Dr. Shuman, the medical examiner and
19       forensic pathologist, from Miami-Dade County.
20            Now, do you remember in Mr. Shields' closing?
21       He said, "The defendants didn't call the autopsy
22       doctor.  And the defendants didn't call the
23       Jacksonville cardiologist."  It's not our burden of
24       proof to call the autopsy doctor or the -- or her
25       Jacksonville cardiologist.

 1            And who did -- who did they call?  They called
 2       a pathologist from Philadelphia.  They didn't call
 3       the autopsy doctor.  They didn't call the
 4       cardiologist who treated Mrs. Warrick.  And they
 5       didn't even put into evidence the autopsy report
 6       that Norma Warrick asked be conducted.
 7            You will get that.  It will be an exhibit, and
 8       it's marked as a defendants' exhibit in this case.
 9       They didn't bring you all the facts in an effort to
10       prove their case on that verdict form, their burden
11       of proof on the cause of death.
12            Let's talk about Dr. Rubin.  I think there were
13       three key points we made on cross-examination of
14       Dr. Rubin.  And these were things that while I was
15       asking him the questions it made me stop and think,
16       Did I really hear Dr. Rubin say that?
17            Let's look at these three points.  Dr. Rubin --
18       do you remember, one of the first questions I asked
19       him was, "You disagree with the death certificate on
20       the immediate cause of death?"  And he said -- he
21       said, "Yes, that's correct."
22            And I started to walk him through the death
23       certificate, because this was the first Florida
24       death certificate that he had ever reviewed.  And I
25       asked him, "What does PEA arrest mean?"

 1            Alecia?
 2            Here's the testimony.
 3            "In fact, the Florida form -- is this the first
 4       Florida death certificate you reviewed, Dr. Rubin?"
 5            Answer:  "That's correct."
 6            Question:  "Well, let me walk you through the
 7       Florida form.  The Florida form lists on Line A the
 8       immediate cause of death.  And on Line A doesn't it
 9       read "PEA arrest"?
10            Answer:  "Yes."
11            And my question.  I began it as a statement,
12       but I turned it into a question.  "And PEA stands
13       for -- well, do you know what PEA stands for?"
14            And his answer was:  "Don't recall."
15            I told him, "PEA stands for pulseless
16       electrical activity.  Are you familiar with that
17       term, Dr. Rubin?"
18            And his answer was:  "No."
19            They brought you someone here to challenge the
20       cause of death on the death certificate and the
21       autopsy report.  And this doctor from Philadelphia
22       didn't even know what the cause of death listed on
23       the death certificate was.
24            Don't you think that an expert is going to
25       disagree with the doctor at Shands on the cause of
5147  1       death, that before he offers a different opinion, he
 2       ought to at least know what that doctor meant when
 3       he wrote "PEA arrest" as the immediate cause of
 4       death?
 5            That Dr. Rubin -- the second key point that I
 6       think we made on cross-examination with Dr. Rubin
 7       related to heart disease.  And Dr. Rubin said that
 8       "In spite of the fact that 300,000 people die each
 9       year of sudden cardiac arrest, you can't call this
10       hypertensive heart disease if she had other causes
11       such as coronary artery disease that contributed to
12       her enlarged heart."
13            And these questions that I asked him came
14       toward the end of my cross-examination of Dr. Rubin.
15            Dr. Rubin didn't recall that Mrs. Warrick had a
16       cardiac catheterization back in May of 2001.  And do
17       you remember what that cardiac catheterization
18       showed?  It showed that her coronary arteries were
19       normal and free of disease.  And these were the same
20       three arteries that on the autopsy report had showed
21       50 percent and 30 percent and 30 percent blockage,
22       but that these same arteries were normal in May of
23       2001.
24            And the next question I asked Dr. Rubin was,
25       "What had happened six months before Mrs. Warrick

 1       had the normal coronary artery test in May of 2001?"
 2            And he didn't know.  He thought she must have
 3       had some chest pains or some reason to have this
 4       test.
 5            But you know.  You know what happened to
 6       Mrs. Warrick in November of 2000, because
 7       Thanksgiving, November of 2000, Mrs. Warrick quit
 8       smoking.  She had quit smoking for six months.  And
 9       six months later her coronary arteries were
10       completely normal.  So smoking had nothing to do
11       with the coronary artery blockage that was found on
12       autopsy later on.
13            And then the third point that I think we made
14       in Dr. Rubin's testimony was that he -- his opinion
15       is that "The precise cause of death in cases of
16       metastatic cancer is not often apparent at autopsy.
17       And if it's not apparent at autopsy, then it should
18       just be attributed to the cancer which had spread."
19            You know, this sounds an awful lot like
20       guessing to me, ladies and gentlemen.  You know,
21       it's kind of like reaching a cause of death by
22       default.  If -- if we can't see it in cases of
23       metastatic cancer but she had cancer and the cancer
24       had spread, then by default you simply say, "It must
25       have been the lung cancer."

 1            Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's not proof of
 2       their case that lung cancer caused her death.
 3            Remember what Dr. Shuman told you about
 4       Mrs. Warrick's cancer at her autopsy?  What did he
 5       say about cancer in her lungs?  She had lung cancer,
 6       but chemotherapy had resolved all of the lung
 7       cancer.  She had no cancer in her lungs at the time
 8       she died.
 9            The tumor -- Dr. Shuman said the tumor in her
10       liver was stable.  And when I asked Dr. Rubin about
11       the amount of tumor, he talked about the fact that 12       there were small nodules of cancer in the liver,
13       what did Dr. Rubin tell you?  Dr. Rubin said that it
14       was only two-and-a-half percent of her liver that
15       was involved with the metastatic cancer, the cancer
16       that had spread there, and that she needs to have 70
17       percent of the tumor involved for there to be any
18       impairment of liver function.
19            So we don't have her liver shutting down.  We
20       don't have any impairment or dysfunction of the
21       liver, not with two-and-a-half percent.
22            What about the tumor that was found in the
23       brain?  Nobody knew she had any spread of cancer to
24       the brain until after she was dead.  The PET scans
25       were negative, and they found only microscopic

 1       tumors in the brain.
 2            She had no symptoms.  She had no stumbling or
 3       speech or vision -- no impairments that would
 4       indicate that the tumor was in any way affecting her
 5       brain function.
 6            And so this idea that Dr. -- that Dr. Rubin
 7       determined the cause of death when it wasn't
 8       apparent at autopsy and just by default suggested it
 9       was the cancer, ladies and gentlemen, doesn't meet
10       the plaintiff's burden of proof in this case.
11            You know, perhaps Dr. Rubin is good at editing
12       textbooks, but you've heard that he'd only done one
13       autopsy, one autopsy since 1962.
14            Defendants' forensic pathologist, Dr. Shuman,
15       has done 2500 autopsies in the last 15 years.
16            Now, there were some things that Dr. Rubin did
17       specifically say about Mrs. Warrick's heart that we
18       can agree on.  Mrs. -- Dr. Rubin said -- and these
19       were the things that I told you in our opening that
20       we would show.  Mrs. Warrick had an enlarged heart.
21       He agreed with that.  He agreed because the autopsy
22       showed Mrs. Warrick's heart weighed 650 grams.  He
23       also agreed that the normal weight for a women's
24       heart was 300 grams.
25            He also agreed -- remember we talked about

 1       hypertrophic heart disease?  Hypertrophic is the
 2       medical term for enlarged.  And Dr. Rubin agreed
 3       that high blood pressure can cause hypertrophic
 4       heart disease, or an enlarged heart.
 5            He also agreed that her weight contributed to
 6       her enlarged heart and that in the medical records
 7       that he had reviewed she'd weighed over 200 pounds
 8       up until April of 2009.
 9            What did the slides that Dr. Rubin reviewed and
10       the slides that Dr. Shuman took pictures of and
11       brought to you -- well, those slides showed that
12       Mrs. Warrick's heart was filled with scar tissue and
13       fat at autopsy, that Dr. Rubin also said that
14       genetic factors can play a role in an enlarged
15       heart, and he also agreed that enlarged hearts are
16       more vulnerable to arrhythmias.  And, finally,
17       Dr. Rubin agreed that smoking cigarettes does not
18       cause hypertensive heart disease that leads to
19       enlarged hearts.
20            Let's talk about Dr. Shuman.  What did
21       Dr. Shuman do to determine the cause and manner of
22       death?  And, remember, that's what a forensic, or 23       autopsy, pathologist does.  He or she determines the
24       cause and manner of death.  A forensic pathologist
25       has additional training specifically in the area of

 1       determining cause and manner of death.
 2            And remember that Dr. Rubin was not a forensic
 3       pathologist.
 4            Dr. Shuman said that a medical examiner
 5       determines the chain of events that lead to death.
 6       And in Mrs. Warrick's case there were basically
 7       three links in the chain of events that led to
 8       Mrs. Warrick's death.
 9            Dr. Shuman said Mrs. Warrick had longstanding
10       high blood pressure.  You remember when Mr. Shields
11       cross-examined Dr. Shuman and he took blood pressure
12       readings from that last 17-day hospitalization in
13       January of 2010, earlier this year?
14            He didn't go back.  And so I went back on
15       redirect with Dr. Shuman, and in every year prior to
16       that time, Mrs. Warrick had elevated, uncontrolled
17       high blood pressure readings.
18            Now, did they get better as she lost weight, as
19       she came down from 285 pounds to the -- to less than
20       200 pounds in the months before she died?  Yes.  But
21       these records showed that Dr. -- that Dr. Shuman
22       noted these records showed that she had high blood
23       pressure readings of 140 over 90 or higher her
24       entire life.
25            Link Number 2 in the chain of events.  She had

 1       this enlarged -- Dr. Shuman called it massively
 2       enlarged heart; 650 grams, more than twice the size
 3       of a normal woman's heart.
 4            What did he say about enlarged hearts?  He said
 5       that they're "electrically unstable and," like
 6       Dr. Rubin, "they're more vulnerable to arrhythmias."
 7            And what do we know about Mrs. Warrick's
 8       arrhythmias?  Well, she had -- this isn't the first
 9       time she had an arrhythmia.  She had progressively
10       worsening arrhythmias going back to 2001.  And I'll
11       go through some of those records in a moment.
12            But you remember it.  You remember the halter
13       monitor.  You remember the loop recorder.  You
14       remember the pacemaker.  Every one of those devices
15       was designed to identify the irregular heartbeats
16       that Mrs. Warrick had.
17            And, finally, the final event, or the last link
18       in this chain of events, was the ventricular
19       fibrillation, the V-fib.  And you have the
20       Jacksonville Fire and Rescue reports in evidence to
21       review.  And those will tell you, she had no pulse,
22       she was not breathing, and that this had been going
23       on for a period of 20 minutes when they arrived.
24            But what did they find when they put those pads
25       on her to defibrillate her?  They found that she did

 1       have a rhythm of ventricular fibrillation.
 2            Do you remember how Dr. Shuman described what
 3       ventricular fibrillation looks like when the -- when
 4       the heart is in V-fib?  He said it's quivering.
 5       "Quivering" is the word that he used to describe it.
 6            Dr. Bishopric said that V-fib -- that the heart
 7       looks like it's wriggling like a bag of worms.  If  8       anybody's been fishing and had a plastic bag of
 9       worms, you got a pretty good idea of what that looks
10       like.
11            And you'll also note in that Fire and Rescue
12       Report that the Jacksonville EMS called it -- her
13       condition cardiac rhythm disturbance.  It doesn't
14       say lung cancer.  Doesn't say COPD.  It says,
15       "Cardiac rhythm disturbance."
16            Let's take a look now at those records going
17       back to 2001 on abnormal heart rhythms.  In 2001 she
18       had the first instance of premature supraventricular
19       complexes.  And Dr. Shuman pointed that out and said
20       these were abnormal beats coming from the top part
21       of the heart.  In 2007 she had the halter monitor
22       that she wore, and Dr. Bishopric described that as
23       an external monitor, or like an external EKG
24       machine, and that showed a couple of things.
25            We didn't blow this up, but it showed that she

 1       was having sinus bradycardia.  And bradycardia is an
 2       arrhythmia.  It's a "slowing of the heart"
 3       contractions.  And, more importantly, it said this
 4       halter monitor computer recorded 1,310 isolated,
 5       premature ventricular contractions over the 24-hour
 6       period that she wore it.  You're not supposed to
 7       have any premature ventricular contractions.
 8            We know, too, that by 2009, in June of 2009,
 9       she was having these fainting spells.  She fainted
10       and hit her head in the bathtub, and her doctors
11       wanted to find out what the cause of her fainting
12       was.
13            So let's look at one of Dr. Bagnoli's records.
14       And what did he say about this on June 16th or 17th
15       of 2009?  He said that she was having "recurrent,
16       syncopal episodes of unclear etiology.  Need to
17       consider cardiac dysrhythmia."
18            Well, let me -- "recurring syncopal," syncopal
19       is fainting, "episodes of unclear etiology."
20       Etiology is cause.  So he's saying, "We don't know
21       what the cause is, but she's having recurring
22       fainting spells."  And -- and he's telling the other
23       doctors who are caring for Mrs. Warrick that they
24       need to consider cardiac dysrhythmias.
25            And so what did they do?  We've gone -- had the

 1       halter monitor, and now we go to the loop recorder.
 2       And the loop recorder -- remember Dr. Bishopric
 3       described what the loop recorder was.  She called it
 4       a little, tiny EKG machine that you put -- they
 5       place under your skin.  You can wear it longer than
 6       a halter monitor, and it allows the patient to
 7       shower.  You can't shower with a halter monitor.
 8            And what did Mrs. Warrick's loop recorder show
 9       with respect to her heartbeats?  Well, here's the
10       cardiologist with Baker Gilmore Cardiovascular
11       Institute.  And they noted that when Mrs. Warrick
12       underwent the placement of the loop recorder, in an
13       effort to document cardiac rhythm during any further
14       episodes, fainting episodes, when they examined the
15       device, it was found that she was having spells of
16       asystole of greater than three seconds.
17            Now, asystole -- Dr. Bishopric told you and
18       Dr. Shuman told you, that there was no cardiac 19       electrical activity.  Her heart stopped beating.  I
20       did that in openings.  I asked you to put your hand
21       on your heart and feel your heartbeat and imagine
22       what it would be like for you to sit there for three
23       seconds and not feel any heartbeat.
24            Mrs. Warrick had a severely diseased heart to
25       have these kind of arrhythmias from -- for the last

 1       nine years of her life.
 2            And so as a result of these periods where her
 3       heart stopped beating for up to three seconds, her
 4       doctors took out the loop recorder and replaced it
 5       with a pacemaker.
 6            Now, Mr. Shields in his closing claimed that
 7       Dr. Bishopric and Dr. Shuman had different opinions
 8       on the cause of Mrs. Warrick's death.
 9            And let's go back to the -- Dr. Shuman's three
10       links in the chain of events for a moment, Alecia.
11            The last link in this chain of events, the
12       terminal event, the final -- the final link in the
13       chain of events, there's no dispute.  Dr. Shuman and
14       Dr. Bishopric both agree that ventricular
15       fibrillation, V-fib, was the final link in the chain
16       of events leading up to Mrs. Warrick's death.  So
17       there's no dispute about Link Number 3.
18            Dr. Shuman and Bishopric both testified,
19       Dr. Rubin testified, that Mrs. Warrick had this
20       massively enlarged heart.  There's no dispute about
21       Link Number 2, "massively enlarged, diseased,
22       electrically unstable heart."
23            So let's look at this first link in the chain
24       of events.  Remember, not only did Dr. Shuman note
25       all of Mrs. Warrick's weight measurements, he also

 1       noted all of her high blood pressure readings in
 2       every year from -- there was some -- there was some
 3       information from 1982 and then from every year from
 4       1998 to April of 2009.
 5            Dr. Bishopric was asked by Mr. Reilly, "What
 6       causes the human heart to get so big like that?"
 7       And Dr. Bishopric said, "There were several causes."
 8       And she said -- think back to Dr. Bishopric being on
 9       the stand.  She said, "There are several causes.
10       Some of them are common like" -- and what was the
11       first one she listed?  High blood pressure.  "Some
12       of them are common like high blood pressure."
13            She said, "You can have obstructions or
14       blockages to the heart valves."  Well, Dr. Shuman
15       ruled that out.  Dr. Shuman found no obstruction or
16       blockage to the heart valves at autopsy.
17            And Dr. Bishopric said that some are less
18       common, like genetic factors.  But there was no
19       testing of Mrs. Warrick's heart muscle to determine
20       whether she had any of these genetic factors.
21            And there's no dispute between Dr. Bishopric,
22       Dr. Shuman, even Dr. Rubin, that the heart muscle,
23       as Dr. Bishopric said, had a lot of stuff in it that
24       shouldn't have been in there, stuff like fibrous
25       tissue, gristle, fat that weren't normal.

 1            Now, did Dr. Bishopric say it couldn't all be
 2       explained by high blood pressure?  Sure.  Did she
 3       say she didn't know which one of these it was?  4       Sure.  But she said the most common one was high
 5       blood pressure.  And the thing we do know about
 6       Mrs. Warrick is that she had high blood pressure.
 7            Don't be fooled, ladies and gentlemen, by
 8       Mr. Shields' suggestion that it was ludicrous for
 9       Dr. Bishopric to give an opinion in this case and
10       that that opinion was different from Dr. Shuman's.
11       They are both saying she had an enlarged, diseased,
12       electronically unstable heart that led to the
13       ventricular fibrillation and arrhythmia that caused
14       her death.
15            You know, Dr. Bishopric was asked, "What does
16       having this fat and gristle in your heart do to the
17       performance of the heart?"  And in Mrs. Warrick, she
18       said what was really dangerous about it is that it
19       can affect the way the electrical currents run
20       through the heart.  And people with this type of
21       picture have dangerous problems with their heart
22       rhythm.
23            You know, Dr. Bishopric was also asked a
24       question going back to our verdict form.  And the
25       question was:  "Did this chaotic rhythm, had it been

 1       brought on by or have anything to do with her lung
 2       cancer or her COPD?"
 3            And do you remember what she said?  She said,
 4       "I don't see a clear connection.  I think that
 5       there's enough evidence that her muscle was diseased
 6       to explain how this happened."
 7            And don't forget that Dr. Bishopric's final
 8       opinion was -- when asked the question, "Do you have
 9       an opinion as to why Mrs. Warrick died on the day
10       she did?"  She said, "Yes.  It's a factual matter
11       she had a lethal ventricular arrhythmia documented
12       when the emergency technicians arrived."
13            And you've seen that -- you've seen that
14       record.
15            Alecia, let's bring up the February 7 EMS
16       record.
17            "On initial contact, there were no pulses with
18       a V-fib rhythm.  Primary impression:  Cardiac
19       arrest.  Secondary impression:  Cardiac rhythm
20       disturbance."  Nothing about lung cancer, nothing
21       about metastatic cancer, nothing about COPD.
22            Remember what the autopsy report showed, March
23       7th, 2010.  It showed she had hypertrophy of the
24       heart, or enlarged heart; 650 grams with large
25       amounts of pericardial fat and extensive fat

 1       infiltration of the left and right ventricles and
 2       myocardial interstitial fibrosis.
 3            And what does it look like?  Here's the
 4       photomicrograph.  And remember Dr. Shuman explained.
 5       This is the fat.  This is the layer of fat that
 6       surrounded the heart.  And these were areas of
 7       inflammation in the cells.  The cells of the muscle
 8       in the heart, themselves, were abnormal.
 9            You'll have these medical records and these
10       photomicrographs, the pictures of Mrs. Warrick's
11       diseased heart, with you when you retire to the jury
12       room to begin your deliberations.
13            And nothing in the autopsy report will suggest
14       to you that Mrs. Warrick died from her cancer or 15       from her COPD.  And so on that verdict form, we
16       would ask that you answer the questions on cause of
17       death, "No."
18            Now, remember what this case is all about,
19       ladies and gentlemen.  It's about the choices that
20       Mrs. Warrick made.  It's about the fact that she was
21       morbidly obese.  That's what her doctors called it.
22            It's a fact -- it's about the fact that she had
23       high and uncontrollable blood pressure for many
24       years.  And it's about the fact that she had this
25       massively enlarged heart that caused her to have

 1       abnormal heartbeats and at times that caused her
 2       heart to stop beating completely.
 3            And it was the -- this disease, these abnormal
 4       heartbeats, that caused her heart to stop beating
 5       suddenly on February 7th of 2010, when she was found
 6       by the Fire and Rescue to be in V-fib, not breathing
 7       and with no pulse.
 8            Those are the chain of events that caused her
 9       death on February 7th, 2010, not the cigarettes that
10       she smoked until she quit smoking almost ten years
11       ago on Thanksgiving Day, 2000.
12            When I started my closing, I told you I wanted
13       to highlight some of the testimony that we elicited
14       on cross-examination of plaintiff's experts.  And I
15       want to talk -- we've talked about Dr. Rubin, but I
16       want to talk about Dr. Burns and Dr. Proctor and
17       Dr. Farone, about the research that was conducted by
18       R.J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson and American
19       Tobacco Company over the last 30 years.
20            You remember when Dr. Proctor testified?  The
21       plaintiffs in this case have introduced a few
22       documents from what Dr. Proctor described as 60
23       million pages of internal tobacco company documents.
24            Now, I went through the list of plaintiff's
25       admitted exhibits, and there are 22 documents from

 1       R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and American
 2       Tobacco Company, internal company documents admitted
 3       into evidence in this case; 22 documents out of 60
 4       million pages.
 5            And look where they come from.  There's one
 6       document here from Reynolds from the 1920s.  There's
 7       nothing from the '30s or '40s that they introduced.
 8       And then in the 1950s there are seven -- seven
 9       different documents.
10            For example, you may remember the document that
11       Dr. Claude Teague wrote in 1953.  Remember about
12       that document.  Dr. Teague did a literature search
13       of the public literature when he was identifying
14       carcinogens in cigarette smoke; public literature
15       available in the library.
16            These weren't studies that were internal to
17       R.J. Reynolds that they were somehow hiding from the
18       public.  He simply reported the public literature in
19       1953.
20            You know, we come through this list, and it
21       ends in the 1980s of the Reynolds, American, Brown &
22       Williamson documents in the case.  The last one is
23       1983, 27 years ago.  Some of you -- I think this is
24       right.  Some of you weren't even born 27 years ago.
25            But what about some of the Reynolds employees 5164
 1       who wrote these documents?  You remember the names,
 2       Dr. Claude Teague, Dr. Alan Rodgman, Dr. Frank
 3       Colby.  Did Dr. Proctor tell you that Dr. Colby is
 4       dead?  Did Dr. Proctor tell you that Claude Teague
 5       and Alan Rodgman have long since retired from
 6       R.J. Reynolds?
 7            You might expect that, given that we're dealing
 8       with documents from the '50s and the '60s and the
 9       '70s and the early '80s.
10            And we didn't call these people -- we didn't
11       call Dr. Teague or Dr. Rodgman to come in and defend
12       themselves or defend what they wrote.  That was a
13       different time.  That was long ago.  And some of
14       those things that these people wrote we would not
15       agree with then, we would not agree with today.
16            You remember one of the papers from the '70s
17       that Mr. Shields used; actually was a draft.  It was
18       about youth marketing and whether there was
19       marketing information and whether the segment that
20       had been marketed was from 14-year-olds to
21       24-year-olds, or was it from 18-year-olds to
22       24-year-olds.
23            And in the final version of the document, the
24       document that got circulated with the cover sheet
25       and the distribution list, there was no mention of

 1       14- to 18-year-olds.
 2            So we addressed a lot of those documents.  I
 3       want to talk about some things that Dr. Burns
 4       testified to on cross-examination.  Remember, the
 5       defendants put on part of their case through
 6       cross-examination of the plaintiff's own experts.
 7            Let's look at the broader picture about the
 8       research that Reynolds and American and Brown &
 9       Williamson were doing over the years.
10            Dr. Burns admitted on cross-examination that
11       the Council for Tobacco Research, or CTR, funded
12       grants for outside researchers, not just inside
13       company scientists.  And, in fact, many of them were
14       distinguished scientists from the -- from
15       universities all over the country, top universities.
16            Some of this research, some of these studies
17       were co-funded by public health groups like the
18       American Cancer Society and the National Cancer
19       Institute.  And so when you looked at the published
20       study, it would say, "The funding was provided by
21       the Council for Tobacco Research, the National
22       Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society."
23            And how many of these articles -- you know,
24       they want you to believe that it was a front or a
25       shield simply because that appeared in one document

 1       out of 60 million pages.  But the fact of the
 2       matter -- Dr. Burns admits hundreds of CTR articles
 3       were published in the peer-reviewed literature.
 4       Hundreds were cited in the Surgeon General's
 5       reports.  That's evidence that the literature was
 6       sound, the science was good and it was worthy of
 7       publication and acknowledgment by the Surgeon
 8       General.
 9            And what else did Dr. Burns tell you?  He told
10       you that "More than 50 million Americans have quit 11       smoking."  He told you that "80 to 90 percent of
12       Americans who quit did so without assistance of any
13       smoking cessation aids."
14            You know, Dr. Burns, one of the things that he
15       said I think bears repeating.
16            Alecia?
17            He was asked, "You've said many times that
18       smokers are responsible for their own smoking
19       behavior, correct?"
20            Answer:  "That's correct."
21            Question:  "Even if they are addicted that
22       smokers are still responsible for their own smoking
23       behavior, correct?"
24            Answer:  "Yes, that's correct.  The fact that
25       someone is addicted is a barrier for behavioral

 1       change, but it doesn't free them from the
 2       responsibility for their behavior."
 3            If Dr. Burns had been a specific witness and
 4       not a general witness, Dr. Burns would have said,
 5       "It doesn't free Mrs. Warrick from responsibility
 6       for her behavior."
 7            You saw a video clip of the Surgeon General,
 8       C. Everett Koop, but what you didn't see was what
 9       Dr. Burns acknowledged, that Dr. Koop in the 1986
10       Surgeon General's Report wrote, "Cigarette smoking
11       is an addictive behavior and the individual smoker
12       must decide whether or not to continue that
13       behavior."
14            That's what Dr. -- Surgeon General Koop
15       believed in 1986 when they wrote that Surgeon
16       General's report.
17            You heard the testimony from Dr. Burns.  I
18       wanted you to see exactly what it was that Dr. Koop
19       had written.
20            Let's talk about Dr. Proctor and what he
21       admitted on cross-examination.
22            Again, Dr. Proctor says, "If either you or a
23       family member were diagnosed with COPD or lung
24       cancer and a doctor told you it was caused by
25       smoking, that should be a powerful source of

 1       information on the risks of smoking."
 2            And who did that happen to?  What -- who
 3       experienced that?  Mrs. Warrick experienced that
 4       when her sister was diagnosed with COPD, and she was
 5       in the office when the doctor told both of them.
 6            Dr. Proctor also said that some people treat
 7       cigarette warnings like they treated ads, they just
 8       didn't pay any attention to it.  That's a direct
 9       quote from Mrs. Warrick's testimony.
10            And remember that in 1964 the Surgeon General
11       thanked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and others for
12       the information that they provided in that -- that
13       big green book, the Larson -- edited by Larson, Haag
14       and Silvette, which chronicled all of the tobacco
15       research done up until 1964.
16            Now, Dr. Proctor said that filters don't reduce
17       the health risks.  You heard that testimony.  But he
18       also agreed that the World Health Organization, what
19       the plaintiffs called the Surgeon General for the
20       world, that they disagree with Dr. Proctor's opinion
21       that filters don't reduce the health risks of 22       smoking.
23            And what did the Surgeon General of the United
24       States say in 1975 and 1979 and 1981?  They reported
25       that smokers of filtered cigarettes were at a lower

 1       risk of developing lung cancer than smokers of
 2       non-filtered cigarettes.
 3            Dr. Proctor also admitted on
 4       cross-examination -- you know, we -- we didn't
 5       bring in an R.J. Reynolds scientist to tell you
 6       that in 1964 and in 1979 and in 1981 and in 1989,
 7       in 2000 in the Surgeon General's reports they
 8       cited research studies, published research studies
 9       conducted by scientists at R.J. Reynolds.  We
10       didn't need to because Dr. Proctor admitted that
11       in our cross-examination.
12            I'm almost finished.
13            The last one of plaintiff's expert witnesses I
14       want to talk about is Dr. Farone.  And if you'll
15       bear with me, there were a number of important
16       things that Dr. Farone admitted about RJR's research
17       efforts, their harm reduction, or general reduction,
18       the low tar and light cigarettes, and with respect
19       to R.J. Reynolds' conduct.
20            And so I want to take a look at Dr. Farone's
21       testimony and some of the things that Dr. Farone
22       admitted on cross-examination when Mr. Latham was
23       cross-examining him on that video.
24            Dr. Farone said, "There's no current government
25       standard for what constitutes a safer cigarette, nor

 1       has there ever been such a standard."  And you heard
 2       Mr. Jupe say, "There is no such thing as a safe
 3       cigarette."
 4            Dr. Farone said, "Reynolds has developed" --
 5       "has devoted a tremendous amount of financial
 6       resources and scientific talent to try to develop a
 7       safer cigarette, that they've been working on this
 8       since the 1950s, and that Reynolds, Brown &
 9       Williamson and the American Tobacco Company used
10       different techniques, including filtration or
11       filters, reconstituted tobacco, porous paper, filter
12       ventilation and expanded tobacco to reduce tar and
13       nicotine for its cigarette brands."
14            That was the same exhibit that Mr. Reilly went
15       over Mr. Jupe with, where he showed the parts of a
16       cigarette and how each one of those parts described
17       there were used to reduce the levels of tar and
18       nicotine in cigarettes, general reduction.
19            Next.
20            Okay.  And there's been a significant reduction
21       in tar yield from the cigarettes through the 1950s
22       to the cigarettes of today, a 70 percent reduction.
23       Is it safe?  No.  But is it safer?  Yes.
24            Reynolds looked at a lot of different materials
25       for the filters in an effort to reduce those

 1       carcinogens, those polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
 2       PAHs.  They -- they also treated their filters in an
 3       effort to reduce tumor promoters in smoke.
 4            And the first company to use reconstituted
 5       tobacco was R.J. Reynolds in their Camel cigarettes
 6       in the 1950s.  Brown & Williamson and American  7       Tobacco Company also used reconstituted tobacco.
 8            The result in the sheet-making process for
 9       reconstituted tobacco is that it lowers PAHs and
10       phenols compared to regular leaf tobacco.
11            It has lower tumorigenicity and found -- there
12       was a lot of talk about this National Cancer
13       Institute Tobacco Working Group.  Reynolds, Brown &
14       Williamson, American, Philip Morris were involved in
15       that effort to make cigarettes less tumorigenic.
16            American has used this process since the 1950s,
17       and the NCI Tobacco Working Group noted that the
18       reconstituted sheet tobacco was made by the Reynolds
19       method.
20            I mean, these are significant admissions by the
21       experts that the plaintiffs brought to you about the
22       good work that Reynolds' scientists and American
23       scientists and Brown & Williamson scientists and
24       Philip Morris scientists were doing.
25            We talked about porous paper, or porosity I

 1       think was in that diagram, the expanded tobacco.  We
 2       did have the couple of jars up here.  I don't know
 3       if they're going back with you in the jury room or
 4       not, but you saw the difference in the volume in the
 5       jars on the tobacco.
 6            Expanded tobacco is less tumorigenic than
 7       standard leaf tobacco.  And Reynolds used expanded
 8       tobacco across a wide range of its cigarettes.
 9            Here are four more areas.  And I've got another
10       10 or 15 that I could go through.
11            Let's skip forward to the Number 23, Alecia.
12            Okay.  "In 1976 the National Cancer Institute
13       concluded that filtered cigarettes are less
14       hazardous than non-filtered cigarettes and also
15       concluded that low-tar cigarettes are less hazardous
16       than high-tar cigarettes."
17            These are the types of documents that Reynolds
18       cigarette designers were reviewing when they were
19       trying to develop less hazardous cigarettes.
20            Let's talk a little bit about conduct.
21       Dr. Farone admitted in his cross-examination that
22       he never talked with anyone at Reynolds or Brown &
23       Williamson about this gentleman's agreement.  And
24       he acknowledged that Reynolds was doing in-house
25       biological research using intact animals in the

 1       1960s, not only in-house, but outside contract
 2       laboratories.  And then in the '70s and '80s they
 3       did biological testing in vitro.
 4            In 1972 what did Reynolds do?  Their R&D
 5       Department, their Research and Development
 6       Department, published a book on cigarette
 7       ingredients.  You know, there was some talk about --
 8       by Dr. Goldberg that you-all will list all the
 9       ingredients on the packages of cigarettes.
10            Well, Reynolds published a book on the
11       cigarette ingredients in 1972.  And then in 1986 the
12       cigarette companies disclosed a list of all
13       ingredients used in their cigarette, to Congress.
14            Now, this is an important admission by
15       Dr. Farone.  "The federal government has never told
16       the cigarette companies to remove any ingredient
17       from their products.  The Surgeon General hasn't 18       told us to do that.  The federal government hasn't
19       told us to do that."
20            Does that mean that Reynolds ignores the
21       ingredients in its products?  No.  Reynolds has
22       what's called a Product Stewardship Program.  And
23       this program's designed to make sure that as they
24       change their cigarettes, if there are changes to the
25       ingredients, that the toxicity of the smoke

 1       generated by its cigarettes isn't increased.  It's
 2       an effort to keep those tar levels, the toxicity
 3       levels, down to 70 percent from the 1950s.  And, of
 4       course, Dr. Farone supports those kind of programs.
 5            Ladies and gentlemen, today is August the 2nd,
 6       2010.  It's not 1953 or '56 or '59 or '62 or '73 or
 7       1978 or even 1983, like the documents that the
 8       plaintiffs introduced into evidence from Reynolds,
 9       Brown & Williamson and American.
10            You know, that's the case that they chose to
11       try the last three weeks.  Philip Morris and
12       R.J. Reynolds tried Mrs. Warrick's case these last
13       three weeks.  And on behalf of the 4,000 men and
14       women who work for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and
15       Mr. Latham and I, we want to thank you for listening
16       to the evidence, listening to the argument and for
17       your service on this jury.
18            Thank you.
