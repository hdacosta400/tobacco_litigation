14             MR. SHIELDS:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
15             THE JURORS:  Good morning.
16             MR. SHIELDS:  It was just before Christmas in 1953
17       when the presidents for the American Tobacco Companies
18       got together for a secret meeting at the Plaza Hotel in
19       New York City to decide what to do about the amount of
20       growing scientific evidence that cigarette smoking
21       caused lung cancer.  As a result --
22             THE COURT:  Excuse me.  Sorry.
23             MR. SHIELDS:  As a result of that meeting, they
24       proceeded to initiate and proceed with a decade's long
25       elaborate coordinated campaign of denial and deceit

 1       about cigarette smoking and disease, about the addictive
 2       nature of cigarettes.  That campaign continued through
 3       1994 when the presidents of those companies got up
 4       before congress and took an oath to tell the truth and
 5       swore under oath that cigarettes were not addictive and
 6       did not cause cancer.
 7             It was not until 1999 that they finally admitted
 8       the truth, when they put up on their website the
 9       admission that cigarettes caused various kinds of
10       cancer, heart disease and other disease and they finally
11       admitted that cigarettes were addictive.
12             Yet, their representative, Mr. Jupe, on behalf of
13       Philip Morris, comes into this court, as you saw him,
14       and claims that they did not know that cigarettes were a
15       cause of cancer or that cigarettes were addictive prior
16       to when they put it up on their website in 1999.
17             Despite that claim, they turn around in this suit
18       and try to blame Eveline Warrick for not quitting
19       sooner, claiming that she should have known that her
20       diseases were the result of cigarette smoking, claiming
21       that she should have known what they denied was true
22       until 1999.
23             Yes, this case is about choice and you will, no
24       doubt, hear a lot about that in closing argument, but it
25       is not just Evelyn's Warrick's choices, it was their

 1       choices as well.  They chose to engage in a campaign of
 2       denial and deceit for decades.  They've made that choice
 3       knowingly, fully informed, with all of the facts
 4       available to them and they chose to deny, to deceive, to
 5       conceal, to conspire, unlike her choices, which were not
 6       totally relevant, which was influenced by their massive
 7       advertising and marketing campaigns and by their addict
 8       -- by her addiction to their product, which they
 9       continued to sell to her as a safe product.
10             I want to begin this closing argument by thanking 11       you for your attention throughout this trial.  I know
12       it's been a long trial, but starting the fourth week, we
13       said it was only going to take three weeks, it's taking
14       a little longer than we anticipated.  And I want to
15       thank you on behalf of Norma Warrick, as the
16       representative of her mother's estate, on behalf of the
17       surviving spouse, Calvin Warrick, on behalf of my
18       co-counsel and my very hard-working staff in preparing
19       and trying this case for you.  We appreciate your
20       attention.  We appreciate your hard work.
21             Now is the time, as the court told you, in which
22       we are allowed to argue the case, pull everything
23       together and tell you what it means.  I suspect you
24       thought we were arguing the case throughout the trial by
25       the various battles that went on, but this is the formal

 1       time in which argument occurs.  And so what I'm going to
 2       do is walk through the issues and talk with you about
 3       what evidence has been put in in regard to each of those
 4       issues and where we think that leads to.
 5             Now, recall in opening statement I said there were
 6       four principal issues in this case and that gives us an
 7       outline of what we ought to be talking about in this
 8       closing argument.
 9             The first issue is class membership.  That is, did
10       Eveline Warrick suffer or die from disease caused by her
11       addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine manufactured
12       by these two defendants?  If so, she is a member of the
13       Engle class action and the findings from that prior jury
14       trial apply in this case.
15             And so the first issue I'm going to talk with you
16       in great detail about is her qualification for class
17       membership.
18             The second issue is specific causation.  And that
19       is did the defendants' misconduct cause or substantially
20       contribute to causing Eveline Warrick's injury and
21       death?  We'll talk about that in detail and what the
22       evidence shows.
23             Third, and an overriding issue in this phase of
24       the trial is comparative fault.  That is, under Florida
25       law the jury can allocate the responsibility, can

 1       allocate the fault, not only between the defendants, but
 2       between the defendants and the plaintiff.  And so one of
 3       the things you will need to do is determine what is the
 4       appropriate and reasonable allocation of fault in this
 5       case, what is called comparative fault.
 6             Fourth and finally, we're going to talk about
 7       damages and punitive damages and, particularly, whether
 8       the estate is entitled under Florida law to recover
 9       punitive damages.  Okay.  We will offer some help to you
10       by what instruction the court will give you about
11       entitlement to punitive damages.
12             So let's begin then with the first issue.  Class
13       membership.  This is the beginning and fundamental issue
14       in the case.  The court's going to instruct you that if
15       you find that Eveline Warrick was a member of the Engle
16       class, then she's entitled to the benefit of the prior
17       jury's findings, that those findings, you recall I set
18       those findings out for you in opening statement, would
19       be conclusive here, that is, this jury would be bound by
20       the prior jury's findings.  Class membership is simply a
21       question of whether she suffered from chronic 22       obstructive pulmonary disease caused by her addiction to
23       cigarettes.
24             Now, note that I said chronic obstructive
25       pulmonary disease and I did not -- did not say both

 1       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.
 2       There's a reason for that.  And that is, in order to be
 3       a member of the class, she had to have a smoking-related
 4       disease at the time that class action was filed in 1994.
 5       And the only disease she had in 1994 was chronic
 6       obstructive pulmonary disease.  The lung cancer did not
 7       occur until 2009.
 8             I will separately talk about whether she is still
 9       entitled to recover for damages for lung cancer, but
10       this initial question, that is, whether she's a member
11       of the class, is a question about whether her chronic
12       obstructive pulmonary disease is the result of her
13       addiction to cigarettes.
14             So let's talk about addiction.  The first part of
15       the class membership issue is whether she was addicted
16       to cigarettes containing nicotine.  We started this
17       discussion by offering you the testimony of Dr. David
18       Burns.  May seem like a long time ago, but that first
19       videotape that you saw in the case was the videotape of
20       Dr. David Burns from the University of San Diego in
21       California.
22             Dr. Burns, as you may recall, is the leading
23       authority on smoking disease in this country.  He was
24       the author, the editor, contributor to over 19 of the
25       Surgeon General's reports relating to smoking and

 1       disease and the issues relating to it, such as
 2       addiction.
 3             He explained the addiction process as a physical
 4       process in which the brain creates receptors for
 5       nicotine.  And those receptors, if there is no longer
 6       nicotine coming in, result in withdrawal symptoms, much
 7       like any other withdrawal.  And you may recall his
 8       discussion of the withdrawal symptoms and the similarity
 9       between nicotine dependence, nicotine addiction and
10       other kinds of drug addiction.
11             Consequently, as he pointed out, most people who
12       try to quit smoking do not succeed.  They offered you a
13       chart in which he said in any given year about 40
14       percent of smokers indicate that they would like to quit
15       and are trying to quit, but less than 4 percent actually
16       succeed in the long run.
17             The process they go through is they attempt to
18       quit, they may succeed for a few hours, they may succeed
19       for a day, they may succeed for a few days, but they
20       relapse because the receptors in their brain require
21       another fix.  That is the process of addiction.  That is
22       the process that Eveline Warrick went through.
23             Now, there is no doubt under the evidence in this
24       case that Eveline Warrick was addicted to cigarettes.
25       You have two expert witnesses who were testifying

 1       specifically about her addiction.  One was Dr. Sandra
 2       Frazier from the University of Alabama, Birmingham,
 3       Medical School, where she is a professor and is a
 4       specialist in addiction medicine.  The other one was
 5       Dr. Jill Hayes, a psychologist, who also testified about
 6       addiction. 7             Despite the fact that one was our expert and one
 8       was their expert, both testified that Eveline Warrick
 9       was addicted to cigarettes.  The only disagreement about
10       whether she was addicted was when the addiction first
11       started, whether it was later or earlier.  They both
12       referenced the medical procedure for determining whether
13       there's addiction and they both agreed that there are
14       certain criteria for substance dependence that applies
15       to nicotine addiction out of a manual that is used by
16       doctors and psychiatrists and psychologists called
17       DSM-IV.  It is a compilation from specialists in the
18       field as to what the criteria are for various diagnostic
19       procedures.
20             One of the DSM-IV areas is the criteria for
21       substance dependence.  And she walked you through, as
22       did Dr. Hayes, the various requirements, from tolerance,
23       to withdrawal, to taking the substance in greater
24       amounts, to the persistent desire and unsuccessful
25       efforts to cut down, the amount of time spent in

 1       activities related to the use of the substance, to
 2       whether it had some impact on important social,
 3       occupational or recreational activities and the fact
 4       that one continued to use it despite knowledge of its
 5       persistent and recurrent physical impact.
 6             Those are the criteria set out by the DSM-IV.
 7       Dr. Hayes, Dr. Frazier talked about both and her meeting
 8       the necessary requirements.  I'm not going to walk you
 9       through each of those because there was no dispute
10       between the two of them that she would meet the
11       requirements for being addicted under DSM-IV.
12             What I think is important is to remember all that
13       she did to try and quit and her lack of success in
14       trying to quit.  I'm sure you'll all remember the
15       discussion.  And I thought, candidly, that perhaps one
16       of the best summaries of it came from Dr. Hayes on cross
17       examination when she was asked the question and she gave
18       the litany that was clear from the rest of the
19       testimony.
20             Mrs. Warrick used nicotine patches.  She used
21       nicotine gum.  She went to Dr. Bagnoli and got various
22       prescriptions to try and be able to quit cigarettes.
23       She used this tourniquet, a rubberband that someone at
24       the hospital suggested was a way of helping and popped
25       herself when she wanted to quit a -- a cigarette to try

 1       and keep her from doing it.  She tried hypnosis without
 2       any success.  She used prayer and discussions with
 3       others to try and quit.  She had discussions with her
 4       sisters.  She put lemon juice on her cigarettes to make
 5       them taste bad.  She packed up all of her smoking
 6       material, hid it away, put it away, threw away her
 7       cigarettes.  She did all of those things to try and quit
 8       smoking.  And when Dr. Hayes was asked if she had ever
 9       known anybody to do all of that, she agreed that she had
10       not, as did Dr. Frazier.
11             And the result of all of those attempts over a
12       nine-year period of time, from the early 1990s up to
13       late 2000, early 2001, when she was currently able to
14       quit, was they did not work until the final end.  She
15       would quit for a few hours, she would quit for a day,
16       she would quit for a few days, she even quit for three
17       weeks at one point in time, but she always came back 18       because, ladies and gentlemen, that's how addiction
19       works.  The brain demands a fix and you come back.
20       That's why it is so difficult to quit smoking.
21             And she described her withdrawal symptoms from
22       trying to quit smoking, sitting on the commode, crying,
23       feeling like every fiber in her body is on fire and
24       coming apart.  Shaking, sweating, unable to concentrate,
25       walking the floor, nervous, irritable, unable to sleep,

 1       those are classic withdrawal symptoms of a drug
 2       addiction, including the addiction to nicotine.
 3             Now, Mr. Reilly, in opening and in various
 4       questions tried to manipulate the evidence a bit by
 5       suggesting that she didn't have any withdrawal
 6       symptoms --
 7             MR. REILLY:  Objection.
 8             THE COURT:  Side-bar.
 9             (Counsel approach side-bar with the reporter and
10       the following proceedings were held out of the presence
11       of the jury:)
12             MR. REILLY:  Your Honor, my only objection is to
13       counsel characterizing my activities as manipulating the
14       evidence, that's a completely inappropriate argument.
15             MR. SHIELDS:  It is not any -- this is closing
16       argument, I can talk about what the testimony was and
17       what they said it was.
18             MR. REILLY:  I have no problem with counsel saying
19       what the evidence was, but when you characterize my
20       behavior as manipulating the evidence, that's
21       inappropriate argument in Florida.
22             THE COURT:  I -- I think I agree.  We've got all
23       kinds of law, case law, on attacking the other attorney
24       as opposed to what they're doing.
25             MR. SHIELDS:  Okay.

 1             THE COURT:  So I think you can say it in a
 2       different way, but that seems to be close to a direct
 3       attack on the other side.
 4             MR. SHIELDS:  Okay.
 5             THE COURT:  Okay.  I mean, I don't have a problem
 6       with your subject, it's -- it's --
 7             MR. SHIELDS:  All right.
 8             THE COURT:  So I'll sustain the objection.
 9             MR. SHIELDS:  Thank you.
10             (The following proceedings were held in open court
11   in the presence of the jury:)
12             THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Shields, I was trying
13       to fix that technical problem.
14             MR. SHIELDS:  Okay.
15             THE COURT:  You may proceed whenever you're ready,
16       Mr. Shields.
17             MR. SHIELDS:  All right.  Thank you.  The
18       defendants have claimed since their opening statement
19       that Mrs. Warrick did not have any symptoms when she
20       quit in late 2000 or early 2001.  I think fairness
21       requires a complete picture of what the testimony was.
22       Her family described her as having symptoms when she
23       quit, including nervousness and irritability.  She, in
24       fact, at another point in her deposition described
25       having those symptoms as well, even when she quit on

 1       that last occasion.
 2             Let's face it, here she was at the end of her 3       life, ten years after she had quit smoking, she was
 4       proud of the fact that she has quit smoking, and she
 5       wanted to make it clear how hard it was, but she finally
 6       succeeded and she was proud of that, as she had every
 7       right to be.  The important point to remember is that it
 8       took almost nine years of quit attempts, with all the
 9       withdrawal symptoms over and over that she had during
10       that time period.
11             Now, that evidence from both of the experts is
12       really beyond dispute.  But Dr. Hayes, the expert for
13       the defendants, goes on to say, but she could have quit
14       earlier or that she could have quit at a different point
15       in time.
16             Ladies and gentlemen, the issue is not whether at
17       this point or this first issue class, membership,
18       whether she had any responsibility for not quitting
19       earlier.  That's another issue.  That's the comparative
20       fault issue and we'll get to that in a moment.  But the
21       issue at this point is whether she was addicted to
22       cigarettes and whether that addiction caused or
23       contributed to her having COPD.
24             Now, the addiction side is absolutely clear
25       because there really is no dispute between the two

 1       experts that she was addicted.  Dr. Frazier says she was
 2       addicted by the late '50s, '55 to '59.  Dr. Hayes wants
 3       the addiction to occur at some later point in time, but
 4       regardless of the timing of the issue, there is no
 5       dispute that she was addicted.  Did her addiction play
 6       some role?  Did it contribute?  Did it cause her to have
 7       her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?
 8             Now, the court's going to instruct you in what's
 9       called the jury instruction or jury charge at the end of
10       these arguments about what the term causation means
11       under Florida law.  And I believe that the court's going
12       to instruct you that there can be more than one cause,
13       that there can be concurrent causes, that there can be
14       other and additional events that contribute to causing
15       an event.  And all that is required under Florida law is
16       that it be a substantial contributing factor to the
17       ultimate event.  So the question you face, then, is
18       whether her addiction played a role, was it a
19       substantial contributing factor to her having chronic
20       obstructive pulmonary disease?
21             Ladies and gentlemen, that's a simple matter, I
22       think, of logic.  And that is that there is no doubt
23       that she continued to smoke as a result of her nicotine
24       addiction.  The evidence is overwhelming of that.  There
25       is no doubt that her continuing to smoke caused her to

 1       have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  That is,
 2       had she not smoked or had she quit much earlier, then
 3       she would not have had chronic obstructive pulmonary
 4       disease.
 5             It follows that, as a matter of simple and pure
 6       logic, that if addiction caused her to continue to smoke
 7       and if smoking and her continued smoking caused her to
 8       have COPD, then she suffered COPD as a result of her
 9       addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine and that is
10       the definition of class membership.
11             You will be shown a verdict form in which you'll
12       have to answer that question of whether or not she comes
13       within the class member.  That is the first question. 14       That's why I told you that was the fundamental issue in
15       the case.  Was Eveline Warrick addicted to cigarettes
16       containing nicotine and, if so, was her addiction a
17       legal cause of her chronic obstructive pulmonary
18       disease?  The answer to that question should be yes.  If
19       it's yes, this case continues.  If it's no, this case is
20       over.
21             There should be no question in your mind that she
22       was addicted and that her addiction was a substantial
23       contributing factor to having chronic obstructive
24       pulmonary disease.  The answer to that first question on
25       the verdict form should be yes.

 1             And if the answer is yes, then we move to:  What
 2       is the impact on her in terms of the Engle findings?  If
 3       the answer to that question is yes, she becomes a member
 4       of the Engle class and as a member of the Engle class,
 5       she's entitled to the benefit of the findings of the
 6       prior jury trial in this class action.
 7             Those findings, as you may recall from opening
 8       statement, are as follows:  First, the jury, after a
 9       lengthy trial, hearing a massive amount of evidence
10       concluded that smoking cigarettes caused chronic
11       obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.  That was
12       called finding, general causation.
13             The jury also concluded that nicotine in
14       cigarettes is addictive, was finding two of that prior
15       trial.
16             Finding three was that all of the defendants, and
17       that would include both Philip Morris and R. J.
18       Reynolds, placed cigarettes on the market that were
19       defective and unreasonably dangerous.  That's called the
20       strict liability finding under the Engle findings.
21             Finding four was that all of the defendants, that
22       would include R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris,
23       concealed or omitted information not otherwise known or
24       available, knowing that that material was false,
25       misleading or failed to disclose a material fact

 1       covering the health effects or the addictive nature of
 2       smoking cigarettes or both.  That finding was called
 3       fraud by concealment.
 4             The next finding was that all of the defendants
 5       agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the
 6       health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature
 7       with the intention that smokers and the public, such as
 8       Eveline Warrick, would rely on that information to their
 9       detriment.  That finding was called civil conspiracy for
10       concealment.
11             Then the sixth finding of the Engle jury for which
12       you would be bound, if she's a member of the class, is
13       that the defendants, including R. J. Reynolds and Philip
14       Morris, sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective.
15       That's called the product defect finding.
16             The seventh finding was that the defendants sold
17       or supplied cigarettes that at the time of the sale or
18       supply did not conform to the representations of fact
19       made by the defendants.  That's called the breach of
20       warranty finding made by the Engle jury.
21             And the final finding of the Engle jury after that
22       trial was that all of the defendants, including R. J.
23       Reynolds, including Philip Morris, were negligent.  The
24       negligence finding. 25             The court will instruct you that if you answer

 1       that first question yes, that she was a member of the
 2       Engle class, then you are bound to apply those findings
 3       here.  They are conclusive as a matter of law and the
 4       court will instruct you of that.
 5             In addition to the Engle findings, these
 6       defendants have admitted from the beginning of this
 7       trial that smoking caused Eveline Warrick's COPD and
 8       that smoking caused Eveline Warrick to have lung cancer.
 9       I submit to you that applying the Engle findings to her
10       class membership and their admission that smoking caused
11       her COPD and that smoking caused her lung cancer
12       establishes their fault in this case, establishes their
13       liability and leads us to the next issue.
14             The next issue is comparative fault.  Recall that
15       from opening statement.  You recall that from one of the
16       major issues here.  Comparative fault is a matter that
17       the court will instruct you on.  Comparative fault gives
18       you the power as a jury to allocate their fault against
19       any fault Mrs. Warrick had for not quitting smoking
20       earlier.
21             Now, I made this clear at the beginning of the
22       case, I will repeat it again.  We've said it throughout.
23       On behalf of the estate of Eveline Warrick, we accept
24       that she bore some responsibility for not quitting
25       smoking earlier.  We accept that she has some fault.

 1       But we are here because these defendants refuse to
 2       accept any responsibility, refuse to accept any fault in
 3       connection with her smoking-related diseases.
 4             You are going to need to determine their fault,
 5       compare it to her fault and allocate between the two.
 6       And one of the issues that you will see on the verdict
 7       form is that specific question of how you allocate fault
 8       between the plaintiff, the estate of Eveline Warrick and
 9       between these two defendants.
10             In doing that, let's do what I did in opening
11       statement.  Let's compare what they knew, when they knew
12       it and what they did with what she knew and what she
13       did.  Isn't that the fair way to look at this?  Look at
14       both sides and say, what did they know and do, what did
15       she know and do?  And we could use the timeline that you
16       saw Mr. Reilly on behalf of Philip Morris use in his
17       opening statement and throughout the trial as a timeline
18       to look at those two questions.  Of course, notice that
19       the timeline he used did not address what they knew and
20       what they did.  It only addressed what she did.  To be
21       fair, we need to address both.
22             So let's start with an overview of the timeline.
23       Eveline Warrick was born in 1936.  At age 13, in 1949,
24       she first started smoking without any objection from her
25       parents.  When her mother died when she was 16, she

 1       moved in with her sister in Cocoa Beach, she's
 2       continuing to smoke at that point in time, had to drop
 3       out of school to work, although she later got her GED.
 4       She married Calvin Warrick at age 20 in 1956 and they
 5       both smoked.  She was diagnosed with chronic obstructive
 6       pulmonary disease by Dr. Bagnoli in 1991 and tried
 7       throughout the '90s, with his help, to quit smoking
 8       before she was finally able to succeed in late 2000 or
 9       early 2001. 10             She was diagnosed with lung cancer in March of
11       2009, went through extensive treatment for her lung
12       cancer throughout the rest of 2009 and died in February
13       this year.  That's the basic timeline.  And the question
14       is, to begin with, let's look at what they knew and what
15       they did in that basic timeline and compare it to what
16       she knew.
17             Now, the only thing we heard about what they knew
18       and did from Mr. Reilly and Mr. Engram in their opening
19       statements was the statement that there were a few
20       proposals, suggestions and statements and some bad
21       ideas.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to look
22       specifically at the documents and the evidence we have
23       shown you, it's not just a few suggestions or a bad idea
24       or some usings by some lower level employee of Philip
25       Morris or R. J. Reynolds, it was the policy, practice

 1       and pattern as part of the conspiracy over a decade's
 2       long period to do the very things that these documents
 3       show.
 4             And so let's look at what those documents show.
 5       Let's start, first, before 1949, before Eveline Warrick
 6       started to smoke.  Now, one of the things we did was
 7       offer you the testimony of one of the country's leading
 8       authorities on the history of tobacco advertising and
 9       marketing and the impact of tobacco advertising and
10       marketing.  Someone who was asked by the National Cancer
11       Institute, asked by the FDA about authoring material
12       relating to that and who has published a number of
13       peer-reviewed articles dealing with that subject.
14             And so Dr. Marvin Goldberg was our last witness
15       and the witness that discussed that issue in detail.
16       And what he told you was that back before 1949, back
17       before Eveline Warrick first started to smoke, that as a
18       result of the defendants' marketing and advertising and
19       public relations, they had created a culture of
20       acceptance of smoking.
21             We've talked a lot about it being a different time
22       and a different place.  And in 2010, it's sometimes hard
23       to think about how different this country was back in
24       1949, back in 1950, back in the '40s even, but it was a
25       different time.

 1             As a result of their massive advertising, they
 2       created the impression that everybody smoked, that it
 3       was acceptable to smoke.  Dr. Talked -- Dr. Proctor, one
 4       of the historians that testified, told you and showed
 5       you a chart of the consumption of cigarettes at that
 6       point in time and then percentage of people that smoked.
 7             Part of creating the impression back then that
 8       everybody smoked and that it's perfectly acceptable to
 9       smoke was using advertising to have celebrities and
10       athletes endorse smoking.  You recall that Dr. Goldberg
11       showed you some examples, here's one of them, where
12       Ginger Rogers, a celebrity during that time period, is
13       specifically endorsing a brand of cigarettes and dealing
14       with the issue does it cause any throat irritation.
15       Ginger Rogers wasn't the only person.  Literally every
16       celebrity back during that time period was paid to
17       endorse cigarettes and their ads were based around those
18       celebrities endorsing smoking cigarettes.
19             Not just celebrities, but athletes.  The
20       best-known athletes of the time period were seen with 21       cigarettes in their hands and endorsing smoking and
22       endorsing the activities relating to smoking as if they
23       had nothing to do with your ability to perform and your
24       lung function or throat irritation.  So you have this
25       culture in which celebrities and athletes and opinion

 1       leaders are all portraying smoking not just as
 2       acceptable, but as a desirable activity.
 3             And Dr. Goldberg said, they not only did those
 4       ads, but they used ads that were specifically aimed at
 5       children, at people in the early teens to mid teens
 6       because the cigarette companies over the last 70, 80
 7       years have known that most smokers start smoking in
 8       their teenage years, 14 to 17 years of age.  And that if
 9       they're going to get new smokers, if they're going to
10       get replacement smokers for those smokers that quit and
11       die, there's where they get them, they get them from
12       children.
13             And we're going to talk in the punitive damage
14       phase about the extensive evidence about their marketing
15       to children throughout that time period.  But part of
16       the ads was to portray smoking as glamorous, as adult,
17       as rebellious, as the cool thing to do.  And that's what
18       appeals to teenagers, that's what appeals to a
19       12-year-old or a 13-year-old or a 14-year-old.  It
20       worked.
21             Eveline Warrick testified she started smoking
22       because everybody smoked.  She started smoking because
23       it was glamorous.  She started smoking because it was
24       the cool thing to do, exactly what their marketing and
25       advertising was felt as -- of having her conclude.  And

 1       everyone around her smoked.  Her father, her
 2       grandfather, her sisters, her neighbors, her friends,
 3       her teachers, her coaches, her doctors.  Even when she
 4       was pregnant, her doctor smoked and never told her not
 5       to smoke when she was pregnant.
 6             So the culture of acceptability of smoking created
 7       by their massive marketing and advertising campaign
 8       clearly played an important role in her starting to
 9       smoke to begin with.
10             Now, what was also happening at that time period?
11       They knew that there were scientific literature going
12       back several decades connecting their product with
13       serious disease, including cancer.  They knew that there
14       were animal studies showing that it caused cancer going
15       back 20, 30, 40 years before 1949.
16             But the evidence got even more compelling starting
17       in 1950.  In 1950, a series of epidemiological studies
18       came out.  There was a study in the Journal of the
19       American Medical Association that tobacco smoking was a
20       cause of lung cancer.  It was followed by studies from
21       the British Medical Journal that smoking caused lung
22       cancer, by two of the most famous epidemiologists of our
23       time, Sir Richard Doll and Sir Bradford Hill, perhaps
24       the two most famous epidemiologists.
25             It was followed in 1953 by a conclusive animal

 1       study in which an experimental study, that is, you took
 2       the condensate from cigarette smoke and applied it to
 3       animals and compared it to those that didn't have it and
 4       show that you could create tumors on the skin of the
 5       animals from the cigarette condensate that was used. 6             That combination of materials, the epidemiological
 7       studies, the study from the animals created some public
 8       information and the stock price of the tobacco stocks
 9       dropped on Wall Street.  The industry panicked.  It was
10       the result of that panic that they got together at the
11       Plaza Hotel in December of 1953 and decided on what they
12       were going to do.
13             Now, you've seen a lot of documents throughout
14       referencing the American Tobacco Company and these
15       documents are going to be in evidence for you to take a
16       look at.  The American Tobacco Company is a company
17       that's now part of R. J. Reynolds and they're
18       responsible for whatever actions the American Tobacco
19       Company took back then, just as if they were fully a
20       part of Reynolds back then as well.  So you have the
21       American Tobacco Company, now, Reynolds, and you have
22       the Philip Morris Company attending that secret meeting.
23             Let me stop for just a moment and tell you
24       something that may be a little confusing to you and
25       you'll -- you'll see this when you get this massive

 1       number of documents for your deliberation, but down in
 2       the corner of the documents is a reference to a P
 3       number, right here it's P167, we referred throughout the
 4       case as -- that as Plaintiff's Exhibit 167 and so you'll
 5       see that's what the P167 refers to, but for purposes of
 6       keeping the documents in the order used by the court,
 7       Mr. Langley has put on consecutive numbers, so you will
 8       see different numbers in addition to the P number.  And
 9       so don't be confused by the fact that we had referred to
10       it by one exhibit number and there may be a court number
11       that's different on it.  You can see both on -- of them
12       by looking at the documents.
13             All right.  Back to the document.  At this meeting
14       at the Plaza Hotel, it was decided among the presidents
15       of the companies that the way to approach the problem
16       was by a public relations campaign.  And they hired the
17       company -- the country's leading PR firm, Hill &
18       Knowlton, to run that campaign for them.  You will have
19       in evidence Exhibit 167, which is a memorandum from Hill
20       & Knowlton relating to that meeting in which they had
21       discussions with the tobacco executives about what to
22       do.
23             And most significant, you will see their reference
24       to one of them attending the meeting, saying, it's
25       fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they can't

 1       break.  Another says, boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if
 2       our company was the first to produce a cancer-free
 3       cigarette?  Wait a minute.  You will see in a moment
 4       that they denied it had anything to do with cancer or
 5       that it caused cancer.  How can it be wonderful to
 6       produce a cancer-free cigarette if it doesn't cause it
 7       to begin with?  So even back at that meeting they were
 8       acknowledging that cigarettes are related to causing
 9       cancer.
10             And they also indicate something about their
11       motives.  Suppose everybody smoked just one cigarette
12       less a day.  That would be maybe 40 billion a year.  It
13       is hard to keep from concluding, as you review these
14       documents, that one of the principal motivations of this
15       decade-long campaign is profit.
16             Following the meeting, they issued a document 17       you've heard a lot about.  I think every witness at some
18       point in time has talked about it, you recall the
19       document, what's called The Frank Statement to Cigarette
20       Smokers, a document that was sent out as a full-page ad
21       to every newspaper in the country with a city of more
22       than 50,000 people and later reprints were created and
23       distributed throughout the country.
24             In that document they, for all practical purposes,
25       simply denied that there was proof that cigarette

 1       smoking was a cause of lung cancer.  And we will see in
 2       a moment that despite that denial, they knew to the
 3       contrary.  And they pledged to the American people that
 4       they would undertake their research to find out the
 5       truth and that their paramount concern was the health
 6       of their customers, but they already knew to the
 7       contrary.
 8             R. J. Reynolds' Chief Scientist, Claude Teague,
 9       was on his way helping the -- the company at the time
10       and did a survey of the cancer research for them with an
11       emphasis on the possible carcinogens in tobacco.  Now, I
12       know you-all know at this point in time what the term
13       carcinogen means.  It causes cancer.  And so saying that
14       there are carcinogens is an extremely significant
15       admission.
16             What this document does is it goes through all of
17       the nonchemical carcinogens in cigarette smoke and even
18       gives you the sort of atomic structure of those chemical
19       carcinogens.  And you'll have the document and you can
20       look at what goes on in the pages after this that shows
21       the chemical carcinogens.
22             And it talks about the statistical information,
23       those epidemiological studies we talked about and the
24       animal studies and it gives you a chart of how far back
25       those studies have gone, 1900, 1911, through 1930s into

 1       the 1940s, long before Eveline Warrick ever started
 2       smoking.  And it gives you the results of those study
 3       after study known to them in -- by that point in time.
 4       And, finally, gives you the conclusion about what all
 5       this means.
 6             Dr. Teague concluded that studies of clinical data
 7       tend to confirm the relationship between heavy and
 8       prolonged tobacco smoking and the incidence of cancer in
 9       the lungs.  In other words, the scientific evidence
10       supports the conclusion that cigarettes cause lung
11       cancer.  But it wasn't just R. J. Reynolds and Claude
12       Teague reaching that conclusion, you can look at later
13       documents that show the evidence as well.
14             In 1962, there is a report -- I'm -- I'm sorry,
15       the -- yeah, we'll go forward with it.  In 1958, there
16       is a survey done by a company then at the time, a
17       British company, but now a part of R. J. Reynolds for
18       which they are liable as well, that went through all of
19       the American Tobacco Companies and took a tour of their
20       scientific facilities, including the American Tobacco
21       Company, the predecessor to R. J. Reynolds and including
22       the Philip Morris Tobacco Company in Richmond, Virginia,
23       and met with their lead scientists to see what they
24       really thought about whether cigarettes caused lung
25       cancer.  This is 1958.

 1             And what they concluded was that with one 2       exception, Greene, who was not part of R. J. Reynolds,
 3       the American Tobacco Company or Philip Morris, so we
 4       know that the Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds people
 5       agreed with this, the individuals whom we met with
 6       believed that smoking caused lung cancer.  That's 1958.
 7       Their scientists believed that smoking caused lung
 8       cancer.
 9             You have an additional survey of the data from a
10       couple of documents that are relevant to both of these
11       defendants that absolutely confirms what they truly knew
12       and understood at the time.
13             One is from Dr. Rodgman in 1962 at the Reynolds
14       Tobacco Company and what Dr. Rodgman did was do an
15       evaluation of the health effects and a critical
16       appraisal of whether cigarettes caused lung cancer.  And
17       what he concluded, in his summary of the evidence today,
18       obviously, the amount of evidence accumulated to indict
19       cigarette smoke as a health hazard is overwhelming.  The
20       evidence challenging the indictment is scant.
21             There's also a Philip Morris document from that
22       basic same time period and in that document of November
23       1961, there's a presentation by Dr. Wakeman to the
24       Research and Development Committee at the headquarters
25       office of Philip Morris in New York City.  And in that

 1       document he lists a partial list of the compound in
 2       smoke that are carcinogens, the compounds in smoke that
 3       cause cancer.  In addition to that partial list, he also
 4       gave a list of the cancer-promoting agents that were
 5       also in smoke.  So that you have not only all these
 6       chemicals that cause cancer, but these chemicals that
 7       promote other chemicals that cause cancer.
 8             You know, it's really interesting, you saw that
 9       document from Dr. Rodgman that used the term
10       overwhelming, think about that.  Mr. Jupe testified as
11       one of their witnesses and said in 1999 they put up a
12       website statement that said the evidence was
13       overwhelming that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer
14       and other cancers and it was addictive.  They were using
15       that term overwhelming 35 years earlier, but despite the
16       fact that they were using it and understood it, what did
17       they do during that time period?  What did they tell
18       people like Eveline Warrick?  What did they tell the
19       American public?  What they told them was in speech
20       after speech, in article after article, in PR campaign
21       after PR campaign that there was not any evidence that
22       cigarette smoking was harmful or that it caused cancer.
23             Here's an example.  This is around the time of
24       that first meeting at the Plaza Hotel in which the
25       organizer of the meeting at the American Tobacco

 1       Company, Mr. Hahn, specifically denies that cigarette
 2       smoking is injurious to health and tries to reassure the
 3       public that there's no harm from smoking cigarettes.
 4       That statement continued in the decades after that
 5       meeting.
 6             Give you a couple examples.  The first example is
 7       a speech given by one of the top executives of Philip
 8       Morris in 1958, in which he specifically asserted,
 9       without rehashing the arguments, I merely assert that
10       there is not one shred of evidence to support the link
11       between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.  That was at
12       the same time period that their scientists were being 13       surveyed and admitted that cigarettes caused lung
14       cancer.
15             Or another example of that is a speech by the
16       president of Philip Morris in 1966, in which the
17       president of Philip Morris indicated what turned out to
18       be one of their major things throughout all of this time
19       period.  That is, if there's something in tobacco or in
20       the smoke that causes cancer or any other human disease,
21       we want to know what it is.
22             Wait a minute.  Their scientists identified all of
23       the carcinogens years earlier.  Their scientists pointed
24       out that those carcinogens were likely to cause lung
25       cancer years earlier.  And then he repeats what we have

 1       heard over and over again and that was repeated right up
 2       till 1999.  If there's something harmful, I'm confident
 3       the scientists can remedy it and take it out.
 4             Now, you heard Mr. Jupe tell you that the
 5       carcinogens in cigarette smoke could not be taken out
 6       because they are what is smoke to begin with.  Well, the
 7       point is not that they couldn't take them out, the point
 8       is to reassure people to get them to continue smoking.
 9       They said, if there's ever anything harmful in
10       cigarettes, we'll find it and take it out and you'll be
11       safe, knowing that was full of carcinogens and knowing
12       that there was no possible way to take it out.  The
13       issue is not whether they could take it out, the issue
14       is the fraud in asserting that if we find it, we will
15       take it out, knowing it's already there and knowing that
16       you can't take it out.
17             In addition to these statements, they created a
18       group called the Tobacco Industry Research Council,
19       later called the Council for Research on Tobacco.  And
20       it was a mere front organization.  It was a shingle.  We
21       have shown you the documents.  Dr. Proctor identified
22       them, for example, in which they acknowledge that TIRC
23       and CTR were merely an industry shield, were a front
24       organization, as part of their public relations
25       campaign.  And all that they told the American public,

 1       we have this independent research group that we're
 2       providing all this money to and they're doing this
 3       important scientific work to establish whether or not
 4       cigarettes cause cancer.  As Dr. Proctor told you, they
 5       didn't do any of the research.  As Dr. Farone told you,
 6       there was the gentleman's agreement that they wouldn't
 7       really do the research that could establish from their
 8       own research that cigarettes caused cancer, that
 9       instead, this research group was used as a shield and a
10       front organization to send out bogus appearing
11       scientific evidence denying that cigarettes caused lung
12       cancer.
13             They published, for example, this appearing to be
14       a scientific journal called Tobacco and Health Research.
15       And they send it out to every doctor in the country and
16       the opinion leaders and the editorial writers had filled
17       it full of articles that sounded like there wasn't any
18       basis for saying cigarettes caused lung cancer.  Here's
19       an example.  Lung specialist cites 28 reasons for
20       doubting cigarette to cancer link.
21             We can look back at those articles today and
22       you'll have them and they seem a bit absurd.  The claim,
23       for example, it must have something to do with genetics 24       because bald men don't get lung cancer.  Were it only
25       the case.  It looks a little silly looking back for

 1       these years, but it was a different time.  And at the
 2       time all of this data, all of this information, this
 3       bogus appearing information from their front
 4       organization had an impact.
 5             Eveline Warrick in those years was working at her
 6       sister's boardinghouse.  She later married Calvin
 7       Warrick.  And most important of all, she was already
 8       addicted to smoking cigarettes.
 9             Now, you've heard about her sister being diagnosed
10       with having some lung problem in the late '50s.  You
11       know there is very little real evidence relating to this
12       and a lot of expansion of what that evidence really
13       shows.  Mrs. Warrick testified that her sister had some
14       lung problems in the late '50s that the doctor related
15       to her working in the shipyards doing welding and her
16       smoking.
17             She later said, and this is the important part,
18       that when she connected it to smoking in the 1980s, she
19       got together with her sister and they talked about
20       trying to quit.  And she urged her sister to quit and
21       she talked about helping her sister quit.
22             So there's a little bit of limited testimony and a
23       great deal of expansion in this trial about what that
24       testimony really was and what it really meant.  It comes
25       down to the simple fact that her sister had some lung

 1       problems in the late '50s, which her doctor related to
 2       her welding and working in shipyards and to her smoking
 3       as well.  That is a long way, a long cry from saying
 4       that Mrs. Warrick thought at the time that there was any
 5       risk for her or people like her to get lung cancer or
 6       chronic obstructive lung disease as a result of her
 7       smoking.
 8             Dr. Goldberg also testified and showed you the
 9       chart that she was being inundated with advertising and
10       marketing at the time.  The tobacco companies were the
11       biggest advertisers and marketers in the country, ranked
12       right up there with Proctor & Gamble in advertising for
13       such products as Tide and other recognized household
14       names.  So all of that has an impact as well and
15       Dr. Goldberg took you -- told you about that impact.
16             So that's what's going on with her life while they
17       are sending out these bogus articles denying that
18       there's any causation, giving speeches, claiming that if
19       they ever find anything wrong, they'll take it out.
20       Well, if there was any doubt, all doubt about whether
21       cigarettes cause lung cancer was resolved by the 1964
22       report to the Surgeon General of the United States.  And
23       you'll have that document.  It's Exhibit 251.  That was
24       a blue ribbon panel of experts over which the defendants
25       had a veto of who could even serve on the panel that

 1       reviewed all the evidence and concluded that cigarette
 2       smoking caused lung cancer.  And it did receive a good
 3       bit of publicity at the time.
 4             You saw some of it in opening statement.  You saw
 5       the Harry Reasoner report at that point in time and you
 6       even saw it again at the end of the case.  What you
 7       didn't see was what they said on that very same program.
 8       When the defendants offered you the program and the 9       clip, they conveniently did not include the statement
10       from their own representative in the middle of it.  And
11       let's take a look a look at what that was.
12             (The video clip was played as follows:)
13             ANNOUNCER:  "This is a CBS news extra on smoking
14       and health, the findings of the Surgeon General's
15       Committee.
16             "In our studio this afternoon, following the
17       Surgeon General's news conference, CBS news
18       correspondent Richard C. Hottelet put some questions to
19       one of the leading spokesmen for the industry, Howard
20       Cullman, president of the Tobacco Merchants Association
21       and a longtime director of the Philip Morris Company.
22             MR. HOTTELET:  "Mr. Cullman, prominent in the
23       New York theater and civic affairs is a third-generation
24       member of a tobacco family.
25             "Mr. Cullman, the conclusions are pretty stark and

 1       pretty solid.  They say, quite flatly, the -- they
 2       express the judgment that cigarette smoking contributes
 3       substantially to mortality from certain specific
 4       diseases and to the overall death rate than they have
 5       the rate ten times as high for smokers in the case of
 6       lung cancer and rather higher in other cases.
 7             MR. CULLMAN:  "Well, it's awful hard to define the
 8       word substantial.  I don't believe that most people who
 9       smoke get lung cancer.  We are now in an era, as you
10       know, of moderation.  We eat more carefully.  We have
11       cholesterol habits.  We have drinking habits of lighter
12       whiskey.  We have smoking habits, which, incidentally,
13       are today changing the type of cigarettes from regular
14       cigarettes to filters.
15             "Now, I was surprised at the beginning of the
16       conference when Dr. Terry is supposed to have said that
17       there's very little evidence, if any, on the effect, if
18       any, of filtered cigarettes.
19             "So when we have today 60 percent of the business
20       in the filter field compared to 3 percent ten years ago,
21       I think we need a little more research.
22             "I'm convinced that eventually they will find some
23       element through a filter or through leaf growing or a
24       special type of seed growing that will eliminate the
25       mysterious thing they are looking for.

 1             "We want to be the detective just as much as the
 2       Surgeon General or the AMA, and we'll cooperate in every
 3       way.
 4             MR. HOTTELET:  "Well, are you saying, then, sir,
 5       that there is something toxic about tobacco which are
 6       removable by filter?
 7             MR. CULLMAN:  "Well, obviously, a filter takes out
 8       certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think the Industry
 9       admits there are any bad elements.  If there are bad
10       elements, through our laboratories, through the Surgeon
11       Generals, through the AMA, through acts of God and luck,
12       we hope we may find them.  And if they are found, they
13       will be removed, but at this point we do not know.
14             MR. HOTTELET:  "Now, does any of the research that
15       the tobacco industry has been engaged in refute any part
16       of the findings here or the conclusions as a whole?
17             MR. CULLMAN:  "Well, without reading the report, I
18       couldn't answer that to begin with.  I don't think the
19       tobacco industry, as a whole, agrees with the 20       conclusions."
21             (The video clip was ended.)
22             MR. SHIELDS:  Eveline Warrick testified that she
23       had a vague recollection of the Surgeon General's
24       report, but she thought it was in the 1980s, that maybe
25       that she was simply remembering one of the later

 1       reports.  There were 19 of them that followed that one.
 2             I think the important point, however, is that
 3       Eveline Warrick, like, more than half of the members of
 4       the expert panel who wrote the Surgeon General's report,
 5       like the then president of the United States and the
 6       First Lady, smoked.  We're going to see that this
 7       conspiracy denying what the Surgeon General had to say
 8       continued in the decades following.
 9             Your Honor, this might be an appropriate time to
10       take a break.  I'm, obviously, not going to finish
11       before the morning break.
[#DELETED RECESS#]
14            MR. SHIELDS:  Good morning, again.
15            THE JURY:  Good morning.
16            MR. SHIELDS:  We were talking about the 1964
17       Surgeon General's report.  And let's look quickly at
18       how they responded to that report.
19            This next document is a letter from the two top
20       executives at the Philip Morris Company.  That's
21       stamped confidential, and it's following when the
22       Surgeon General's report came out.
23            What it says, we must in the near future
24       provide some answers which will give smokers a
25       psychological crutch and a self rationale to

 1       continue smoking.
 2            The psychological crutch, the rationale to
 3       continue smoking, was their continued campaign of 4       denial in which they focused on two things; one was
 5       to say that there was a scientific controversy that
 6       there was doubt about the findings of the Surgeon
 7       General.
 8            And the second, the thing you just saw from the
 9       CBS News report saying if we ever find anything in
10       this product that is dangerous, we'll take it out,
11       so continue to smoke because if there's anything
12       wrong with it, we'll solve that problem before you
13       have any problem.
14            Let's look at the Surgeon General's report some
15       15 years later.  And it's analysis of what the
16       evidence was.
17            In 1979 there was a report by the Surgeon
18       General that summarized what had happened in those
19       intervening years.  It starts by pointing out that
20       on January is 11th, 1964, the Surgeon General's
21       Advisory Committee On Smoking and Health concluded
22       that cigarette smoking is a health hazard.  It then
23       turned to discussing the tobacco industry's
24       response.
25            This document is significant for another

 1       reason.  It wrote, it demolishes the claims made by
 2       cigarette manufacturers and a few others 15 years
 3       ago, and today, that the scientific evidence was
 4       sketchy, that no link between smoking and cancer was
 5       proven.  Those claims, empty then, are utterly
 6       vacuous now.  15 years of additional research
 7       overwhelmingly ratified the original scientific
 8       indictment of smoking as a contributor to the
 9       disease and premature death.
10            It's still 20 years later before Philip Morris
11       and R.J. Reynolds finally admitted that cigarettes
12       caused lung cancer and other diseases, before they
13       finally admitted that cigarettes were addictive.
14       Throughout that time period they played their
15       campaign of doubt and their assertion that if we
16       ever find anything wrong, we will take it out.
17            Let me give you a few examples.  If we could
18       dim the lights, I want to play some videos that span
19       that entire time period.
20            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Frank, if you'll do that.
21            THE BAILIFF:  Yes, sir.
22            (The video clip was played as follows:)
23            We are also very concerned about the charges
24       levelled against our product.  And we're very
25       anxious to do whatever we can to clear the air in

 1       this matter.  We happen to be optimistic about the
 2       future.  And we happen to feel this is a great
 3       industry, and that this industry can face the future
 4       with confidence because when and if any ingredient
 5       in cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious
 6       to human health, we are confident we can eliminate
 7       that ingredient.
 8            (The video clip was ended.)
 9            MR. SHIELDS:  That's the president of Philip
10       Morris, Mr. Cullman, in the late '60s.
11            Next video.
12            (The video clip was played as follows:)
13            We do talk to the question of whether or not
14       cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not believe that 15       cigarettes are hazardous.  We don't accept that.
16            From our standpoint if anyone ever identified
17       any ingredient in tobacco or smoke as being
18       hazardous to human health, or as being something
19       that shouldn't be there, we would eliminate it, but
20       no one ever has.
21            (The video clip ended.)
22            MR. SHIELDS:  That's the executive vice
23       president of Philip Morris in 1976.
24            (The video clip was played as follows:)
25            As manufacturer of the world's biggest selling

 1       cigarette, are you concerned that the World Health
 2       Organization said that cigarettes are the cause of a
 3       worldwide epidemic of a disease that at present
 4       kills hundreds of thousands of smokers every year?
 5            Am I concerned?  I'm concerned in but possibly
 6       a different way than you might think.  I'm concerned
 7       that people make claims, including those against our
 8       products, without adequate knowledge.  There has not
 9       been the sort of research really that would permit
10       anyone to say that.
11            (The video clip ended.)
12            MR. SHIELDS:  That's the next -- move forward.
13            (The video clip was played as follows:)
14            Is it possible that your refusal to accept the
15       evidence may be countered by the fact that you make
16       cigarettes?
17            Is that possible?  Oh, of course, that's
18       possible, Peter.  I think I'm a fairly reasonable
19       human being and not -- or wouldn't be in the
20       business if I thought cigarettes were harmful to
21       people.  I think it's important that there be a lot
22       of us around who are trying to keep the research
23       honest and open.  I think the real dishonesty is
24       telling people things that are not so.
25            Are you saying that cigarettes are harmless?

 1            I don't know that.  I don't know that they're
 2       harmful or harmless.  What I'm saying is that
 3       someone should find out.
 4            (Video clip ended.)
 5            MR. SHIELDS:  All right.  Let's move forward
 6       from the '70s into the '80s in which their
 7       representative at the Tobacco Institute continued
 8       that same assertion, that they don't know they're
 9       harmful and if there's anything wrong, then we'll
10       take it out.
11            (Video clip played as follows:)
12            WPLG GE Miami.  Good morning.  Warning, the
13       Surgeon General has determined cigarette smoking is
14       dangerous to your health.  We know that appears on
15       all cigarette packages, yet, people continue to
16       talk.
17            Here to talk about a thriving tobacco industry
18       is tobacco representative, Ann Browder, and the
19       person who would like to see them go out of business
20       Charles Tate of the American Lung Association.
21            Good morning.
22            Good morning.
23            And welcome to A.M..
24            Ms. Browder, first of all, we know cigarette
25       smoking is bad for our health.  P. 4980
 1            Why does the Tobacco Institute continue to
 2       promote smoking?
 3            Well, the Tobacco Institute does not promote
 4       smoking.  It promotes the right of an individual to
 5       make a decision to smoke, and then supports that
 6       individual in making that decision.
 7            And I have to disagree with you in that we
 8       don't know what causes the ailments that have been
 9       attributed to cigarette smoke.  Certainly I am not
10       denying the fact that cigarette smoking could be a
11       risk factor involved with some people and some of
12       the problems they might have, but I don't think
13       there is a causal relationship between cigarette
14       smoking and any disease.  If there were, Diane, I
15       don't think there would be a cause without the
16       effect or the effect without the cause, and we all
17       know that that happens.

19            (The following video clip was played:)
20            These pictures are from Superman II.  Marlboro,
21       made by Philip Morris, is shown at least 13 times.
22       I asked the Tobacco Institute why Marlboros were
23       shown so often in Superman II.
24            Do you think the cigarette manufacturers had
25       something to do with that?

 1            Yeah, I think that --
 2            Cigarette manufacturers don't make movies.
 3            What do you think the moviemaker just showed
 4       Marlboro on its own?
 5            Perhaps the moviemaker was a Marlboro smoker.
 6            (Video clip ended.)
 7            MR. SHIELDS:  You recall the testimony of Dr.
 8       Proctor who stated the history of science of smoking
 9       and of Dr. Goldberg who looked at all their
10       advertising who told you under oath, and there's no
11       evidence to the contrary, that they paid money to
12       place their product in movies as part of the
13       continuing advertising and marketing campaign.
14            (The following video clip was played:)
15            We asked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &
16       Williamson and Lorillard to appear on this program,
17       none would.  They told us to talk to the Tobacco
18       Institute.  The institute said Ann Browder would
19       speak for them.
20            Okay.  The jury has not come in.
21            It may not be harmful, you're not convinced?
22            It may be or it may not be, we don't know.
23            (Video clip ended.)
24            MR. SHIELDS:  You can get the lights now.
25            THE COURT:  Let's get the lights.

 1            MR. SHIELDS:  That campaign of claiming there
 2       was insufficient evidence, of claiming if there was
 3       something wrong, they will take it out continued
 4       right up to 1999.
 5            Let's talk about another aspect of that
 6       campaign.  The denial that cigarettes were
 7       addictive, first let's look at what they really
 8       knew, what information they had about the addictive
 9       nature of cigarettes.
10            The evidence in this case is that going back to 11       at least the mid '50s these companies were
12       researching the addictive properties of cigarettes
13       for purposes of understanding how to sell their
14       product.
15            We saw some of those documents in the testimony
16       of the witnesses.  I'm going to show you just a
17       couple of them.  One is a report from a Mr. Wakeham
18       presented to the Philip Morris Board of Directors in
19       1969 in which he discusses the question of what does
20       nicotine in cigarettes do, what does it have to do
21       with people smoking and continuing to smoke.
22            They asked two questions; first, why does one
23       begin to smoke?  And why does one continue to smoke?
24            Both are relevant to evaluating Evelyn Warrick.
25            His answer is that there is general agreement

 1       on the answer to the first part.  The 16 to 20-year
 2       old begins smoking for psychosocial reasons.  The
 3       act of smoking is symbolic; it signifies adulthood.
 4       He smokes to enhance his image in the eyes of his
 5       peers, but the psychosocial motive is not enough to
 6       explain continued smoking.
 7            He then analyzes the evidence and says we are
 8       of -- of the conviction in -- in view of the
 9       foregoing that the ultimate explanation for the
10       perpetuated cigarette habit resides in
11       pharmacological -- that is drug effect -- of smoke
12       upon the body of the smoker.
13            Now, that feeling, that analysis that it has
14       the impact of a drug is also seen in another
15       document from Philip Morris from Mr. Dunn who was
16       principally responsible for evaluating the effects
17       of nicotine.  And he wrote in this document, first,
18       that no one has ever become a cigarette smoker by
19       smoking cigarettes without nicotine.  A recognition
20       that the reason people smoke is because of the
21       nicotine in cigarette.
22            He secondly points out that you need to think
23       of the cigarette as a dispenser of a dose unit of
24       nicotine.
25            It's a drug dispenser.  And they knew it, they

 1       recognized it going back years.  In fact, one of
 2       their principal spokesman put it very succinctly in
 3       this next document that we will see, document marked
 4       Strictly Private, Confidential dated July 17th,
 5       1963, in which he says unequivocally nicotine is
 6       addictive.  We are then in the business of selling
 7       nicotine, an addictive drug, effective in the
 8       release of stress.  A candid recognition that
 9       nicotine is addictive.  And that we're selling
10       cigarettes is all about is selling a drug.  That's
11       what they knew.
12            But what they said was to the contrary.   They
13       continued to deny that nicotine was addictive.  And
14       in 1994 they appeared before Congress, the
15       presidents of each of these companies, and denied
16       under oath that nicotine was addictive.
17            (The video clip was played as follows:)
18            Let me begin my questioning on the matter of
19       whether or not nicotine is addictive.  Let me ask
20       you first, and I'd like to just go down the row
21       whether each of you believe that nicotine is not 22       addictive.  I heard virtually all of you touch on
23       it.  Yes or no, do you believe nicotine is not
24       addictive?
25            I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.

 1            Mr. Johnson?
 2            Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do
 3       not meet the classic definitions of addiction.
 4       There is no intoxication --
 5            We'll take that as a no.  And again time is
 6       short, if you could just -- I believe each of you
 7       believe nicotine is not addictive.  I would just
 8       like to have this for the record.
 9            I don't believe that nicotine or our products
10       are addictive.
11            I believe nicotine is not addictive.
12            I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
13            I believe that nicotine is not addictive.
14            And I, too, believe that nicotine is not
15       addictive.
16            (The video clip ended.)
17            MR. SHIELDS:  That's the summary of the
18       evidence showing their campaign of doubt and deceit.
19            What evidence did they offer to the contrary?
20       They offered Mr. Jupe, the only witness they offered
21       to testify about these issues, who didn't go to work
22       for Philip Morris until 1995, and who claimed not to
23       have even read most of the relevant documents that
24       we've just gone through.  The evidence is
25       overwhelming of their campaign of denial and deceit.

 1       That's on one side of the ledger of what they knew,
 2       when they knew it and what they did.
 3            Let's compare the other side.  Compare it to
 4       Mrs. Warrick.  Like most smokers, she continued to
 5       believe for most of her smoking history that
 6       cigarettes were not hazardous.  She testified on
 7       several occasions in the videotaped deposition of
 8       her that you saw she did not recognize the hazards
 9       of cigarettes until the mid to late '80s.  She was
10       not at all unlike other smokers, there's a great
11       deal of evidence about what smokers thought
12       throughout that time period.
13            The gallop polls in the 1950s, which Dr.
14       Proctor told you about at the beginning of this
15       case, indicated that while people were aware of the,
16       quote, controversy, that most people, and
17       particularly smokers, did not believe in the 1950s
18       and 1960s that cigarettes caused lung cancer.
19            Dr. Goldberg went further.  He said, let's not
20       just look at the gallop polling.  Let's look at the
21       internal surveys done for the cigarette industry.
22       And he showed you a couple of those surveys.  In
23       particular, he showed you a Roper called survey for
24       them in 1959 entitled A Study of the Attitudes
25       Towards Smoking and Different Types of Cigarettes,

 1       in which the majority of smokers surveyed did not
 2       believe that cigarettes were harmful or addictive.
 3            He showed you a subsequent poll and survey in
 4       1970, A Study of the Public Attitudes Towards
 5       Cigarette Smoking and the Tobacco Industry.  This
 6       was conducted by the Tobacco Institute by the Roper 7       Research Group for the tobacco group.  And it was
 8       dated July 1970, in which almost two-thirds of the
 9       smokers as of 1970 still did not believe cigarettes
10       caused lung cancer or the claims that were then made
11       against them.
12            And Mrs. Warrick certainly wasn't alone.  And
13       why is that true?  It is true, because as Dr.
14       Goldberg told you, there was a massive advertising
15       marketing campaign to convince people to the
16       contrary.  We will discuss that campaign and look at
17       some of those documents in just a minute.
18            But let's pull all of this together.  We have
19       their activities, we have her activities to compare.
20       How do you allocate the responsibility?  How do you
21       determine which caused her to have a smoking-related
22       disease.  Well, to continue with, the Court will
23       instruct you there can be more than one cause.
24       There can be several causes.  The question is, for
25       their conduct, did it contribute?  Was it a

 1       substantially contributing factor, just as you look
 2       at her conduct.  And if it did, and we think the
 3       evidence is overwhelming that it, then it's
 4       appropriate to allocate fault between the two.
 5            Now, why do I say that the evidence is
 6       overwhelming?  Let's pull it together.  First, their
 7       wrongful conduct as we have seen contributed to
 8       causing her to smoke in the first place, but
 9       creating this overall climate that cigarette smoking
10       was acceptable, appropriate activity, even for
11       adolescents.
12            Second, as they expected, once she started
13       smoking, she became addicted to the cigarettes and
14       had to continue smoking in order to maintain her
15       nicotine addiction.
16            Third, this campaign contributed to her smoking
17       because they drowned out any evidence to the
18       contrary.  They drowned out the public relations
19       message with their massive campaign.
20            Now, you saw this diagram that Dr. Goldberg
21       presented to you that compared what kinds of -- te
22       impacts that were being presented to -- let's go to
23       the -- to the Folcum chart, please.  That compared
24       all of the available information during the time
25       period that Evelyn Warrick smoked.  And on one side

 1       you had the tobacco industry's heavy, sophisticated
 2       advertising and promotion campaign.  We talked about
 3       how they were the largest advertisers in the country
 4       and how advertising works in impacting this case.
 5       Now, we all like to think to doesn't.  If we're
 6       asked did you do something because of advertising?
 7       Most of us would say oh, no, I didn't do it because
 8       of the advertising.
 9            Ask yourself this question, why would these
10       sophisticated marketing people spend the vast amount
11       of money they did on advertising and marketing if it
12       didn't work?
13            Now, they can say, well, we were just trying to
14       influence an existing smoker.  We were trying to
15       make a smoker switch from Camels to Marlboros.
16            Dr. Goldberg explained to you if you took the
17       amount of brand switching from one company to the 18       other and compared that to how much money they
19       spent, the amount that they spent just dwarfs any
20       revenue they would get from brand switching.  You
21       can't explain the massive advertising as an attempt
22       to get somebody to switch from Camels to Marlboros
23       or the other way around.
24            That massive advertising is done for two
25       reasons is; first, to get, quote, replacement

 1       smokers, age 14 to 17, to start smoking because it's
 2       the cool thing to do and get them addicted so they
 3       become lifetime smokers.
 4            And, secondly, that advertising is done to get
 5       people to continue to smoke, to reinforce their
 6       denial that cigarette smoking must be harmful to the
 7       public.
 8            And, consequently, you have this massive amount
 9       of advertising pressing down on one side.
10            Now, you do have some public health communities
11       occasionally -- and you were shown those the other
12       day.  At the end of the evidence you were shown a
13       series of public service announcements.  Now, did
14       you note they call came within a narrow band of time
15       within the late '60s?  Why was that?  It was
16       explained by Dr. Burns, it was because of what was
17       called the Fairness Doctrine.  The FCC in the late
18       '60s held if they were going to put their
19       advertising on television, then the television
20       stations had to put on some public service
21       announcement under the Fairness Doctrine.  But it
22       only lasted a very short period of time because the
23       advertising on television was then banned, and with
24       it's banning, the public service announcements
25       disappeared.

 1            Compare also that on part of this chart a got
 2       their public announcements -- disinformation
 3       campaign.  Their campaign of not only advertising,
 4       but of saying, oh, there's doubt.  There's a
 5       scientific controversy.  And if we ever find
 6       anything harmful in our product, we'll take it out,
 7       so continue to smoke.
 8            You also have warnings on the packs after 1969.
 9       Were they effective?  The Federal Trade Commission,
10       the federal -- the FDA looked at that specific issue
11       to determine the effectiveness of the warnings in
12       1967.  They reported to Congress, June 30th, 1967,
13       about whether those warning labels were having any
14       impact.  And their conclusion was that, quote, the
15       commission believes that the warning label on the
16       cigarette packages has not been succeeded in
17       overcoming the prevalent attitude towards cigarette
18       smoking created and maintained by the cigarette
19       companies through their advertisements, particularly
20       the barrage of commercials on television which
21       portray cigarette smoking as harmless and an
22       enjoyable social activity that is not habit forming
23       and involves in hazards to health.  The fact of the
24       matter was the labels were ineffective.
25            The Federal Trade Commission conducted surveys

 1       of smokers and others and found that people didn't
 2       even know they were on the product.  They didn't 3       read them.  It had virtually no impact at all on
 4       their perception of whether cigarette smoking was
 5       dangerous.
 6            And so in analyzing them both, in analyzing
 7       allocation, keep in mind that the message that there
 8       was something wrong with cigarette smoking was
 9       totally smothered and drowned out by the companys'
10       advertising and marketing.
11            There is a related causation issue which we
12       need to discuss briefly.  And, in fact, you probably
13       heard more evidence on that from the defendant than
14       anything else, and that's the question of whether
15       Mrs. Warrick died of lung cancer or COPD or she died
16       of heart disease.  Most of their evidence dealt with
17       that issue.
18            Ladies and Gentlemen, that is a totally false
19       issue.  It is a false issue because it makes little
20       or no difference how you answer that question.  The
21       estate, the Court will instruct you, is entitled to
22       recover whether or not she died of lung cancer or
23       COPD.  If she died of lung cancer or COPD, it's one
24       claim.  It's called a wrongful death claim.  And you
25       will be given a verdict form for a wrongful death

 1       claim if you determine that she died as a result of
 2       lung cancer or COPD.
 3            But if you determine she did not, this case
 4       isn't over, the plaintiff can still be entitled to
 5       recover.  It's then a different kind of claim.  It's
 6       called a survival claim, that is, a claim that
 7       survived her death and as if Mrs. Warrick were here
 8       seeking damages for her personal injuries and had
 9       not died of smoking.  That's what a survival claim
10       is.  And she would be entitled if she were here to
11       recover for her injuries even though she hadn't
12       died.  Does that make sense?  Yes.
13            You wouldn't think that just because you died,
14       then there would be no right to recover if your
15       death was caused by the product for the thing that
16       you had before you died, so in either event, whether
17       wrongful death, whether survival claim, the
18       plaintiff would be entitled to recover.
19            There are certain undisputed facts on that
20       issue.  And we suggest to you if you just consider
21       those facts, it's pretty easy resolve the issue.
22            First, Dr. Bagnoli started treating Evelyn
23       Warrick for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
24       disease in 1991 and treated her for the rest of her
25       life.

 1            Second, she got progressively worse from her
 2       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease right up to
 3       the end of her life requiring the use of oxygen and
 4       a wheelchair.
 5            Third, she was disabled, and despite the fact
 6       that she wanted to continue to work, was no longer
 7       able to work as a result of her chronic obstructive
 8       pulmonary disease.
 9            She was diagnosed with lung cancer in March of
10       2009.  It was stage IV lung cancer.  Now, what does
11       that mean?  Stage IV it means it was terminal.  It's
12       the highest stage you can have.  It meant that it
13       had already spread elsewhere in other body.  It had 14       spread from her lungs to her bones.  And by the time
15       she had died it had spread to her liver and it had
16       spread to her brain, what is called metastatic lung
17       cancer.
18            She underwent debilitating chemotherapy,
19       growing weaker and weaker, wasting, losing her hair,
20       and it was ineffective, so that after months of
21       chemotherapy, they had to switch the chemotherapy
22       agent to a see if a new chemotherapy agent would do
23       any good.  And they also added radiation because it
24       spread to her bones.
25            She was hospitalized just before her death for

 1       17 days.  In today's world to be hospitalized for 17
 2       days is a long time.  And it tells you how serious
 3       her condition was at that time.  She had pneumonia.
 4       Her blood was shot.  She had little or no red blood
 5       cells or white blood cells or platelets.  She
 6       required packed blood cells in order to survive.
 7       Her immune system was totally compromised and
 8       destroyed from the chemotherapy and from the
 9       radiation, among the other problems she had.  She
10       was frail, losing weight, wasting away with severe
11       breathing problems.  She was so immune compromised
12       that in order for Norma to go see her, and other
13       family members, they had to put on gowns and gloves
14       and masks to even go into her room.
15            Now, that's undisputed.  Those are the facts of
16       how she was leading up to her death.
17            Her treating doctors, Dr. Bagnoli, Dr. Nurani,
18       testified that in their view she died of lung cancer
19       and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  They
20       were the doctors on the scene to know her condition
21       and to know what was happen.
22            But an autopsy was performed as well.  That
23       autopsy didn't say anything about her dying as a
24       result of a cardiac arrythmia or ventricle
25       defibrillation as the defendants are contenting.

 1       The defendants say she died because some of that
 2       related it her heart.  And you note that I said some
 3       of that, because there is a little bit of
 4       inconsistency between the two experts the defendants
 5       offered.
 6            They offered Dr. Shuman, a pathologist from
 7       Miami.  You note that they did not call the
 8       pathologist from Jacksonville who actually performed
 9       the autopsy or a treating cardiologist from
10       Jacksonville to treated her in the past for any
11       problem, or any of the cardiologists that saw her in
12       January just before she died during her 17 days in
13       the hospital.  Instead they go down to Miami and
14       hire two experts.
15            The first of which Dr. Shuman who is an
16       associate medical examiner in Miami.  And she said
17       -- he said she died of hypertension.
18            We looked at her blood pressure readings, they
19       were all well within normal in the time period
20       before her death.  We looked at her blood pressure
21       readings for the prior four years, and the majority
22       of them were normal.  Yes, she had hypertension in
23       the past, but it was well controlled.  There is no
24       basis to suggest that her hypertension had something 25       to do with her death in February of 2010.

 1            They also offered the testimony of Dr.
 2       Bishopric.  She said that Mrs. Warrick died of an
 3       enlarged heart that caused ventricular
 4       defibrillation.  But most important, she indicated
 5       that she thought her hypertension was well
 6       controlled and couldn't say that it had anything to
 7       do with her death.  Exact opposite of what Dr.
 8       Shuman claimed.  Dr. Shuman claimed it was a cardiac
 9       arrythmia, Dr. Bishopric said no, it wasn't a
10       cardiac arrythmia, it was a ventricular
11       defibrillation.
12            Dr. Shuman, in fact, when given a hypothetical
13       and told what the testimony of Dr. Bishopric was
14       described it as ludicrous.
15            I don't know the answer.  I do know in order to
16       resolve the issue, we brought in the world's leading
17       pathologist, Dr. Emanuel Rubin.  Mr. Pathology.  The
18       man who has written more on the subject than anybody
19       else in the country, the author of the world's
20       leading textbook on pathology, and a man who has
21       been given every award you can possibly get as a
22       pathologist.
23            And what he told you was just plain common
24       sense.  He said there is no evidence on the autopsy
25       that she died from any cardiac arrythmia.  Dr.

 1       Shuman agreed with that as well.  He said there is
 2       no basis to blame it on an enlarged heart.  There is
 3       no basis under the autopsy to conclude anything
 4       other than the obvious, that she died from the
 5       spread of her lung cancer.  That's just plain common
 6       sense.
 7            Now, you will have verdict forms that allow you
 8       to determine whether you think she died from chronic
 9       obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer or
10       whether it was from some other cause.  And if you
11       answer one in one way saying it did not cause her
12       death, then there's the survival claim.  If you
13       answer in the other way, it's a wrongful death
14       claim.  And as Mr. Block is going to explain to you
15       in a few moments, in fact, we might be better off if
16       we just claimed it was a survival claim and didn't
17       even contest what they were saying about her
18       enlarged heart.  But we're here about the truth.
19            And the truth is simple and plain, and, that
20       is, but for her compromised immune system, but for
21       her totally deteriorating condition, but for the
22       spread of cancer and her inability to breathe
23       because of COPD she would be alive today.
24            Let's turn to the final issue.  Punitive
25       damages.  You are going to be asked whether or not

 1       to award punitive damages in this case.  And you
 2       will be given an instruction on what constitutes
 3       punitive damages and the basis for punitive damages
 4       under Florida law.
 5            That instruction will tell you that punitive
 6       damages are warranted if you find by clear and
 7       convincing evidence that the conduct causing loss,
 8       injury, damage or death to the plaintiff was so
 9       gross and flagrant as to show a reckless disregard 10       for human life for the safety of persons exposed to
11       the effects of such conduct; or
12            The conduct showed such an entire lack of care
13       that the defendants must have been consciously
14       indifferent to the consequences; or
15            That the conduct showed an entire lack of care
16       that the defendants must have wantonly and
17       recklessly disregarded for the safety and welfare of
18       the public; or
19            That the conduct showed such reckless
20       indifference to the rights of others as to be the
21       equivalent of intentional violation.
22            The evidence is just overwhelming that punitive
23       damages are appropriate.  You have the decades' long
24       conspiracy to deny, to see, to misrepresent, conceal
25       and manipulate the evidence so as to keep people

 1       smoking knowing that the long-term impact of smoking
 2       is the high likelihood that they'll get
 3       life-threatening diseases and die from the
 4       cigarettes they are smoking.  That is the essence of
 5       the entitlement of punitive damages.  If punitive
 6       damages are ever appropriate, they are appropriate
 7       in this case.
 8            Now, did they bring any officer or executive in
 9       to explain that they really didn't know all this,
10       that all of these documents don't really say what
11       they say?  Did they provide you any evidence to
12       suggest that they weren't lying to the American
13       public when they denied this right up to 1999?
14       Instead, you have Dr. Jupe on the stand -- Mr. Jupe,
15       I'm sorry, he's not a doctor, doesn't even have a
16       master's degree.
17            And what Mr. Jupe said was we admitted in 1999
18       that cigarettes caused cancer.  We admitted in 1999
19       that they were addictive.  And I said to Mr. Jupe,
20       all right.  You admitted it, when did you know?  He
21       didn't answer.  Oh, we admitted it in 1999.  Yes,
22       Mr., Jupe but when did you know?  Well, we admitted
23       it in 1999.  He simply would not give a straight
24       answer to a simple fundamental question, when did
25       you know?  Because the straight fundamental answer

 1       about when did you know was back in the '50s,
 2       clearly by 1964, no doubt throughout the following
 3       decades, they knew cigarettes caused cancer, they
 4       knew that cigarettes were addictive and they
 5       continued to deny it right up to 1999 when the Engle
 6       case was tried.  And the jury came back with the
 7       Engle findings that said, the contested case,
 8       cigarettes cause lung cancer, cigarettes are
 9       addictive.  And that's when the admission finally
10       came.
11            There is one final issue I need to talk to you
12       about and that's a defense that they've offered in
13       the case.  It's a defense of the statute of
14       limitations.  Since it is an affirmative defense
15       they have the burden of proving this defense.
16       Statute of limitations is a legal concept as to when
17       you have to bring a lawsuit after the claim arises.
18            They are asserting as an affirmative defense
19       that Mrs. Warrick didn't bring her claim in time,
20       and that, consequently, she's barred from bringing 21       this lawsuit.  The Florida Statute of limitations is
22       four years, this class action lawsuit was filed in
23       May of 1994, so their argument has to be that she
24       knew she had a claim and didn't file it prior to May
25       of 1990.

 1            Now, what is the evidence in the statute of
 2       limitations?  Dr. Bagnoli told that she was first
 3       diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
 4       in 1991.  That's within the statute of limitations.
 5       That affirmative defense doesn't apply.  It doesn't
 6       bar her claim.
 7            But they have argued throughout -- and you've
 8       seen it when they've asked questions of witnesses --
 9       that she should have known it earlier.  That's why
10       they asked all those questions.  They were trying to
11       set up a claim to bar her from bringing this suit in
12       the first place.
13            And they suggested that because she had a
14       smoker's cough earlier, that she should have known
15       she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease long
16       before it was ever diagnosed, that she should have
17       known she had a claim long before the claim was
18       brought.
19            The Court will instruct you that, fortunately,
20       under Florida law there's what's called a discovery
21       rule; that is, the statute of limitations only
22       starts to run when you should have discovered two
23       things; one, that you were injured by their conduct,
24       that is, that the chronic obstructive pulmonary
25       disease had occurred.  And we know that no one told

 1       her that until 1991; and two, that she had a claim
 2       against them for causing her chronic obstructive
 3       pulmonary disease.
 4            And you will have on the verdict form a
 5       specific question to answer on that issue.  If we
 6       can bring that back up.  You saw on the verdict form
 7       we originally had the first question dealt with her
 8       class membership, that is whether she was addicted.
 9            The second question you're going to have to
10       answer is did Evelyn Warrick know or should she have
11       known after the exercise of reasonable diligence --
12       that's the discovery -- that she suffered from
13       chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, COPD, and
14       that she had a claim for damages against these
15       defendants for her chronic obstructive pulmonary
16       disease prior to May 5, 1990?
17            The answer under that evidence is no.  She did
18       not know.  There is no basis for their affirmative
19       defense.  You need to answer that question no, so
20       that you can proceed with this case.
21            The great irony here is that they had filed a
22       defense to bar her claim claiming that she should
23       have known that the chronic obstructive pulmonary
24       disease was caused by her smoking and that she had a
25       claim against them.  10 years before they admitted

 1       that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was
 2       caused by smoking.
 3            The great irony here is they want you to blame
 4       her for knowing something they claim to not know.
 5            The great irony here is that they in effect are 6       saying bar her claim because she should have known
 7       we were lying.
 8            The next item you're going to have to deal with
 9       are damages.  And I'm going to turn to my colleague,
10       Rick Block, to explain the damages issue.


 9            MR. BLOCK:  Thank you.  May it please the
10       Court?  Counsel?  Counsel?
11            Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.
12            THE JURY:  Good morning.
13            MR. BLOCK:  I'm going to talk about damages,
14       and you know what that means, math.  More math from
15       me, can you believe it?  I don't know that Mr.
16       Reilly has proven much, but one of the things he's
17       absolutely proven in this case is that Rick Block
18       stinks at math, so for that reason I'd like to thank
19       my staff for doing the math in the presentation that
20       we're about to see on damages because the math shows
21       a lot.  Millions.  Isn't that the point?
22            Outrageous conduct results in huge, huge
23       damages.  Isn't that the point?
24            I, too, would like to thank you for your time.
25       Some of you have used multiple notebooks we've

 1       noticed.  That's great.  You're paying attention,
 2       you're writing notes.  Some of this trial was very
 3       exciting and fun, a lot of it was very, very boring
 4       and you paid attention throughout and we thank you
 5       for your time, we thank you for your attention and
 6       we thank you for caring.
 7            If you can remember the very first thing that I
 8       told you on the very first day when you started jury
 9       selection, the first words out of my mouth were this
10       is an important case.  And now you know why.
11            I'm not going to report -- or repeat what Mr.
12       Shields has covered.  What I'm going to talk about
13       is damages.  And you bet, it's millions and millions
14       of damages.  And let me -- millions of dollars in
15       damage.
16            Let me talk about that for a second because we 17       kind of touched on this in jury selection about how
18       you all sat through this trial and you have seen the
19       mountain of evidence, tragically through a screen
20       you got to meet Evelyn Warrick only.  Other people
21       that work with you, they're at the water cooler,
22       they weren't here.  They didn't hear the evidence.
23       It's not about that.  It's about the greater weight
24       of the evidence.  I've got the scales of justice
25       down here.  Remember, I brought them out in jury

 1       selection.  And it's just the greater weight of the
 2       evidence.  It's not about what other people think.
 3       It's about the evidence and the law that the judge
 4       is going to instruct you.
 5            And we are going to compare with numbers what
 6       this case is all about, because the facts are,
 7       Ladies and Gentlemen, what they manufactured, what
 8       they produced, what they advertised, what they sold
 9       very quickly addicted a 13-year-old little girl back
10       in 1949.  What they manufactured and produced and
11       and advertised and sold filled her lungs with the
12       dangerous and deadly addictive nicotine.  P.
13            I don't start out by accident with this number.
14       Remember this number?  I messed up the math, but
15       their expert didn't.  Remember she's the one that
16       gave you by 1970 when they came she would have quit,
17       she wouldn't have got the COPD, she had 1.5 million
18       doses of nicotine by the time she was 34 years old.
19       She's been addicted for years by them.  That was
20       common sense.  It addicted her body.  It addicted
21       her brain.  It addicted her mind.  And it addicted
22       per spirit.  It resulted in premature death after 19
23       years of suffering.
24            And that's what I'm going to talk about.
25       Because what they manufactured, what they produced,

 1       what they advertised, what they sold made her sick,
 2       and we're going to talk about sickness.
 3            What they manufactured and produced and
 4       advertised and sold made her suffer, and we're going
 5       to talk about those damages.
 6            What they manufactured and produced and
 7       advertised and sold took from her her ability to
 8       make informed choices.  That's the very essence of
 9       addiction.
10            What they manufactured, what they produced,
11       what they advertised and what they sold literally
12       stole her breath away.
13            What they manufactured, produced, advertised
14       and sold and then lied about killed her.
15            And even now on August the 2nd of 2010, they
16       refuse to take any responsibility, not 1 percent.
17       Is that okay with you?  We're going to find out.
18       Justice is on your watch today.
19            60 years of her life affected by their
20       cigarettes.  At least 50 years of that addicted to
21       their cigarettes.  50 years of feeding the addiction
22       that they created.  50 years of Evelyn Warrick's
23       addiction and 50 years of their denial create doubt.
24       Keep her addicted.  Give here a coupon.  Give her a
25       couple of free cartons.  Feed her more nicotine.

 1       Make it glamorous.  Make it sexy.  Deny the danger. 2       Keep her addicted.  And then let's blame her because
 3       she shouldn't have listened to us when we denied it.
 4       Is that okay with you?
 5            You know, one of the damages we're going to
 6       consider is her -- is Evelyn Warrick's mental
 7       anguish because as briefly as Mr. Shields told you,
 8       if you find that she died as a result of
 9       smoking-related illness, then there's a certain
10       amount of damages that I'll explain in a minute
11       called wrongful death damages.  If you find some
12       unrelated heart thing killed her, then it's survival
13       damages.  And one of those damages is Evelyn
14       Warrick's mental damage.  And how did she feel
15       emotionally about what they had done to her and then
16       refused to take any responsibility for the painful
17       and frightening deadly effects of what they sold to
18       her for 50 years.  You saw her and you met her in
19       the only way you could.
20            Since she was first diagnosed with COPD in
21       1991, what evidence was there that she was diagnosed
22       by anybody on the planet, one medical report, one
23       doctor, a nurse, a physician's assistant -- did
24       anybody ever tell that woman that she had COPD
25       before 1991?  Not one shred of evidence.

 1            And back to Mr. Shields and what he's already
 2       told you about their om the claim of statute
 3       limitations.  I am not going to comment further on
 4       that.  What I am going to say is that when she was
 5       first diagnosed in 1991 with -- and here comes the
 6       math -- with COPD, there's been 19 years of illness,
 7       19 years of restricted breathing, 19 years of lung
 8       and respiratory congestion, 19 years of medical
 9       care, 19 years of medical bills, 19 years of
10       chronic, daily, serious illness which is COPD.  And
11       you don't have to believe us, their doctors told you
12       that.  Their doctors told you it takes your breath
13       away.  You're suffocating.  That's what their
14       doctors said, all caused by their cigarettes.
15       There's no dispute in this case about that.
16            There is no dispute in this case that her COPD
17       was caused by her cigarettes.  There is no dispute
18       in this case that her lung cancer was caused by the
19       cigarettes.  If there were, Mr. Reilly would be out
20       of his chair objecting because I wouldn't be making
21       appropriate argument.  There is no dispute about
22       that.
23            19 years of what amounts to progressive
24       suffocation.  And they still refuse to accept 1
25       percent of fault, not 1.

 1            So what are the value of the damages caused by
 2       their conduct?  And I just want to say one word
 3       about that.  Mr. Reilly in his opening statement did
 4       talk about Evelyn Warrick and people around her
 5       getting sick, and, of course, we talked about
 6       addiction and why the very essence of addiction is
 7       you think, well, it's not going to happen to me.  In
 8       his whole opening statement all he had to say about
 9       the cigarette industry was that at some time between
10       1950 and 2000 they made a couple of bad decisions.
11       Really?  Really?  A couple of bad decisions, really?
12       When in the history of the world has so many people 13       died as a result of a couple of bad decisions?
14            Let's talk about the damages to Evelyn Warrick.
15       We are going to talk about millions and millions of
16       dollars.  And I'm not apologizing for that.  We
17       don't need to be apologetic on this side of the
18       room.  They're the ones who -- and let's talk --
19       before we talk about specific money, let's talk
20       about money in general.
21            If you remember -- and I don't know what to
22       think about this, but in this country and in this
23       state and in this courtroom during jury selection,
24       when we talked about lawsuits and fraudulent
25       concealment and conspiracy, everybody's up to the

 1       task, ready to weigh the evidence and assign
 2       responsibility where it lays.  But when it comes
 3       time for paying for it, the room gets quiet, doesn't
 4       it?  Remember in jury selection when we started
 5       talking about money damages, people got really,
 6       really quiet.
 7            And I'm sure that when Mr. Reilly and Mr.
 8       Engram get up here they're going to try and make us
 9       look greedy or assassinate our character because we
10       dare to ask you for millions of dollars.
11            MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.
12            THE COURT:  All right.  You want to approach
13       the sidebar.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
 2            THE COURT:  All right.
 3            MR. BLOCK:  Proceed?  All right.  We're going
 4       to see in a few minutes about what Mr. Reilly and
 5       Mr. Engram have to say about the millions of dollars
 6       and blaming the victim.  We're going to see if
 7       you're willing to do that.
 8            Because clearly what's happened for the last 75
 9       years has been deflect attention away from the party
10       that manufactured, produced, advertised and sold the
11       product and blame the party who is so audacious as
12       to actually buy it and use it.  Attack the victim.
13       But the victim isn't the one that made, advertised,
14       produced and sold products that cause low -- I'm
15       sorry, that cause long, slow, painful, terrifying
16       death.  They did.
17            You know, Evelyn Warrick experienced -- and you
18       know about it -- so much pain and so much suffering
19       and so much fear and ultimately her death to be
20       argued all in the name of corporate profit to then
21       blame their customer.
22            You were chosen in this case, you were chosen
23       at this time, and we're going to see by your verdict
24       how well this jury follows the law, follows the
25       evidence in this case, which is all we ask you to

 1       do.
 2            MR. REILLY:  Objection, Your Honor.  This is
 3       improper argument.
 4            THE COURT:  Would you approach the sidebar
 5       again.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
 6            THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Block.  Deanne, are
 7       you ready?
 8            THE REPORTER:  Yes, sir.
 9            THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.
10            MR. BLOCK:  We ask that you follow the law
11       which the judge is going to instruct you in a little
12       while.  And we ask you to follow the facts and the
13       evidence that you sat very patiently and sifted
14       through for the last almost four weeks.  We ask for
15       full justice because partial justice is no justice
16       at all.
17            And what does that mean?  Well, let's get to
18       the math.  Here's some math.  This trial started 22
19       days ago.  You all have been forced to live with 20       this incident for 22 days.  That's 528 hours.
21       That's a long time, isn't it?  I bet it has felt
22       like a long time.
23            Evelyn and Calvin Warrick were forced to live
24       with this tragedy for 19 years.  19 years, that's
25       6,935 days.  That's 166,440 hours.  That was the

 1       length of Evelyn Warrick's tragedy.  And we ask you
 2       for full and fair reimbursement for every single one
 3       of those hours because partial justice is no justice
 4       at all.  Anything less would be unjust.  One hour
 5       less would be unjust.  Damages add up after 19
 6       years, hour after hour and day after day.
 7            And remember, we talked about this in jury
 8       selection.  I asked the question, do you all agree
 9       that compensating someone or reimbursing somebody by
10       the hour -- that's what we do in this country, most
11       of us get paid by the hour.  You remember that
12       discussion that we had?  I asked you for that
13       reason.  And everybody agreed that the most fair way
14       to reimburse -- and we're going to talk about it
15       specifically in just a minute -- for these types of
16       injuries and damages and losses is by the hour, so
17       we just ask you to go by whatever the way --
18       whatever the evidence was.
19            And in a few minutes you will be going back and
20       deliberating, you'll be making whatever verdict that
21       you make and your jury service on this case will
22       end, but for Evelyn Warrick it ended on February 7th
23       of this year.  And it ended ugly.  It ended for her
24       with her ashes being carried around by her beloved
25       husband for 50 years in a locket that he wears.  It

 1       ended for her with her husband of 50 years wearing
 2       her thumbprint around his neck on a chain every day.
 3       What's that worth?  How in the world do you
 4       calculate such a thing?
 5            I think we can all agree this case isn't about
 6       spilled coffee, is it?  And it ain't about chocolate
 7       and it ain't about donuts.  It's about a human
 8       being.
 9            Let's talk about whether or not this is a
10       wrongful death claim or a survival claim.  As Mr.
11       Shields told you, it's one of the two.  After you
12       find that she -- that Evelyn Warrick was a member of
13       the class, because clearly that she was addicted to
14       cigarettes which was a legal cause of her COPD, you
15       will determine did she die of a smoking-related
16       illness.  And if the answer to that is yes, it's a
17       wrongful death claim.  If the answer to that is no,
18       it's a survival claim.  And we don't know how you're
19       going to feel about that so I have to cover both.
20       All right?  Then we'll get to the issue of
21       comparative negligence.
22            Now, you've heard a lot about comparative
23       negligence.  And I'm going to actually get into the
24       specifics of it, but comparative negligence is a
25       defense that is raised by them.  They have the

 1       burden of proving the degree that Mrs. Warrick was
 2       herself comparatively at fault, which we agree to a
 3       small degree that she was when you compare what they
 4       knew and what she knew and what they did compared to 5       what she did, and -- but it's important that you
 6       understand you do not reduce her damages.  The Court
 7       will do that after you all leave.  So whatever the
 8       damages, whatever the greater weight of the damages
 9       are, you award the full amount of the damages caused
10       by their conduct.  And after you leave, if you were
11       to find that she was a particular percentage at
12       fault, His Honor will reduce your award by that
13       amount.  Everybody understand that, okay?
14            For instance, let's just say that -- and you're
15       going to have a form that's going to have some
16       blanks like that.  Let's just say that you determine
17       that R.J. Reynolds in this case is 45 percent
18       negligent.  You would write down or 45 percent at
19       fault, 45 percent responsible --
20            Ma'am, can you not see that?
21            A JUROR:  I can't see that.
22            MR. BLOCK:  Let's do this this way.  See it
23       now?
24            A JUROR:  Yes.
25            MR. BLOCK:  I'm sorry about that.

 1            And after weighing the evidence, you determine
 2       that Philip Morris USA is 45 percent at fault.  Even
 3       my poor math skills tells me that's about 90
 4       percent, so that would then leave Evelyn Warrick at
 5       10 percent at fault and you're going to fill in
 6       numbers like that.
 7            Now, I'm not suggesting that Evelyn Warrick was
 8       10 percent at fault.  I'm just using this as nice
 9       round numbers.
10            What would happen is you would still -- after
11       this you then go through the verdict form, as we're
12       getting ready to do, award all of the damages that
13       are proven by the greater weight of the evidence to
14       have resulted from their conduct.  And then after
15       you leave, His Honor would reduce by 10 percent
16       those causes of action to which comparative
17       negligence is applicable.  Does everybody understand
18       that?  All right.
19            All right.  Now, that you know that you award
20       all of the damages by the greater weight of the
21       evidence that were caused by their conduct, let's go
22       through the damages.
23            Okay.  First slide, please.  Each category of
24       loss, injury and damage must have been legally
25       caused by the conduct of these tobacco companies,

 1       and that's all we're asking.
 2            Each category of loss, injury and damage must
 3       be considered by you and reimbursed individually.
 4            Now, we're going to go through a bunch
 5       categories.  Each category of loss is separate and
 6       distinct from the others.  You may find that there
 7       was zero loss of enjoyment of life, but $50 million
 8       in pain and suffering, okay?  Each -- each category
 9       rises and falls on its own merit and will be
10       considered by you individually, okay?
11            Each category will be fully reimbursed -- fully
12       reimbursed based on the greater weight of the
13       evidence.
14            All right.  Wrongful death or survival claim.
15       You must determine, based on the greater weight of 16       the evidence, whether her death on February 7, 2010,
17       was caused by either one or a combination of her
18       smoking-related illnesses, which, of course, are
19       COPD and lung cancer.  If the answer to that is yes,
20       then you should award all the damages shown by the
21       greater weight of the evidence as specified on the
22       wrongful death damages section on the verdict form.
23            Now, the way this is going to work is His
24       Honor's going to give you a verdict form that you're
25       going to go in the back and you're going to make the

 1       determinations.  And if you find she's a member of
 2       the class, and if you find that the statute of
 3       limitations is not applicable to this case, then you
 4       will come back out after determining whether it's is
 5       a survival claim or wrongful death and His Honor
 6       will then give you either the wrongful death damage
 7       form or the survival damage form, okay?  But I don't
 8       know how that's going to work so I have to cover
 9       both.
10            So with the way it works is was Evelyn
11       Warrick's death caused by either one or a
12       combination of these illnesses?  Well, if the answer
13       to that is yes, then it's a wrongful death damages.
14       And the Court's going to instruct you that the
15       estate of Evelyn Warrick is entitled to the medical
16       bills which are 680- -- well, we'll get to at that
17       in a minute.  Medical bills, funeral expenses,
18       Calvin Warrick's loss of support and services of his
19       wife, Calvin Warrick's loss of companionship, mental
20       pain and suffering.  That's what you would determine
21       based on a wrongful death claim.
22            If you determine she did not die as a result of
23       either one of or both of her smoking-related
24       illnesses, then it's a survival claim and you will
25       -- and you will look at these damages.  Medical

 1       bills, pain and suffering, mental -- this is all
 2       from Evelyn Warrick's perspective -- mental anguish,
 3       loss of the enjoyment of life, inconvenience,
 4       physical impairment and aggravation of a preexisting
 5       condition.
 6            Now, here's something that's really kind of
 7       interesting.  I predict that Mr. Engram, at least,
 8       is going to get up here and spend a great deal of
 9       time trying to convince you that Evelyn Warrick
10       didn't die of smoking-related illnesses, and,
11       therefore, you shouldn't -- it's not going to be a
12       wrongful death claim, it's going to be a survival
13       claim.  And the interesting thing about that, the
14       survival claim is more valuable.  It could be argued
15       that it would be in our benefit for you to find the
16       survival action damages because they're going to be
17       a lot more money than the wrongful death when we add
18       them all up.  But the truth of the matter is she
19       died of smoking-related illnesses.  I just think
20       it's interesting that the tobacco company is going
21       to argue to the contrary.
22            So in the verdict form, question 1 Mr. Shields
23       has already gone through with you on the class
24       membership.
25            Question 2 is the statute of limitations does
5026 1       not an apply.
 2            Number 3 is, was her lung cancer a legal
 3       cause -- and by the way it doesn't say the legal
 4       cause -- a legal cause of her death?  And was Evelyn
 5       Warrick's COPD a legal cause of her death?
 6            The evidence in this case is both of those
 7       should be checked yes, but you all decide.  If you
 8       decide the answer is no, then we're in a survival
 9       claim, which I'm going to show you in a few minutes
10       is more valuable than the wrongful death claim.
11            All right.  Let's keep moving.  The medical
12       bills in evidence are uncontradicted.  Can you go
13       back to the previous slide.  What I want to do is go
14       through the wrongful both -- one more, I'm sorry --
15       go through these wrongful death damages starting
16       with the medical bills.  Sorry about that.
17            The medical bills in evidence are
18       uncontradicted.  The tobacco companies offered you
19       zero evidence to contradict the fact that all of her
20       medical costs were caused by her smoking-related
21       illnesses.  We put it all into evidence.  Here it
22       is.  683,000 -- I said it wrong.  Let me try again.
23       $683,682.27, and we ask you to award it now.
24       $683,682.27 and we ask you to award this now.  It's
25       uncontradicted.

 1            And when you get to the verdict form -- and
 2       again it's kind of hard because there's several
 3       verdict forms, so what we've done is just flown in
 4       the actual question.  What is the total amount of
 5       damages from July 1991 through today?  And there's
 6       the number, okay?
 7            So having no problem with the medical bills
 8       because they're uncontradicted, we move to the
 9       funeral expenses.  Well, that's pretty easy, too,
10       because there is absolutely no evidence to
11       contradict the fact that her funeral expenses
12       totaled $2,692.49, and we ask you to award it now.
13            The interesting thing you're going to see in
14       just a few minutes, Ladies and Gentlemen, is that
15       both of these damages are also collectable on the --
16       well, the funeral expenses aren't, but all of her
17       medical bills apply to the survival action.  But
18       we'll get to that in a minute.
19            So let's keep moving down the line.  And we go
20       to the verdict form.  There it is.  We ask you to
21       make that award if you find that she died of
22       smoking-related illness.
23            Let's go to -- we go back -- you notice that
24       the rest of those damages in wrongful death apply to
25       Calvin Warrick for the loss of his wife.  So the

 1       first one -- and if you remember, we brought you Gil
 2       Spruance on the loss of support and services.  You
 3       remember?  You may remember that the tobacco
 4       companies brought you nobody.  Pthe only -- the only
 5       witness that you've heard in this case -- and again
 6       we're talking about the greater weight of the
 7       evidence, it's the only evidence in this case -- is
 8       you heard from Gil Spruance.
 9            And what he told you is that the reasonable
10       value -- and he said I'm only going to go back 18
11       months.  But the reasonable value of the support and 12       services from about 18 months ago when Evelyn
13       Warrick really started getting to such a progressed
14       percentage of disability that she couldn't care for
15       her husband, who obviously needs a lot of care, that
16       comes out to $162,000; okay?
17            It should be noted that all of the amounts that
18       Mr. Spruance explained to you only goes back 18
19       months.  What he told you is those damages actually
20       go back longer than 18 months, but he could only
21       fairly quantify them for the 18 months.
22            And there's also another interesting thing.
23       Remember when Mr. Latham got up and he said, let's
24       talk about what you're not here to do, Mr. Spruance.
25       And I got up and said, yeah, let's talk about what

 1       you're not here to do, because there's a whole bunch
 2       of other damages that you're not here to quantify,
 3       remember that?  And that's what's we're getting
 4       ready to talk about now.
 5            We ask you to award that 162,000 under the
 6       appropriate heading.
 7            Now, the next item of damage under the wrongful
 8       death act that you are to consider would be Calvin
 9       Warrick's loss of companionship, mental pain and
10       suffering.  If you -- if you determine that Evelyn
11       Warrick died as a result of either lung cancer or
12       COPD, or both, her estate is entitled to full and
13       fair reimbursement for all of Calvin Warrick's loss
14       of companionship and mental pain and suffering from
15       July 1991 until today.
16            You may ask yourself why July 1991?  Because
17       she only just died, and what if she died from the --
18       from the lung cancer?  That -- the wrongful death
19       damages go back to the date of the original injury,
20       which would be when she was diagnosed with the COPD
21       in 1991, okay?
22            Well, what does that mean?  We know that July
23       1991 until today equals 19 years.  What is the
24       evidence regarding Calvin Warrick's loss of
25       companionship and pain and suffering?  We know Mr.

 1       Warrick is legally blind.  He's hard of hearing.
 2       He's in extremely poor health.  He was married to
 3       the same woman for over 50 years.  He was devastated
 4       by her COPD and lung cancer.  He still wears her
 5       thumbprint around his neck.  He carries with him
 6       everywhere a small amount of his wife's ashes in a
 7       heart-shaped locket.  She was his entire life.
 8       Well, how do you calculate such things?  Well, we
 9       expect His Honor to instruct you that there's no
10       precise formula that you have to use to determine
11       any of these types of damages; however, the parties
12       are permitted to suggest certain methods of
13       calculating these damages, which makes sense, based
14       upon the greater weight of the evidence and common
15       sense.
16            Again, remember when we talked about being
17       compensated or reimbursed by the hour, that's why I
18       asked you those questions.  There is no more fair
19       way to determine these types of damages than by
20       whatever the greater weight of the evidence showed
21       on an hourly basis.
22            So how does that work?  Well, common sense. 23       You take the number of hours per day for whichever
24       type of loss we're talking about, whatever the
25       greater weight of the evidence showed, you multiply

 1       that times the number of days per year for that
 2       certain type of damage based on whatever the greater
 3       weight of the evidence showed, you multiply that
 4       times 19 years, because we know it all goes back 19
 5       years.  And then you have to decide how many dollars
 6       an hour is fair for that type of loss.  Makes sense.
 7       A lot of math, but it makes sense.
 8            Well, let's apply that to each category of
 9       damage.  And the first category of damage is Calvin
10       Warrick's loss of companionship and protection.  We
11       know we're asking for 7.5 hours a day.  Why is that?
12       Because we figure they were together probably 15
13       hours a day awake.  If you take half of that,
14       because we're going to cover the other half in just
15       a few minutes, the number of days per year, the only
16       evidence in this case is every day.  There was no
17       other evidence in this case.  That's the only
18       evidence, times 19 years times the number of dollars
19       per hour.  And I'm going to talk about that in a few
20       minutes.  That's ultimately going to be up to you,
21       but I'm going to suggest something to you in a
22       minute.
23            So if you take -- and we've done the math for
24       you it's 52,012 and half hours times whatever amount
25       you think is fair under the circumstances.  That's

 1       for loss of companionship and protection.
 2            Now, obviously if you decide that $10 an hour
 3       is fair -- and I'm going to talk about money in just
 4       a minute, but just to tell you where we're going.
 5       If you decided that $10 an hour is fair for that
 6       type of loss, it's $520,000 for 19 years of it.
 7            Let's move forward.  So we show his -- go
 8       ahead.  Now, we're going to the mental pain and
 9       suffering calculation.  Again if you split that 15
10       hours in half, here's the other 7-and-a-half hours.
11       We know the mental pain and suffering, he was
12       devastated by his wife's illnesses, there's no doubt
13       about that.  Every day, there's no doubt about that.
14       19 years, there's no doubt about that.  It's not
15       even a close call.  Times however many dollars an
16       hour you decide for mental pain and suffering of
17       Calvin Warrick.   And we come up with the 52,000
18       hours times however many dollars you decide, okay?
19            Let's move forward.  So what we know is on the
20       verdict form you're going to see the loss of support
21       and services, the only evidence is $162,000.  They
22       brought you nobody to refute that.  We suggest that
23       the loss of companionship and protection and the
24       mental pain and suffering each, if you take 15 hours
25       a day, split it in half, comes to about 52,000 hours

 1       over 19 years, and you can multiply that however
 2       many dollars an hour you think is fair.
 3            Okay.  Let's move forward.  Go ahead.  So to
 4       summarize wrongful death damages, we know the
 5       medical bills are $683,682.27, funeral expenses are
 6       2,692.49, his loss of support and services we know
 7       is 162,000, his loss of companionship and protection 8       and mental pain and suffering is 52,000 hours for
 9       the companionship and 52,000 hours for the mental
10       pain and suffering times however many dollars an
11       hour you think is fair.  That concludes the wrongful
12       death damages.  And that's how it's going to look on
13       that particular verdict form.
14            And then what you will do after you figure how
15       many dollars an hour to fill in that blank, you'll
16       add it up and that goes there -- and the verdict
17       form tells you to answer this question, you'll add
18       A, B, C, 9(a) and 9(b).
19            Okay.  So let's go back to our fundamental
20       question.  Did either of her smoking-related
21       illnesses cause her death.  We've already covered
22       the wrongful death damages if the answer is yes.  If
23       you decide -- and here's the irony of R.J. Reynolds
24       trying to convince you that she really didn't die of
25       a smoking-related illness, we're then over here in

 1       the survival action damages.  And what are they?
 2       Let's go through it.
 3            Okay.  Again if you go back to that fundamental
 4       question you'll answer, if you answer no to number
 5       3, that the lung cancer was not a legal cause of her
 6       death, and no to COPD, was that a legal cause of her
 7       death, then we're into the survival claim, okay?
 8       Excuse me.
 9            If you find that this is a survival action,
10       then the following calculations should be made.
11            Number 1, medical bills.  Again the same
12       medical bills apply, which is $683,682.27, so that
13       figure is going to apply either way, whether it's a
14       wrongful death action or whether it's a survival
15       action, and we ask you to award it now.  You'll see
16       on the verdict form.  That's from the survival
17       action verdict form.
18            Let's go to the next line, so we know that the
19       medical bills are going to be awarded under survival
20       action.  Well, now we take into account Evelyn
21       Warrick's pain and suffering, her mental anguish,
22       her loss of enjoyment of life, her inconvenience,
23       her physical impairment, her aggravation of a
24       preexisting condition, all calculated from 1991 in
25       July when she was diagnosed with COPD until she died

 1       on February 7th, if this is a survival action,
 2       February 7th of 2010.
 3            So we go back to our verdict form.  And we know
 4       that the medical bills are appropriate, which is the
 5       683,000.  Now let's talk about her pain and
 6       suffering.
 7            Can we turn the lights off for one minute, Your
 8       Honor?
 9            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Shaffer.
10            MR. BLOCK:  The human condition.  Evelyn
11       Warrick, a human being.  What did you hear about
12       this picture?  She was working with her churches and
13       her seamen's center and then she finally got a new
14       van.  That was a big deal.  Look at her.  Well, how
15       did their product effect her?  Let's move forward.
16       God.  That is May 21st of 2009.  You think she
17       underwent any pain and suffering?  How about the
18       next time she was deposed.  How about the next 19       time --
20            A VOICE:  That's it.
21            MR. BLOCK:  A picture speaks a thousand words.
22       That's what their product does to people.  That's
23       what it did to her.  P.
24            Thank you, Mr. Shaffer.
25            It's extremely reasonable to conclude that

 1       Evelyn Warrick experienced 10 to 20 hours a day of
 2       pain and suffering as a result of her
 3       smoking-related illnesses.  Now, to be fair, it's
 4       probably a little bit less than that when she was
 5       first diagnosed in 1991.  But look at those
 6       pictures, and common sense tells you it was a whole
 7       lot more than that during the last years of her
 8       life.  We ask you to award an average of 15 hours a
 9       day, so let's go back to our math.
10            15 hours a day times every single day --
11       there's no other evidence.  Do you think she looked
12       any different on those days than any other day?
13       Times 19 years times how many dollars an hour you
14       feel is fair.
15            We know that if you do the math it's going to
16       come up to -- click for me -- 104,025 hours from
17       1991 until February 7th of this year of her pain and
18       suffering.  And all you have to decide is how many
19       dollars an hour that's worth.  We'll talk about that
20       in a minute.
21            So we go back to the verdict form, and there it
22       is.  So you've awarded the medical bills, now you've
23       got the pain and suffering.  However, you decide
24       that hourly figure, we will gratefully accept.
25            Mental anguish.  What was the evidence of

 1       Evelyn Warrick's mental anguish?  We know that she
 2       suffered substantial mental anguish as a result of
 3       painful and frightening COPD and lung cancer.  It is
 4       extremely conservative and reasonable conclude that
 5       she experienced three to five hours per day of
 6       mental anguish.  We ask you to award her estate an
 7       average of 3-and-a-half hours per day from 19 --
 8       July 1991 through February 2010.
 9            And let's do the math.  3 and a half hours a
10       day, entirely reasonable, 365 days per year, 19
11       years times however many dollars an hour you think
12       that Evelyn Warrick's mental anguish is fair to be
13       reimbursed.  That's 24,272 and a half hours times --
14       again, if you decide $10 an hour that's $240,000.
15            See, how this survival claim is a whole lot
16       more valuable in terms of dollars than the wrongful
17       death claim?  And, yet, tobacco wants you to believe
18       it's a wrongful death -- I'm sorry, wants you to
19       believe it's not a wrongful death.
20            All right.  So we go back to the verdict form.
21       And you fill in the blank and you move to loss of
22       enjoyment of life.  Well, what was the evidence as
23       loss of enjoyment of life?
24            You know, it took three-and-a-half weeks to try
25       this case because we needed to provide you all of

 1       this evidence.  What did you hear?  You know, she
 2       absolutely loved her church.  She loved her arts and
 3       crafts.  When -- when -- 4            How many people make arts and crafts out of
 5       cigarette boxes?  How many people -- the flower?
 6       How many people make cute little handy things out of
 7       cigarette wrappers -- the inside lining of
 8       cigarettes?  You think she was addicted?
 9            Her seamen's center, she told you that she --
10       with her family she started this center for
11       seamen -- foreign seamen to have a place to come and
12       she talked about her 104 churches, and most of all,
13       her beloved husband, Calvin.  All of these were lost
14       as a result of her smoking-related illnesses and it
15       is certainly reasonable to ask you to award two to
16       three hours per day of loss of enjoyment of life.
17            Let's do the math.  Two-and-a-half hours a day
18       times every day, which obviously it was, times 19
19       years times the number of dollars per hour comes to
20       17,337-and-a-half hours times however many dollars
21       you decide.
22            And, again, early on in 1991 was her loss of
23       enjoyment of life less than two-and-a-half hours?
24       Probably, but you certainly saw at the end of her
25       life she lost it all.  So that's loss of enjoyment

 1       of life based on the greater weight of the evidence,
 2       and we ask you to fill it in at the appropriate
 3       blank on the verdict form.
 4            Let's go to inconvenience.  One of categories
 5       of loss that judge --
 6            And, Judge, I think I have about 10 more
 7       minutes.
 8            THE COURT:  All right.
 9            MR. BLOCK:  Okay.  One of the damages that the
10       judge is going to talk to you about is
11       inconvenience.  Well, you look no further than her
12       medical records in this case -- well, I can't carry
13       them all.  You think she was inconvenienced by her
14       smoking-related illnesses?  Chemotherapy, radiation.
15       It is certainly reasonable to conclude that she
16       experienced three to four hours day of inconvenience
17       for those 19 years.  Once again, probably less in
18       the beginning, but certainly way more than that at
19       the end.  We ask you for three-and-a-half hours per
20       day inconvenience.
21            If you do the math -- go ahead, Cheryl, and
22       scroll on down -- it's 24,272-and-a-half hours times
23       however many dollars you decide.  And we ask you to
24       fill out the verdict form as to the inconvenience.
25            Now, let's go to physical impairment meant and

 1       disability.  This is easy.  Why is it easy?  Because
 2       we know she was diagnosed for the first time in COPD
 3       in 1991.  Once she's diagnosed, she's physically
 4       impaired 24 hours a day.  She's physically got the
 5       disease 24 hours a day, so it's real easy, although
 6       it's a being number.  Because it's 24 hours a day
 7       times 365 days a year for the 19 years, it comes out
 8       to 166,440 hours of her disability.  But you know
 9       what?  That's the easiest number to justify because
10       obviously she's physically impaired 24 hours a day,
11       so we ask you to fill that number in on the verdict
12       form.
13            Finally, we talked about aggravation of a
14       preexisting condition.  Now, here's where it gets a 15       little bit tricky because there's no question but
16       that her lung cancer aggravated what was already a
17       bad condition with COPD, so that would be 24 hours a
18       day; however, in all fairness, she wasn't diagnosed
19       with lung cancer until 2009, so we're only asking
20       for one year of aggravation, only asking for one
21       year.  And if you do the math, it's 24 hours a day
22       365 days a year for one year for the aggravation of
23       the preexisting condition because she was only
24       diagnosed with the lung cancer last year.  And the
25       number comes out to 8,760 hours times however many

 1       dollars an hour you think is fair fire that you
 2       reimburse Evelyn Warrick for the degree that that
 3       lung cancer had on her condition of COPD.  We ask
 4       you to award that.
 5            Now, I told you to finish up and thank you for
 6       your patience and your attention that we would talk
 7       about -- the only thing that's left for you to
 8       decide, we've all said the fairest way to determine
 9       is by reimbursement by the hour, that's the greater
10       weight of the evidence, no question about it, and
11       most -- most categories it's the only evidence.
12       Well, how many dollars an hour is fair?  Well, we
13       would suggest to you that it would be reasonable to
14       award her 20 to $30 -- her estate 20 to $30 an hour
15       for each hour of pain and suffering for each hour of
16       mental anguish, loss of the enjoyment of life,
17       physical impairment or disability, inconvenience,
18       aggravation of a preexisting condition.
19            We ask you to use your conscious.  We ask you
20       to use your common sense.  We ask you to apply the
21       law as His Honor, Judge Mitchell, is about to
22       instruct you.  We ask you to use good old fashioned
23       common sense.  And certainly it would not be less
24       than $10 an hour.  If you decide it's $20 an hour or
25       $30 an hour, then you decide.

 1            Please understand, we told you about this in
 2       jury selection, this is not about trying to put a
 3       value on this woman's life because that cannot be
 4       done.  That's not what this case is about.
 5            This is about awarding full and fair
 6       reimbursement to her estate for each category of
 7       loss, injury and damage caused by what they their
 8       product did to her.
 9            This is Evelyn Warrick's only day in court.  If
10       it's a survival claim, you judge it by how it
11       effected her.
12            One moment, Your Honor.
13            Can I have the lights, please?  I'm going to
14       sit down.  And I thank you for your -- this is the
15       last time I get to talk to you.  You all have done a
16       lot of hard work sitting through lawyers' fightng
17       being and lots of very, sometimes, boring evidence,
18       but this is an important case.  You know why?  I'll
19       tell you why.  We're talking about a human being.
20            Go back to the first one, please.  That's what
21       she had a right to be.  Move forward.  That's what
22       she became.  It's wrong.  They know it's wrong.  You
23       know it's wrong.  And we ask you to do something
24       about it.


10            MR. SHIELDS:  I suppose I should say good
11       evening now instead of good morning.  It's been a
12       long trial and it's been a long day.  I'm tired.  I
13       suspect you're tired, but this is important stuff.
14       So we're going to take a little more time.  I will
15       do my best to get through it as quickly as we can.
16       I'm not going to take the time to respond to
17       everything that the defense has said in the last
18       four hours.  We don't want to be here until 9:00
19       o'clock tonight.
20            I will hit some of the major points, though,
21       and rely upon you and what you heard in the opening 22       portion to be able to respond otherwise.
23            Let me begin by making a couple of
24       observations.  First, there is -- has been almost no
25       discussion by defense counsel of the decades-long

 1       conspiracy of denial, deceit, obstruction and
 2       concealment.  Instead they try and act like it has
 3       nothing to do with this lawsuit.
 4            Mr. Reilly gets up and shows you a timeline
 5       starting in 1949 and running through Mrs. Warrick's
 6       life and doesn't put anything on it, about all of
 7       the things that they did during the course of her
 8       life as part of their campaign and their conspiracy.
 9            Mr. Engram gets up and says, "We're not trying
10       the same case.  That doesn't have anything to do
11       with this case."  Well, it has everything to do with
12       this case.
13            Look at the verdict form.  One of the verdict
14       forms you will get is the verdict form for the
15       wrongful death verdict, and the same thing is true
16       for the verdict form for the survival claim.
17            And if you'll go to the verdict form itself,
18       you will note that each of the questions deals with
19       the very things we were talking about, their
20       fraudulent concealment, their defective cigarettes,
21       their agreement to conceal and omit material
22       information, their supplying defective cigarettes.
23       All of those Engle findings are the very heart of
24       this case.
25            Mr. Reilly tried to make you think that the

 1       findings have nothing to do with this case.  What
 2       did he say to you?  "The findings of some other jury
 3       don't have anything to do with this."
 4            This case is all about the findings of that
 5       jury.  You're first going to have to determine
 6       whether she was a member of the class, but as a
 7       member of the class, she is entitled to the benefit
 8       of all of these Engle findings, not only that caused
 9       the very conditions that she had, that nicotine was
10       addictive, but that they put on the market a
11       defective product that they concealed and omitted
12       material information, that they agreed to conceal
13       material information, that they supplied defective
14       cigarettes, that they were negligent.  That's the
15       whole heart of the case, and they just refused to
16       talk about it.
17            Now, those findings are on that verdict form,
18       and that's what you're going to have to decide.
19            Second observation, there's a need for some
20       fundamental fairness in looking at the questions of
21       this case.  You were given snippet after snippet of
22       testimony in which Mr. Reilly parsed the language
23       that Mrs. Warrick gave in response to depositions in
24       the last part of her life.  Here you have a
25       73-year-old frail woman, in the last months of her

 1       life, in the middle of chemotherapy and radiation,
 2       and you can see how debilitating and devastating it
 3       was, who was cross-examined for days by defense
 4       counsel.
 5            And then they come to trial when she's no
 6       longer here to defend herself and when she's not 7       here to explain what she meant, and they cut and
 8       paste little snippets of her testimony out of those
 9       endless depositions to say, "Look, she knew this;
10       look, she knew that."
11            You saw her entire deposition at length.
12       You're going to have to judge what she really said
13       in context and what she really meant and not some
14       cutting and pasting of the documents.
15            And I'm going to help you do that in a minute
16       by going through the testimony that they referenced
17       in showing you what comes before and what comes
18       after and what comes at other points in her
19       deposition that they just sort of overlooked when
20       they were talking about what she knew and when she
21       knew it.
22            Third, and finally, you are the judges of the
23       credibility of the witnesses.  You are the judges of
24       the facts.  You're going to have a massive amount of
25       evidence.  It is up to you and all the notes you

 1       have taken to reconstruct what you to believe the
 2       truth of the matter, jointly, to reconstruct that,
 3       and not rely on counsel taking a snippet here and a
 4       snippet there.
 5            Now, we think we have fairly and appropriately
 6       and adequately set out for you what the evidence is,
 7       but it's your decision.  And if you think I'm not
 8       completely stating what the evidence is, you think
 9       my recollection is incorrect, I will assure you I'm
10       not trying to misstate it, but it's your collective
11       wisdom as to what it is, not mine, not Mr. Reilly's,
12       not Mr. Engram's.
13            All right.  With those observations in mind,
14       let's talk about the first issue, class membership.
15       Now, I really couldn't believe the sort of
16       convoluted way that got discussed.
17            The class membership issue is quite simple.
18       Was she addicted to cigarettes and did that
19       addiction have -- play a role, was it a substantial
20       factor, in her continuing to smoke and get disease?
21       Any objective, unfair answer says "yes" to both of
22       those questions.
23            First, there really isn't any dispute that she
24       was addicted here.  Both the experts agree that she
25       was addicted.  Dr. Burns' description of her

 1       addiction was clear.  Dr. Frasier's description of
 2       her addiction was clear.  Even Dr. Hayes had to
 3       admit that she was addicted.  There's no question
 4       about addiction.
 5            What we saw in closing argument was Mr. Reilly
 6       converting addiction into the question of whether
 7       she could quit and converting the question of class
 8       membership in terms of whether she could quit.
 9            And he told you, quote, "She wasn't an
10       involuntary smoker.  She could quit, therefore, she
11       doesn't comply with class membership."
12            Wait a minute.  Addiction, being able to quit,
13       class membership, confusing all of the issues.
14       Everybody admitted, their experts, our expert, that
15       addiction didn't mean you couldn't quit.  It just
16       meant that you complied with those criteria that
17       meant that your brain and the receptors in your 18       brain were addicted to nicotine, it impacted your
19       behavior, it resulted in the physical symptoms of
20       withdrawal, it made it extremely difficult for you
21       to quit.  It took her nine years.  There is no
22       question that she was addicted whether or not she
23       could ultimately quit.
24            What Mr. Reilly tried to tell you was that if
25       she could quit she wasn't a member of the class.  To

 1       the contrary.  The whole point of the Engle Class
 2       Action was, first, whether you're addicted, whether
 3       or not you could quit, and, secondly, whether that
 4       addiction played some role in your getting one of
 5       these diseases.
 6            It's a matter of pretty simple logic, ladies
 7       and gentlemen.  There is no question that her
 8       addiction resulted in her continued smoking.  Took
 9       her nine years to quit.  That in itself proves that
10       her addiction resulted in her continued smoking.
11            We were told that she was probably addicted by
12       the time she was in her late 20s and early 30s back
13       in the 1950s.  And that addiction played a role in
14       her continued smoking.
15            Her continued smoking is what caused her COPD
16       and lung cancer.  No dispute about that.  You heard
17       that from them, you heard it from us.  Her continued
18       smoking is what allowed the COPD to occur.  It's
19       what allowed the cancer to develop in her lungs.
20            Seems to me, through fundamental logic, that if
21       addiction caused her to continue smoking and her
22       continued smoking caused her to have COPD and lung
23       cancer, then her addiction is a cause, not the sole
24       cause, but is a cause of her COPD and lung cancer.
25            And recall the instruction that you were

 1       pointed out would be given on causation.  The most
 2       important part of it is "It need not be the only
 3       cause."
 4            You know, you can say, Well, part of the cause
 5       is that she didn't quit sooner.  Maybe.  Talk about
 6       whether addiction played a role in that or not.  But
 7       if addiction is one of the concurrent causes and in
 8       combination with the other causes operates to cause
 9       the injury, if it's a substantial factor in the
10       injury, then it constitutes a legal cause.  That's
11       what the law is.  That's what the Judge will
12       instruct you.
13            And if you answer those two questions,
14       addiction and legal cause correctly, then she is a
15       member of the Engle Class and gets the benefit of
16       the Engle findings.
17            That's why that whole jury form asks about the
18       Engle findings.
19            Let's go, then, from class membership to
20       comparative fault.
21            Recall that we walked through the timeline of
22       her life, from the time she was born, through 1949
23       when she started smoking, all the way up to the time
24       she got lung cancer and her death.  And we talked
25       about the impact of various things on her life in

 1       connection with her smoking.
 2            You may recall the chart that Dr. Goldberg 3       offered in his testimony that did just that.  The
 4       Dr. Goldberg chart -- we'll bring it up in just a
 5       second -- starts with her smoking in 1949 of Lucky
 6       Strikes, for which R.J. Reynolds is responsible as
 7       the manufacturer, and related her smoking
 8       specifically to the kinds of advertising that would
 9       occur at that time period.
10            Her testimony, Page 151 of her deposition,
11       was the fact that it was because it was glamorous.
12       It was made to be a part of everyday life.
13       Everybody was smoking.  All of those were things
14       that Dr. Goldberg said were the result of a culture
15       of acceptance because of the massive advertising
16       and marketing that they did.  It explains her
17       starting to smoke in the first place.
18            Now, of course, it has something to do with her
19       father.  It has something to do with other family
20       members.  It has to do with her neighbors.  But do
21       we think this culture of acceptance only applied to
22       her?  The culture of acceptance was everybody.
23       That's why when she looked around, her family
24       smoked, her friends smoked, her neighbors smoked,
25       her minister smoked, her doctor smoked, her teachers

 1       smoked, her coaches smoked.  They had a smoking area
 2       for the girls and a smoking area for the boys in
 3       what was elementary school.
 4            It was a different time.  It was a different
 5       country.  It was totally accepted.  And it was
 6       accepted because of what they had done in their
 7       massive modern marketing campaign for years prior to
 8       that in which doctors attested to the benefits of
 9       smoking and athletes and celebrities, and it was
10       throughout the movies, and the ads were everywhere.
11       That's what created a culture of acceptance to begin
12       with and got her to start smoking, like over 50
13       percent of the rest of the population at the time.
14            And what happens once she started smoking?
15       You start smoking at age 13, you start smoking at
16       age 14 or 15, you become addicted.  And when you
17       become addicted, then you're a smoker for 25 years,
18       30 years, 40 years, 50 years.  And that's what they
19       knew all the way going back when they focused their
20       advertising on children.
21            And we looked at the later years of her life in
22       which we related the themes of the advertising and
23       marketing to different points of her life and how it
24       impacted her continuing to smoke.
25            '50s, theme of romance in which she talked

 1       about every magazine and what was in the magazines,
 2       and the movies, what was being said.
 3            Now, of course, she said, "Oh, I wasn't
 4       impacted by the advertising."  We all say that.  We
 5       all think we're not impacted by the advertising.
 6       But we go out and buy Tide and Cheer and all of
 7       those things that are advertised all the time,
 8       because it does impact us.
 9            It becomes the front of our mind.  It's the
10       sort of thing, as Dr. Goldberg said, "We see as we
11       go by going down the highway."  It helps us in our
12       decision making because we don't make competitive
13       decisions.  We react.  And that reaction is what 14       resulted in her continuing to smoke during those
15       time periods.
16            Later in life she switched to a Philip Morris
17       brand from a Reynolds brand because of their
18       marketing efforts as to the value of that brand and
19       the use of coupons and that you got more for your
20       money.  And at her age in life, that's exactly what
21       appealed to her to have her continue smoking.
22            And, finally, during the last portion of her
23       smoking life, she switched to Doral because of the
24       frugality, because it was cheaper, because of the
25       coupons.  And you saw her collection of those sort

 1       of things.
 2            That's what was happening during her life as a
 3       result of what they were doing.
 4            Now, what's Mr. Reilly say?  "Well, she didn't
 5       see these ads.  She didn't focus on the Frank
 6       Statement.  She didn't know what was being said by
 7       Mr. Cullman on Harry Reasoner and the CBS evening
 8       news."
 9            I suggest to you it's a little unfair to ask a
10       73-year-old woman on the verge of death from cancer
11       whether she remembers hearing something about a
12       Frank Statement in 1954 or whether she remembers
13       what they said in 1964.  None of us remember those
14       things.
15            But the impact is not that we remember the
16       specific statement or the specific ad or the
17       specific interview.  The impact is because that, as
18       Dr. Goldberg said, massive marketing campaign,
19       massive public relations campaign, massive campaign
20       of denial and deceit and concealment determines what
21       goes on around us.  It determines what we think.  It
22       determines what the people around us think and feel.
23       It, in turn, impacts on whether we think there's
24       something wrong with continuing to smoke.  It
25       impacts on the decision made on a very sort of

 1       subconscious level about smoking and continuing to
 2       smoke and whether you accept that there is any
 3       problem with it.
 4            Now, there's been a great deal of discussion
 5       about other events in her life and whether that
 6       meant she knew how harmful cigarettes might be.
 7       Let's talk about those specific items.
 8            There was some discussion about her sister Anne
 9       Marie in a real interesting sort of use of her
10       testimony that took one snippet of her testimony
11       about Anne Marie from when she knew that she was
12       told she had some lung problems because of welding
13       and smoking in the '50s and then said "that means
14       she knew that smoking was dangerous and that Anne
15       Marie's disease was a result of smoking."
16            I want to show you what else she said.  Look at
17       Page 1979 of her deposition.  Yes, that's how long
18       her deposition was.  And on that page she is asked
19       about Anne Marie and what she knew and thought.  And
20       specifically she was asked, "When she died, did you
21       relate her illness and death to her smoking?"
22            And she said, "Yes."
23            But her death was in the late '80s, not in
24       1958.  When she was asked about all those doctor 25       visits and what was being said, she went with her to

 1       the doctor in the '80s, not just in 1958.
 2            And so the question is, Was it really fair to
 3       take some snippet and suggest that she knew her
 4       illness was the result of smoking back in 1958 as
 5       opposed to when she died in 1986?
 6            Maybe the answer to that would come from when
 7       she was asked specific questions about that, as
 8       opposed to cutting and pasting.
 9            And so let's take a look at Page 2234 of her
10       deposition.  Yes, her deposition was that long.
11            And on Page --
12            MR. ENGRAM:  Your Honor --
13            MR. SHIELDS:  -- 2234 --
14            MR. ENGRAM:  Your Honor, I object.
15            THE COURT:  All right.
16            MR. REILLY:  Your Honor, can we --
17            THE COURT:  You want to approach the sidebar,
18       then?
19            MR. REILLY:  -- approach the sidebar?
20       Misrepresentation to the Court.
21            THE COURT:  All right.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
12            THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Shields.
13            MR. SHIELDS:  Thank you, Your Honor.
14            Ladies and gentlemen, I want to be clear.  I
15       was obviously mistaken.  The page number I'm
16       referring to is from the trial transcript, not that
17       her deposition was 2200 pages long.
18            You saw her deposition.  You have an idea about
19       it.  It was a deposition taken over, as you saw,
20       several days' time period with limitations as to the
21       amount that could be spent each day.
22            MR. REILLY:  Your Honor --
23            MR. SHIELDS:  Let's focus --
24            MR. REILLY:  Your Honor, can we have a further
25       sidebar?

 1            THE COURT:  All right.  Okay.
[#DELETED SIDEBAR#]
24            THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Shields.
25            MR. SHIELDS:  Yes, Your Honor.

 1            We're talking about her deposition, and I want
 2       to be clear.  Deposition was taken on different
 3       occasions.  By agreement the time was limited to
 4       four hours.  And you saw her on the video transcript
 5       for, when was it, about a day that it took to play
 6       that video transcript.
 7            What she testified to -- and, of course, it's
 8       up to you, as the jury, to recall, but we do have
 9       the transcript, and --
10            THE COURT:  So --
11            MR. SHIELDS:  -- in particular --
12            THE COURT:  Excuse me.  It was taken over a
13       number of days, is what you're saying?
14            MR. SHIELDS:  That's correct.  That's correct.
15            And we do have the transcript of what was said
16       and what you heard her say on the video transcript 17       about when she knew that cigarette smoking might be
18       hazardous.
19            She was asked, "Back when you were smoking, did
20       it occur to you that breathing cigarette smoke into
21       your lungs could be dangerous?"
22            And her response was:  "Not until the late '80s
23       and early '90s."
24            And she was asked, "What did you start hearing
25       in the late '80s and early '90s that made you think

 1       it was dangerous?"
 2            "Well, it was just that people, you know, that
 3       did smoke -- it was heavy smokers -- it seemed that
 4       they were having more and more problems, and they
 5       were having problems quitting and they were having
 6       medical problems."
 7            She provided that testimony not only at that
 8       point but in discussing the specific other family
 9       members that she was asked about by defense counsel
10       and in discussing the other people in her life that
11       had died.
12            Take another look at another page of her
13       deposition, Page 1992 and -93.
14            THE COURT:  That's of the transcript?
15            MR. SHIELDS:  Of the transcript.
16            THE COURT:  Okay.  You said of her deposition.
17            MR. SHIELDS:  That's right.
18            THE COURT:  Okay.
19            MR. SHIELDS:  When she was asked on those pages
20       and that was played to you about whether she related
21       the cancer of other family members to their smoking.
22       And she responded specifically, "Not at that time I
23       didn't.  I didn't until later."
24            And she was asked, "When did you relate her
25       cancer?"

 1            And she said, "I believe it was back in
 2       the late" -- "'80s, the late '80s, somewhere along
 3       in that time.  I'm not exactly sure."
 4            That testimony was repeated on another
 5       occasion.  If you'll take a look at Page 1984 of the
 6       transcript, which was part of the deposition that
 7       was played to you, as well.  And she was asked at
 8       that time about another family member and whether
 9       she knew at -- when she smoked what the problems
10       were, and was specifically asked, starting here, "Do
11       you know when she started smoking?"
12            When she -- and she responded by saying, "When
13       she was 13, 14 years old.  We started smoking about
14       the same time."
15            "When did she die?"
16            "It was back in the late '80s."
17            Question:  "Do you know what she died of?"
18            "Cancer," was the answer was given.
19            "Do you know what kind of cancer?"
20            And she responded, "Lung cancer and throat
21       cancer."
22            And then the question:  "Did you relate her
23       death to her smoking?"
24            Her answer was:  "Yes.  That's when I first
25       began to realize that cigarettes was dangerous."

 1            You also heard some talk in Mr. Reilly's 2       discussion about the Kitchen family and whether she
 3       related the Kitchens' family's deaths to cancer.
 4            And there was a real interesting exchange in
 5       which Mr. Reilly asserted that she had testified
 6       that she related Roy's death, which was one family
 7       member back in the '60s, to cancer.  But that wasn't
 8       the question she was asked, and that was not the
 9       answer she gave.
10            Take a look at Page 1986 of the transcript of
11       this trial.
12            And on that page she was asked about various
13       members of the Kitchen family and whether they
14       smoked and when they died.  And they died at various
15       points in time.
16            And then having established that, she was
17       asked, "Did you relate the cancer of any of the
18       Kitchen boys to their smoking?"  Not did she relate
19       the death of Roy back in the '60s, but whether she
20       related the death of any of them.  And they died
21       over a period of time.
22            So, ladies and gentlemen, what I'm suggesting
23       to you is, let's be fundamentally fair about what
24       she really said and what she knew at various points
25       in time.

 1            And if you look at the totality of her
 2       testimony and the transcript of what she testified
 3       to, then it becomes clear that what she related to
 4       as caused by cancer was in the mid to late '80s, not
 5       back in the '50s, not back in the early '60s.
 6            It's interesting, as well, that Mr. Reilly
 7       would have her saying that her sister had COPD back
 8       in the '50s.  Dr. Rubin testified to you that there
 9       wasn't even the concept of COPD in the '50s, that
10       the disease entity wasn't recognized until 1965.
11            Let's next talk about the public health
12       statements.  You were told by defense counsel that
13       they didn't give you all of the public health
14       announcement, they only gave you, quote, "a sample."
15            Is there any testimony in this case to support
16       that there were a vast number of public health
17       statements beyond the 20 or 30 documents that they
18       put in evidence?
19            They didn't put on any witness.  They didn't
20       offer any testimony as to when those statements were
21       given or how often they were given or whether they
22       were only given one time.
23            The only testimony you have is the testimony of
24       Dr. Goldberg.  And what Dr. Goldberg told you was
25       that there were limited public health statements

 1       that appeared for limited periods of time and then
 2       were drowned out by the massive amount of
 3       advertising and marketing that occurred.
 4            It was true that maybe Life magazine had a
 5       story immediately following the Surgeon General's
 6       report in 1964 that there was a controversy
 7       regarding cigarette smoking and lung cancer, but it
 8       wasn't the following month.  It was one month.
 9            And in the months that followed, as Dr.
10       Goldberg pointed out, there was ad after ad after
11       marketing item after marketing item that overwhelmed
12       any public health statement that was being made. 13            Similarly with the warning labels.  The
14       testimony is undisputed that the warning labels
15       simply were ineffective.
16            I showed you earlier today the direct quotation
17       from the Federal Trade Commission that said that
18       warning labels don't work.  They're ineffective.
19       People don't read them.  They have no impact on what
20       people think.  And their own internal testing
21       verified that.
22            They had the Roper corporation do surveys and
23       polling for them for over a period of years, and I
24       showed you what they said.  Almost two-thirds of the
25       smokers did not accept the warning, did not accept

 1       that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.
 2            And why was that?  Because of this massive
 3       public relations campaign of denial that you have
 4       seen.
 5            We also heard some discussion about Dr. Sapp
 6       and whether or not he told Eveline Warrick back when
 7       he saw her that she had COPD.  Once again, the
 8       evidence is a little bit different than Mr. Reilly
 9       provided.
10            If we took a look at Page 2300 of the
11       transcript, we have the actual testimony on that.
12       And the actual testimony regarding Dr. Sapp and
13       Dr. Barnhart is not that she had chronic obstructive
14       pulmonary disease or severe breathing problems, as
15       Mr. Reilly said, but that she had a cough.
16            And she saw Dr. Sapp as a result of having a
17       cough, and she subsequently talked with Dr. Sapp
18       about her cough and a subsequent doctor,
19       Dr. Barnhart.  And she was specifically asked what
20       they told her.  And they told her that her cough was
21       caused by cigarettes.
22            Lots of smokers have coughs as a result of
23       cigarettes.  That's not COPD.  That's not chronic
24       obstructive pulmonary disease.  That's a smoker's
25       cough.  Different entity entirely.

 1            And she was specifically asked what they told
 2       her.  She responded that they didn't say much about
 3       it because they smoked.  Dr. Sapp smoked.
 4       Dr. Barnhart smoked.  They didn't tell her to quit
 5       smoking.  They certainly didn't say, "You've got
 6       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease so that you
 7       need to quit smoking," as Mr. Reilly implied in his
 8       argument.
 9            There was also some discussion by Mr. Reilly of
10       the statute of limitations issue and specifically
11       when she knew that she had chronic obstructive
12       pulmonary disease.
13            And so I want to remind you of the testimony
14       from Dr. Bagnoli regarding that issue.  He was
15       clear.  Dr. Bagnoli said, first, that Eveline
16       Warrick was one of the most honest people that he
17       had ever met and that there was no indication that
18       she had any idea that she had chronic obstructive
19       pulmonary disease until he diagnosed it and told her
20       in 1991.
21            In fact, she came to see him thinking that she
22       had a bug bite.  And that was the problem that she
23       was coming to him about.  Because in the past she 24       thought that a bug bite had resulted in the same
25       sort of symptoms.

 1            Instead he, for the first time, diagnosed that
 2       she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in
 3       1991, not prior to May of 1990.  And as a result,
 4       there is simply no basis for their assertion that
 5       the statute of limitations has run.
 6            You know, there was a discussion about when she
 7       quit smoking.  I think I had said that she quit
 8       smoking in late 2000, early 2001.  I don't know what
 9       difference it makes in terms of this case, whether
10       it was Thanksgiving of 2000 or in early 2001.  There
11       are records that go both ways.  The fact of the
12       matter is that she did quit smoking, that she quit
13       smoking after years of trying to quit, and that she
14       was quite proud at the end of her life of the fact
15       that she had been able to quit smoking.
16            It is also undisputed that she went through
17       withdrawal symptoms throughout that nine-year period
18       of time.  Mr. Reilly argued that, "Well, she didn't
19       have any withdrawal symptoms when she finally quit."
20       Well, that wasn't the testimony of Calvin.
21            Calvin, as you recall, testified that she did
22       have symptoms, that she was irritable and nervous
23       and unable to sleep.  Norma testified as well that
24       she had symptoms at that point in time.
25            Regardless of how severe they were, I don't

 1       think there's any denial that over the time period
 2       in which she tried to quit and when she ultimately
 3       was able to quit that she had withdrawal symptoms.
 4            Let's turn from those issues on the timeline to
 5       what this case, then, really is about.  And that is
 6       whether their misconduct is one of the causes of her
 7       disease.  You will see that on the verdict form.
 8       That's what the case is about, despite the fact that
 9       they don't want to talk about it and they don't want
10       to talk about their misconduct.  They just want to
11       describe it as a few bad ideas, as really not
12       corporate policy.  That is not what the documents
13       show.
14            Now, of course, we only put in 20, 30, 40, 50
15       documents.  Dr. Proctor explained to you that there
16       were millions of pages of documents.  I don't think
17       you really wanted us to bring millions of pages of
18       documents for you to review in your deliberations.
19       But what he did say to you was, "These are just
20       illustrative.  They're examples of what they were
21       doing during that time period."
22            There is no evidence in this case to deny what
23       they did.  They made statement after statement
24       denying that cigarettes caused cancer.  They made
25       statement after statement saying that if they ever

 1       found anything harmful in cigarettes they would take
 2       it out.  And why did they do that?  To keep people
 3       smoking.
 4            They issued White Papers and sent them out to
 5       every doctor in the country.  They created bogus
 6       health magazines and sent them out to everybody to
 7       suggest that it was safe.
 8            To suggest that's a few bad ideas and really 9       unimportant is to totally disregard the magnitude of
10       the evidence and the fact that after a year's trial
11       the Engle jury concluded that they concealed
12       information, that they made a defective product,
13       that they entered into a conspiracy, that they
14       breached the warranties, that they were negligent.
15       You are bound by those findings when you determine
16       that she was a member of the Engle Class.
17            But Mr. Reilly argues that that doesn't prove
18       legal cause.  You may recall his discussion in which
19       he said, "Well, those really aren't the cause of her
20       having lung cancer, what is the cause is the failure
21       to quit."
22            And we have said from the beginning of this
23       case that we accept some responsibility for her
24       actions and they refuse to accept any
25       responsibility.  And you saw that throughout his

 1       discussion and Mr. Engram's discussion.
 2            But in thinking about legal cause, think about
 3       this, as well.  One of the principal findings is
 4       fraudulent concealment, that they concealed
 5       information from her and other members of the
 6       public.
 7            But then he turns around and says, "It had no
 8       impact because she didn't see the information."
 9       Well, I thought that was the whole point of
10       concealment.  If you fraudulently conceal something,
11       of course you don't see it.  That's the whole point.
12            The fact that you concealed the information
13       from the public, including Eveline Warrick, is the
14       basis for the claim.  And the question becomes, Had
15       they disclosed all the information they knew, had
16       they disclosed it back when they knew it, what
17       changes would have been made?  What would have
18       happened?
19            And the answer, I think, is pretty clear.  What
20       we see today would have been occurring back in the
21       '50s and '60s, not to years later.
22            What we see today would have impacted on
23       whether people continued to smoke like Eveline
24       Warrick.  It would have impacted on their quit
25       attempts.  And had that occurred back in the '50s,

 1       early '60s when they knew it and the culture began
 2       to change at that point, even if it would have taken
 3       her a decade to quit smoking, as it ultimately did,
 4       the time period when she would have quit would have
 5       been in the late '60s and early '70s, not in 2000.
 6            And all the evidence here is that had she been
 7       able to quit back then, she wouldn't have got COPD.
 8       She wouldn't have got lung cancer.
 9            That's why it's the legal cause, because the
10       concealment of that information changed the entire
11       culture of this country.  It put us 50 years behind
12       where we would have been had they been open and
13       honest, told the truth and shared the information
14       that they knew internally.
15            Now, Mr. Engram talked a great deal about the
16       cause of her death.  And I'm not going to spend a
17       great deal of time talking about that.  I've already
18       told you our position on it, and that is that the
19       position their experts take is inherently 20       inconsistent and that if you really want to know the
21       cause of her death, look to what the treating
22       physician said.  He said it was the result of her
23       smoking and COPD.  And look to what Emanuel Rubin
24       said.
25            But as we have made absolutely clear, we, in

 1       fact, probably are better off if you say it wasn't
 2       the cause of her death because the survival claim,
 3       the claim that she would have even if it wasn't the
 4       cause of her death, may be more valuable from a
 5       legal standpoint than would a wrongful death claim.
 6            So I'm not going to waste your time by arguing
 7       with Mr. Engram about every detail of her heart and
 8       whether an enlarged heart caused it or whether it
 9       was a cardiac arrhythmia or whether it was
10       ventricular fibrillation.
11            Ladies and gentlemen, you make the decision of
12       what you think it was.  We think the truth of the
13       matter is that it caused her death.  But if you
14       conclude to the contrary, that's fine with us.
15       Because the claim may be more valuable as a survival
16       claim.
17            You should exercise a little common sense about
18       this, however.  And your common sense will make
19       clear that all of this had to have an impact on
20       causing her death.
21            You may recall the question I asked Dr. Shuman
22       at the -- the pathologist at the end of his
23       examination.  That may have gone past some of you.
24       I -- out where I grew up, out west, maybe it made a
25       little more sense.  But, you know, the question was,

 1       If you're in west Texas and off the horizon you hear
 2       hoofbeats, you don't go looking for zebras.
 3            Well, what does that mean?  That means you use
 4       your common sense to look for what really is likely.
 5       And in west Texas what's likely is that they're
 6       horses, not zebras.  And in medicine you look for
 7       what is the likely cause, not for some farfetched
 8       cause.
 9            And that's why the attending physicians, that's
10       why Dr. Rubin says, "There's nothing on this autopsy
11       that says she died from an enlarged heart."  So the
12       most obvious, the common-sense answer is that she
13       died from her cancer and the treatment of her
14       cancer.
15            Finally, let me talk about the totality of the
16       evidence and the question we started with.  I agree
17       with Mr. Reilly that the question here includes
18       control and responsibility as well as causation, but
19       it's not just her.  They had control over what they
20       told the American people.  They had control over
21       what they committed to tell people.  They had
22       control of their own executives when they went on
23       the evening news and denied that cigarettes caused
24       smoking and said clear up into the '90s, not just
25       back in the '50s, that cigarettes weren't addictive,

 1       that cigarettes did not cause cancer, that if they
 2       ever found anything bad in cigarettes they would
 3       take it out.
 4            It went that entire time period, not like 5       Mr. Engram implied just way back during the '50s.
 6       That conspiracy continued right up through the Engle
 7       trial itself in 1999.
 8            So here we are, 2010, and on behalf of the
 9       Estate we say we accept that she had some
10       responsibility, but it is time that they accept some
11       responsibility, as well.
12            We are 57 years after Mr. Teague analyzed the
13       evidence and said, "The clinical evidence indicates
14       that cigarettes cause lung cancer."
15            We are 46 years after the Surgeon General's
16       Report.
17            We are 22 years after the Surgeon General's
18       report that cigarettes are addictive.
19            We are 16 years after they stood up in Congress
20       and swore under oath that cigarettes were not
21       addictive and did not cause lung cancer.
22            And we are 11 years after the original Engle
23       jury in this class action found that they engaged in
24       a fraudulent conspiracy, that they fraudulently
25       concealed information, that their product was

 1       defective and unreasonably dangerous, that they
 2       breached their warranties and that they were
 3       negligent.
 4            It's time that they be made to accept some
 5       responsibility, as well.  And we're going to leave
 6       it in your hands for you to force them to accept
 7       some responsibility by your verdict in this case.
 8            We urge you to return a verdict that she's a
 9       member of the Engle Class, she's entitled to the
10       benefit of the Engle findings, that there is no bar
11       by the statute of limitations, that her diseases and
12       illnesses are the result of their misconduct and
13       allocate between her fault and their fault an
14       appropriate division and finally, and perhaps most
15       importantly, to return a verdict that the Estate is
16       entitled to punitive damages as a result of their
17       decades-long conspiracy and campaign of deceit and
18       denial.
19            Thank you again for all of your attention.  We
20       appreciate it.  Your work begins tomorrow.
21            Thank you.
