 7            MR. REILLY:  Judge, that suggests that my
 8       closing argument might make somebody sleepy.  And I
 9       hope that's not true.
10            And when I practiced this last night, I
11       practiced it by saying, "Good morning, everybody,"
12       and I'm still making it.
13            THE JURY:  Good morning.
14            MR. REILLY:  So good morning, everybody.
15            THE JURY:  Good morning.
16            MR. REILLY:  You know what, I want to start my
17       closing argument in kind of the same way that
18       Mr. Shields did, and that's by thanking you for your
19       service.
20            When we started this, when we were picking you
21       guys as jurors, we said things like tremendous
22       responsibility, tremendous power.  Remember all
23       that?  And when we were talking about it, I said,
24       you know, we're going to ask you to leave your jobs
25       and your homes and your families and come spend a

 1       lot of time with us.  And you've done it.  And I
 2       said, "Your job is going to be to listen closely to
 3       all the evidence in this case," right?  And then you
 4       were going to have to put that together with the law
 5       that Judge Boyer is going to give you here in just a
 6       little bit.  Actually, it's probably going to be
 7       Monday, I think.
 8            And, you know, for this system to work right --
 9       I asked all you guys, "Is there any better system in
10       the world?"  You know, we talked about raising
11       hands, and is anybody not from here in the United
12       States and do they have a system -- a better system
13       anywhere else in the world?  And we all agreed that
14       this was the best system.
15            And for it to work really well, you guys got to
16       do what you did in this case.  And what is that?
17       You paid very close attention to the evidence as it
18       was coming in.
19            And sometimes that wasn't all that easy.  And
20       I know that because some of it was long depositions
21       on that screen, including one where I was
22       cross-examining Dr. Farone.  And I'll be perfectly
23       honest with you.  I got a little sleepy, myself,
24       listening to me cross-examine.
25            So I know it was hard sometimes.  But you guys

 1       did a great job.  And we really, all of us, on
 2       behalf of myself, Mr. Bradford, everybody in this
 3       room, we appreciate the work you've done.
 4            But, of course, your work isn't over yet,
 5       right?  Now we've come to the most important part.
 6       This is where you actually resolve this civil  7       dispute.  This is where you take the evidence that
 8       you heard from the witness stand and the documents
 9       and things that are going to be sent back with you
10       into the jury room, and the instructions that Judge
11       Boyer is going to give you, and you put it all
12       together, you answer the questions on the verdict
13       form, and you resolve this dispute, right?  All
14       right.
15            So now let's get started.  You know, at the
16       very beginning of this case, when I gave you my
17       opening statement, I put this board up.  And you
18       notice that we're going to see an awful lot of the
19       boards that I put up, because I told you that what I
20       wanted you to do was to watch the evidence and see
21       whether or not it didn't turn out to be exactly what
22       I told you it was going to be.  That's what I told
23       you.
24            And I said, "You know what, this case is going
25       to be about three words."  I said, "We can distill

 1       this whole case down into three words."  And what
 2       were they?  Control, who was in control of
 3       Mrs. Warrick decisions, lifestyle choices, that came
 4       with the potential for long-term health
 5       consequences?  And I said, "For sure that's going to
 6       include smoking," right?  But I said, "That's not
 7       the" -- in order to know about why somebody does
 8       what they do, you have to look a little broader than
 9       that, right?  You have to know more about the person
10       than just their smoking.  You have to know how they
11       live their life, right?
12            So I said, "We're going to be looking at" --
13       "we're going to have a little window into how
14       Ms. Warrick lived her life, and it's going to
15       include things like smoking, diet, health, weight,
16       all that kind of stuff."
17            And you did, you got a little window into who
18       was in control of Mrs. Warrick's lifestyle
19       decisions, including her decision to begin smoking,
20       continue smoking, quit smoking.
21            I said this case was going to be about
22       causation.  I said, "You're going to be asked what
23       was the cause of her death."  And Mr. Shields just
24       referred to this as a "false issue."  It's not
25       really a false issue.  It's an issue in this case.

 1       And you guys have to resolve it for us.
 2            And what's the question?  The question is:  Did
 3       she die because of her lung cancer or chronic
 4       obstructive pulmonary disease, or did she die
 5       because she had a terribly diseased heart, a heart
 6       twice as large as its normal size, with electrical
 7       problems?  Did her heart stop beating because it had
 8       electrical problems, too large a size, and it beat
 9       for the last time because of that?
10            And I should start this by saying, Mr. Engram
11       and I are going to divide up the defense side of the
12       closing argument, and he's going to talk to you
13       about that.
14            And then I said, "Once you know the answer to
15       who was in control of Mrs. Warrick's decisions and
16       what was the cause of her death, then you would be
17       able to determine who was responsible in this case." 18       Who was responsible?
19            And I said, "You know what, you won't see these
20       words on the verdict form; you won't see these words
21       in the instructions.  This is a distillation."  And
22       that's true, you won't see them on the verdict form.
23       But that is what this case turned out to be about.
24            As you watched the evidence in this case,
25       that's what you saw unfold, when we talked about

 1       whose case this was.
 2            This is not a class action.  This is not a case
 3       about America, in general, or American people or the
 4       American population or people who answer surveys.
 5       This is a case about one smoker, right?  And who is
 6       that?  That's Eveline Warrick.  That's whose case
 7       we're here about today.
 8            All right.  So, now, what does -- what are the
 9       questions that we asked you to answer?  And I have
10       the verdict form.  It looks like this.  And you're
11       each -- I don't know if everybody gets a verdict
12       form, but everybody gets a set of instructions.
13            But the first two questions that you're going
14       to be asked to answer -- can everybody see this?
15            THE JURY:  (Nods head.)
16            MR. REILLY:  Okay.  "Was Eveline Warrick
17       addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?  Yes or
18       no?"  And, number two, "If your answer to question 1
19       was yes, then you need to answer the second
20       question, which is, 'Was Eveline Warrick's addiction
21       to cigarettes containing nicotine a legal cause of
22       her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?'"
23            Okay.  Now, what did the evidence turn out to
24       be regarding whether or not Mrs. Warrick was
25       addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?  Well,

 1       you guys had two addiction experts come here.  The
 2       plaintiffs brought Dr. Frazier, and we brought
 3       Dr. Hayes, right?  Dr. Hayes was the lady that
 4       appeared last in this trial.
 5            And Dr. Frazier said, "Yes, Mrs. Warrick was
 6       addicted."  And here in this courtroom on direct
 7       examination, she said, "In my opinion, my clinical
 8       judgment, Mrs. Warrick was addicted from the time
 9       she was in her -- either her late teens or her early
10       20s, sometime in the late '50s or early '60s."  And
11       she said, "I use as my guide a manual here, the DSM,
12       but" she said, "I don't have enough information to
13       use this going all the way back to the '50s or the
14       '60s."
15            So here in this courtroom, on direct
16       examination, she said, "So I used my clinical
17       judgment to make that determination."  But then on
18       cross-examination I reminded --
19            What's the best way to do this?  Let's use two
20       of these.
21            Can you see this one, too?
22            A JUROR:  Yeah, except for the bottom.
23            MR. REILLY:  Except for the bottom?
24            A JUROR:  (Nods head.)
25            MR. REILLY:  How about that?

 1            A JUROR:  (Shakes head.)
 2            MR. REILLY:  Still in the way.  Okay.  You know  3       what?  I'll do it another way.
 4            There you go.  Sorry.
 5            And if anybody can't hear me -- because the
 6       court reporter told me before I got started, she
 7       said, "Speak up, Mr. Reilly.  You're too
 8       soft-spoken," so...
 9            On cross-examination I reminded her that in her
10       deposition she had testified that she said, "I can
11       tell you, based on my clinical experience and based
12       on the fact that she started so young and if she was
13       smoking a pack a day, I would not be surprised if
14       she met the criteria for nicotine dependence in her
15       late teens or early 20s.  Nobody could tell you
16       within medical certainty unless they were there at
17       that time and interviewed her to see if she met the
18       criteria, so I cannot say with medical certainty.  I
19       can say it wouldn't surprise me at all, based on my
20       clinical experience of treating patients for lots of
21       years with nicotine dependence."
22            So then she was asked, "So it wouldn't surprise
23       you, but you really don't know?"
24            "No, I don't.  Nobody would."
25            That's what she was reminded of.

 1            Now, what did Dr. Hayes say?  Dr. Hayes said,
 2       "I also am using this same criteria, the same
 3       criteria found in this manual."  And she said, "You
 4       know what, just as Dr. Frazier had said in her
 5       deposition" -- she said, "you know what, there's
 6       just not enough information before 1991 to make that
 7       determination.  But I will tell you this, if her
 8       smoking -- if her quitting history that she
 9       described after 1991 is accurate, then I'll say that
10       she meets the necessary three criteria for
11       determining that somebody is nicotine-dependent as
12       of 1991."  But she said, "There are reasons to be
13       uncertain about that.  There are reasons for
14       questioning."
15            And, you know, she is a forensic psychologist,
16       Ph.D. in forensic psychology.  And she told you what
17       that means is that she's trained in looking at folks
18       who say things for reasons.  Like the person who
19       claims insanity because he or she wants to avoid the
20       death penalty, right?
21            So now Dr. Hayes said, "Look, I'm not saying
22       that -- I'm not" -- she didn't -- she didn't accuse
23       Mrs. Warrick of not telling the truth.  She only
24       said, "There are certain things in the medical
25       records that raise some question."

 1            For example, she said, "Look, was there any
 2       indication on Mrs. Warrick's part about having quit
 3       smoking in 1993 when she was diagnosed with that
 4       lesion on her epiglottis?"  Do you remember that?
 5       And how, when the doctors told her --
 6            And this is that medical record that talks
 7       about here "She was a one-and-a-half-pack-a-day
 8       smoker."  "Off," in other words, she quit smoking in
 9       December of 1993.
10            January '94, that's when they have this
11       epiglottis.  And remember Dr. Bagnoli said, "That
12       lesion went away over some period of time because
13       she stopped smoking."  Now, he couldn't be specific 14       as to how long, but he said, "You know, this is not
15       something that happens overnight."
16            And then -- remember Mrs. Warrick testified
17       that she couldn't -- she couldn't stop smoking
18       between 1991 and Thanksgiving 2000 except for a
19       couple days at a time, or maybe two or three weeks,
20       maximum, one time?  But here was her podiatrist
21       record, and it was filled out by Mrs. Warrick on
22       July 7th, 1994.  And the question was asked, "Do you
23       smoke?"  And her answer was "No."
24            Now, Mrs. Warrick didn't say anything about
25       this in her deposition.  She didn't say anything

 1       about the epiglottis situation in her deposition.
 2            Now, do we know whether or not Mrs. Warrick
 3       stopped smoking between December of '93 and July
 4       of '94?  Is that why she said she was a -- she wrote
 5       no to being a smoker?  We don't know.  Did she stop
 6       smoking for longer than July 7th, 1994?  We don't
 7       know.  We don't know.
 8            But that's why Dr. Hayes raised this issue
 9       about whether or not she truly was addicted from
10       1991 on.  Because if she really could stop and if
11       she really did stop, that would be inconsistent with
12       the history that she gave, right?  And now we have
13       these medical records that raise that question.
14            I have an echo.
15            All right.  But, you know, I leave that -- the
16       answer to that first question, "Was she addicted to
17       cigarettes containing nicotine," to your sound
18       discretion.  You guys heard the evidence.  You guys
19       decide.  You will decide, regardless of whether I
20       tell you to.
21            But there's a second question here.  And
22       Mr. Shields really didn't focus on a significant
23       part of this question.  Part of your instructions,
24       part of your obligation, part of what you are
25       obliged as jurors to do -- you can't skip over it.

 1       You know, it's like if you're building an airstrip
 2       or you're doing a maintenance project or you're
 3       teaching folks about how to do something or you're
 4       filling out the paperwork for reimbursements or
 5       determining the validity of claims, you got to do
 6       all the steps.  You can't leave any of them out.
 7       Even though some of them are harder than others,
 8       even though some are doggone hard, you still got to
 9       do every step, every step.
10            So what you have to determine is whether or not
11       if Mrs. Warrick was addicted, whether or not her
12       addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine was a
13       legal cause of her chronic obstructive pulmonary
14       disease.
15            Now, have you seen yet the definition of legal
16       cause?  Well, Mr. Shields didn't explain it to you
17       at all, but here it is.  Let's read through it
18       because it's hard.  It's filled with legalese.
19            "Addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine is
20       a legal cause of COPD if it directly and in natural
21       and continuous sequence produces or contributes
22       substantially to producing such COPD so that it can
23       reasonably be said that, but for the addiction, the
24       COPD would not have occurred."  Would not have 25       occurred.

 1            Now, I'll tell you.  I said it slowly because
 2       it's hard, and I know that law students spend three
 3       years in law school trying to learn what that means.
 4       And then lawyers like me spend the rest of our lives
 5       trying to figure out how to communicate it to
 6       people, because it's hard.  It's a hard concept.
 7            But what it boils down to is that -- and this
 8       is their burden of proof.  This is their burden of
 9       proof.  They have to prove to you that if she was
10       addicted, her addiction was so strong, so powerful
11       that without it, that but for it, she would never
12       have gotten her COPD.  Without it she would never
13       have gotten her COPD.  That's how powerful it has to
14       be.  That's their burden of proof.  They have to
15       bring a bigger mountain of evidence on this point
16       than we do.  That's their obligation.
17            Now, what Mr. Shields showed you and walked
18       through was the second half of this.  And it
19       basically says that addiction doesn't have to be the
20       only cause.  It can work in conjunction with some
21       other cause.  But that doesn't alleviate, that
22       doesn't eliminate their obligation to prove that the
23       addiction was, in the first place, a legal cause,
24       the "but for" cause, of why she got her COPD.
25            Now, I realize -- I realize this is not easy.

 1       It's just like I said.  It's a step you have to --
 2       you can't skip over it.  You can't skip over it.
 3       It's part of what you have to wrestle with and
 4       determine.
 5            Now, to help you -- to help you with that issue
 6       there's something we need to focus on -- and
 7       Mr. Shields talked about it -- and that is their
 8       admission.  What's their admission?  What did they
 9       admit in this case?  And you're going to see it in
10       your instructions.  What did they admit in this
11       case?
12            Norma Warrick, as the representative of
13       the estate of her mother, admitted that Eveline
14       Warrick's acts and omissions relating to the
15       duration and frequency of her efforts to quit
16       smoking were a partial cause of her COPD.
17            In other words, they've said, "Look, her
18       efforts at quitting were a legal cause of her
19       getting COPD."
20            Now, why did they admit that?  They had to
21       admit that.  Mrs. Warrick, as Mr. Shields just told
22       you in his closing argument, never even -- never --
23       never tried to quit until 1991.  When did
24       Dr. Bagnoli diagnose her with COPD?  1991, same day,
25       same day.

 1            So if you -- I mean, it says, "The duration and
 2       frequency of her efforts."  There were none.  There
 3       were no efforts -- there was no duration, there was
 4       no frequency, there were no efforts to quit before
 5       1991.
 6            All right.  So what does this mean?  What does
 7       that admission mean?  Now, they said it.  And I
 8       don't want to overlook it.  When they made that
 9       admission, they tacked on that they think that 10       Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are responsible,
11       too, right?  That's the way they worded their
12       admission.  But they admitted that Mrs. Warrick was
13       in control -- this is what this means.
14            What that means is that they have admitted that
15       Mrs. Warrick could have quit smoking in time to
16       avoid her COPD and her lung cancer, and her lung
17       cancer.  It means that Eveline Warrick's decisions
18       were a direct, substantial contributing factor to
19       her COPD and her lung cancer.
20            That's this actual test for determining
21       whether something is a legal cause.  That's what
22       they admitted, and you'll see it in the
23       instructions; you'll see it in the instructions.
24            All right.  Why did they have to acknowledge
25       this?  It's because you now know -- you had a window

 1       into the life of Mrs. Warrick.  If you go back to
 2       that question of control, who was in control of
 3       Mrs. Warrick's decisions about beginning smoking,
 4       continuing to smoke?
 5            And another way of looking at that is, every
 6       day when Mrs. Warrick woke up and looked in the
 7       mirror, was there somebody else looking back that
 8       was responsible for what she did that day?  Was
 9       there somebody else who was looking back saying,
10       "No, today you will or won't start smoking; today
11       you will or won't decide to quit; today you will or
12       won't decide to not smoke anymore?"
13            Is Mrs. Warrick different than anybody else?
14       Was there somebody else in the mirror, really and
15       truly?
16            Remember when I put this timeline up -- and
17       it's the very same timeline, very same timeline, no
18       changes -- and I said, "You know what, we're going
19       to walk through Mrs. Warrick's life."  And I'm just
20       going to take you right back through it, because --
21       well, I'm not going to make all the stops I did
22       before.  I don't have -- I'm not going to take that
23       much of your time.
24            But I didn't change anything on this timeline.
25       And Mr. Shields said I didn't -- I didn't develop

 1       the evidence that represents many of the stops on
 2       this timeline.  But you know what?  I'm going to
 3       show you the evidence in each and every one of the
 4       stops that relates to Mrs. Warrick, each and every
 5       one.  Because I've been doing this a very long time,
 6       and I'm not going to put something on a timeline
 7       that I create that I can't support.  I'm never going
 8       to do that, never.
 9            Mr. Shields said I misrepresented the evidence
10       in this case.  I'm never going to do that, never.
11            I explained to you in my opening statement that
12       the evidence would show that Mrs. Warrick was born
13       into a family where the dad -- I didn't say he was a
14       tobacco farmer.  I said he grew his own tobacco, and
15       he did.  That's exactly what the evidence showed.
16       He grew his own tobacco for his personal use.  He
17       gave it to his father-in-law.  He grew it so that he
18       could make cigars, cigarettes, snuff, chewing
19       tobacco.  That's what I told you, and he did, and
20       she testified to it. 21            I said he grew it, he harvested it, he cured
22       it, he flavored it, he cut it up, and he turned it
23       into cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco and snuff.
24       And that's what the evidence showed.
25            Now, who did he enlist to assist him in that

 1       task?  Eveline Warrick.  You remember what I said --
 2       and I don't have the testimony -- I didn't bring
 3       this testimony because I didn't know he was going
 4       to -- Mr. Shields was going to say what he said --
 5       but you remember I said that the evidence would show
 6       that the one thing she wanted out of his estate when
 7       he died was that knife that he used to make those
 8       cigars and cigarettes to cut up the tobacco.
 9            And you remember in her deposition she said --
10       and I got it -- "That's the one thing I wanted and I
11       got it."
12            Was that important to her?  Mr. Shields said
13       that she didn't smoke his cigarettes.  Well, in
14       fact, that's not true.
15            This is on?  Thanks.
16            Here's the testimony.  Now, let me tell you why
17       you see this on printed form like this.  It's
18       because -- although you see a videotape, whenever
19       there's a video being made, a videotaped deposition,
20       they also have a court reporter there, and she takes
21       everything down and they turn it into a booklet just
22       like this.  And so that's why you see this.
23            And this is the actual transcript -- this is
24       the work of -- you've seen this team of court
25       reporters coming in and out.  They actually make

 1       daily copy of what goes on in this courtroom.  So
 2       this is the actual trial transcript.
 3            So this is Mrs. Warrick testifying on the
 4       video --
 5            Whoops.  Did I just do something bad?  I did.
 6       I pushed that button.
 7            Thank you.  Saved my life.
 8            So this is the actual testimony.
 9            "I didn't start smoking until I was 13.  I did
10       try some of Daddy's cigarettes."
11            I did try some of Daddy's cigarettes.
12            "When was that?"
13            "I was about 14 years old, I guess, 12, 13 or
14       14 after I started smoking."
15            "How did you get ahold of some of his
16       cigarettes?"
17            "I just wanted to try one of them and he gave
18       it to me."
19            "Okay.  What did you think of it?"
20            "It was a lot better than Lucky Strikes."
21            "So you thought his tobacco was pretty good?"
22            "Huh?"
23            "His tobacco was pretty good, you thought?"
24            "Yeah, I can remember it, the difference in the
25       taste."

 1            "Okay.  And this was just a roll-your-own
 2       cigarette" --
 3            "Uh-huh."
 4            -- "made with his tobacco?"
 5            "Uh-huh."  6            "And what was different about the taste?"
 7            "It was just -- it wasn't as strong, and it had
 8       more of a flavor taste to it or something."
 9            "By flavor taste, what do you mean, a
10       particular flavor or" --
11            "Well, not like a vanilla flavor or anything
12       like that.  It just had a -- kind of a sweetish
13       taste to it a lot.  I can remember it."
14            You know, this is when she was 13 years old.
15       How many years later -- this is 2009.  She can still
16       remember the flavor of his cigarette.
17            "Okay.  Did you frequently smoke the cigarettes
18       made from his tobacco" --
19            "No."
20            -- "or was it just one time?"
21            "Just tried them a couple of times maybe."
22            So, sure, she tried her dad's cigarettes.
23            I would leave that down, except it blinds me.
24            All right.  Who else smoked in that family?
25       Well, you know that her dad smoked.  You know that

 1       her mom didn't.  You know that her grandfather did,
 2       because sometimes he would get some of her dad's
 3       cigars.  You know that her older sister, Annie
 4       Marie, smoked.  You know that because you've heard
 5       that testimony in this case.
 6            Now, why did Mrs. Warrick begin smoking?  Well,
 7       I'm not going to tell you that she didn't say that
 8       she thought it was glamorous.  She said -- you can
 9       see a passage in her deposition where she says she
10       thought it was glamorous, advertising, everyone was
11       doing it, everyone was doing it.  And, yes, her dad
12       smoked; her older sister smoked, the sister she was
13       really close to; her friend Nancy smoked.  Lots of
14       people smoked, no question about it.
15            You remember, though, I asked Dr. Goldberg -- I
16       put up that chart that had four things on it.  It
17       was parents, peers, siblings and environment.  And I
18       asked Dr. Goldberg -- remember, Dr. Goldberg was the
19       guy -- the old professor who went to that seminar,
20       seminar -- went to that conference of plaintiffs'
21       lawyers on how to win big verdicts in tobacco cases,
22       how to find jurors in mock trials who would be
23       favorable to the plaintiffs' side of the case; you
24       remember that?  He's the guy that I -- they asked
25       him, "How much money have you been paid?"  And he

 1       said "600,000."  And then I said, "Well, wait a
 2       minute.  Five years ago you said you've been paid
 3       700,000.  Did you give some money back?"
 4            And he said, "No, I didn't give any money
 5       back."
 6            And then I said, "Well, you calculated that you
 7       made another $50,000 a year over the last five
 8       years, so that would be about a million bucks you
 9       made?"
10            Well, I asked him, "In all of the 20 or 25
11       cases that you've looked at, have you ever seen a
12       fact scenario like that?"  A factual scenario where
13       you had a -- where you had a family that was that
14       into making their own tobacco company, making their
15       own tobacco products -- "factual background like
16       that?"  And he said, "No, I haven't, no." 17            So what were the influences that caused
18       Ms. Warrick to begin smoking?  I think it's
19       awfully clear in her case -- and this is all
20       about Mrs. Warrick.  This is not about the
21       American public.  This is not about some -- this
22       is not a class action.  This is just about
23       Mrs. Warrick, right?  You know that.
24            All right.  So that's starting smoking.
25            Advertising.  Did Mrs. Warrick talk about

 1       advertising?  Yeah, she said a lot about
 2       advertising.
 3            I'll do it one at a time.
 4            And this is what she said.  And, look, just so
 5       you know that it really did come in a trial
 6       transcript, for every entry that I've shown you,
 7       I've put at the bottom the exact page and line
 8       numbers on the transcript, just like I showed this.
 9       Every page is numbered and the lines are numbered.
10       So you know that what I'm showing you is right out
11       of the trial transcript.
12            So Mrs. Warrick was asked about advertising.
13       Mr. Shields said we didn't ask her enough questions.
14       Didn't ask enough detail.  But I'll show you.  We
15       asked -- I'll show you that Mr. Shields didn't show
16       you what we did ask.
17            "When did you and your husband have this
18       conversation about the Marlboro Man?"
19            "Oh, we used to laugh, talk about it when it
20       would come on TV all the time."
21            "Okay.  So that was when it was on television?"
22            "Uh-huh."
23            "And what about it made you laugh?"
24            "It was such a stupid commercial to me."
25            That's what she thought about advertising.

 1       Let's see some more.  Let's see some more.
 2       Mrs. Warrick said a lot of stuff.
 3            "Did you ever talk about cigarette
 4       advertisements to anyone other than your husband?"
 5            "Oh, yeah, I've talked about it, but who and
 6       when I can't remember.  Another one I always thought
 7       was stupid, the Virginia Slims."
 8            "Virginia Slim?"
 9            "That one to me is a disgrace to women."
10            Was she being positively influenced by
11       advertising?  Let's see some more.
12            "Were there any other cigarette advertisements
13       that you thought" -- misspelled, sorry -- "were
14       stupid?"
15            "I'm sure there were a lot of them, but I just
16       don't remember them because, well, they had no
17       reason for me to remember them."
18            And then here sort of sums it all up.
19            "Anything else, any specific ad?"
20            "Not really a specific ad."
21            "Okay."
22            "I really don't pay that much attention to
23       ads."
24            And is that really any different than anybody
25       else, really?  If you went out on the street and

 1       interviewed people, do you think they would say,  2       "You know what?  Cigarette ads are why I started
 3       smoking.  Cigarette ads are why I kept on smoking,"
 4       really and truly?
 5            Let's go to the '50s.
 6            Yes, Wynder and Graham.  Their first witness,
 7       their first live witness, Dr. Proctor, said, "With
 8       Wynder and Graham's study looking at groups of
 9       people, smokers and nonsmokers, who got lung cancer
10       more often?"
11            And he said, "That's when science -- even
12       though people had been trying to engage in science
13       before they got -- they got conflicting results --
14       but as of 1950 using what they call 'epidemiology,'
15       the science started to take hold connecting smoking
16       with lung cancer."
17            1950, 1953, science is starting to grow, no
18       doubt about it.  Was it a secret from the American
19       public?  You remember I showed you Life magazine --
20       I showed you-all those magazines.  You're going to
21       have them.  You're going to have them.  This was no
22       secret from the American public, no secret at all.
23            And you'll have the mag- -- I mean, was Life
24       magazine a secret?  Reader's Digest a secret?  Come
25       on.

 1            Now, Mr. Shields talked about the Frank
 2       Statement, and, yes, there's no doubt that the Frank
 3       Statement was published.
 4            Now, that's why we have to talk about legal
 5       cause for just another minute.  Because I told you
 6       at the beginning of this trial that during the
 7       course of this trial you would see things that the
 8       cigarette manufacturers -- ideas that people had,
 9       statement peoples made -- statement people --
10       statements people made, and recommendations people
11       had that today I wouldn't do and you wouldn't do, no
12       doubt about it.
13            I said they clung too long to the idea that
14       smoking hadn't been proven to cause lung cancer or
15       other diseases.  They clung too long to the ideas
16       that smoking wasn't addictive.  No debate about it.
17       But this isn't a class action.  This isn't about the
18       American public.  This is about one person.  And
19       what the plaintiffs have the burden of proving in
20       this case is that something that Philip Morris or
21       R.J. Reynolds did actually was a legal cause of
22       injury to Mrs. Warrick, actual legal cause of injury
23       to Mrs. Warrick.
24            Legal cause -- this is the way I think -- this
25       is a little diagram that I've created that I think

 1       is helpful in terms of thinking of legal cause.  And
 2       what is that?  Whatever it is, whatever it is,
 3       whether it's a newspaper ad or an interview on
 4       television or something like that, there has to be
 5       a direct connection between whatever it is and
 6       Ms. Warrick such that it had a substantial impact
 7       and then it can be a legal cause.
 8            So as we go through this, I'm just going to be
 9       asking you guys to consider, is that something that
10       had a direct connection with Mrs. Warrick that
11       resulted in having a substantial impact so that it
12       was a legal cause of why she either began smoking, 13       continued to smoke or didn't quit smoking until
14       1990 -- or didn't begin to quit smoking until 1991
15       or didn't quit smoking until 2000 at Thanksgiving.
16            All right.  So let's use as our first example
17       this Frank Statement.  Where was it published?  Did
18       anybody come here and say it was published in
19       anything that -- any newspaper that Mrs. Warrick was
20       ever even close to?  Was -- Mrs. Warrick was asked
21       specifically, "Have you ever heard of something
22       called A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers?
23            "A what?"
24            "A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers."
25            "That, I'm not familiar with."

 1            Did that have a direct connection, a
 2       substantial impact, was it a legal cause of anything
 3       for Mrs. Warrick?  Well, you know the Frank
 4       Statement didn't cause her to start smoking, because
 5       the Frank Statement didn't get published until
 6       January of 1954.  She's been smoking for five years,
 7       right?  So it sure as heck didn't cause her to
 8       start.
 9            Did it cause her to continue to smoke?  Was
10       there any evidence of that?  Well, there can't be
11       because she didn't know anything about it and,
12       frankly, there's no evidence that it was ever
13       published in a paper that she could have ever seen.
14            Well, how about -- Mr. Shields had spent a lot
15       of time, I think the majority of his closing
16       argument -- talking about things that Philip Morris
17       or R.J. Reynolds thought internally, wrote an
18       internal memo about, or something like that.
19            So Mrs. Warrick was asked point-blank,
20       point-blank -- Mr. Shields said she didn't get asked
21       enough direct questions.  She was asked point-blank,
22       "Have you ever heard a cigarette company make a
23       statement about smoking and health?"
24            "Not the cigarette companies."
25            There's the page and line.

 1            "Well, how about the Council for Tobacco
 2       Research" -- I'm sorry -- "How about the Tobacco
 3       Industry Research Committee?  Do you know if you
 4       ever heard any statement made by the Tobacco
 5       Industry Research Committee?"
 6            "No."
 7            "No, you didn't?"
 8            "No, I didn't.  I don't remember hearing
 9       anything that they did."
10            "Well, how about the Council for Tobacco
11       Research or The Tobacco Institute, organizations
12       with connection to Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds?
13       Have you ever heard any statement made by the
14       Council for Tobacco Research?"
15            "No, not that I know of."
16            "Do you know if you've ever heard a statement
17       made by The Tobacco Institute?"
18            "Of the what?"
19            "The Tobacco Institute."
20            "I don't think so."
21            So, again, is there a direct connection that
22       has a substantial -- that had a substantial impact
23       that resulted in a legal cause of injury to 24       Mrs. Warrick?  And how could it be?  It would have
25       to be something that caused her -- since it didn't

 1       cause her to start smoking, it would have to be
 2       something that she heard or saw or read that caused
 3       her to continue to smoke.
 4            All right.  Now, let's go back to the timeline.
 5       And let's go to the late '50s.
 6            I'm going to put this right over here.
 7            Mr. Shields brought up this "Annie Marie
 8       situation" in the late '50s.  And he said that I had
 9       misrepresented what the testimony was about Annie
10       Marie's situation.  And I'm going to show you right
11       now I didn't misrepresent a thing.
12            Here's the exact testimony.
13            "Do you know when she was diagnosed with COPD?"
14            This is Annie Marie's COPD.
15            "Probably back in the late '50s."
16            "How did you find out about her being diagnosed
17       with COPD?"
18            "Talking to her" -- "talking to her and going
19       with her to and from the hospitals and the doctors'
20       offices."
21            And he said we didn't ask enough details; we
22       didn't find out when.
23            "So did you take her to the doctor then?"
24            "The late '50s, many times."
25            Many times.  But she was asked more detail than

 1       that.
 2            Mr. Shields said, you didn't ask whether or not
 3       the doctor said it was caused by her smoking.
 4       Mr. Shields said you didn't ask -- here's more of
 5       the transcript testimony.
 6            "When she was diagnosed, did you-all talk with
 7       the doctors about what was causing the COPD?"
 8            "Yes."
 9            "What did they say?"
10            "They said it was her heavy smoking, and she
11       was a welder during the war in the shipyards.  They
12       were constantly on her to quit smoking."
13            This is -- I appreciate that they would like
14       to not have this testimony on the record, but it's
15       there.  There's the transcript right there.  This is
16       the late '50s.  This is their own client.
17            Now, they want to have a whole bunch of excuses
18       for why this testimony occurs.  But that's her
19       testimony.  That's her testimony.
20            "What was causing the COPD?"
21            "Yes."
22            "What did they say?"
23            "Heavy smoking, and they were constantly on her
24       to quit smoking."
25            Now, Mr. Shields suggested, well, this can't be

 1       right because she said the doctors used the phrase
 2       "COPD" and that didn't get coined or used until mid
 3       '60s.
 4            Well, I've got two suggestions for you in that
 5       regard.  The first is, I asked Dr. Proctor, their
 6       science historian, a Ph.D. in the history of
 7       science -- I asked him point-blank, "There were
 8       doctors who were telling their patients in the '50s  9       'I'm diagnosing you with any of those diseases, it's
10       all one and the same, chronic obstructive lung
11       disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
12       that's COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and
13       telling them it's caused by your smoking,' right,
14       and that's in the '50s?"
15            And he said, "I'm sure some were, yes."
16            "And you would agree with me that if you were
17       being told by your physician that that's the
18       diagnosis and in the physician's opinion that's why
19       you have it, that would be a powerful source of
20       information letting you know about the health risks
21       of smoking, wouldn't it?"
22            And Dr. -- their expert said, "I would hope it
23       would be powerful."
24            Of course it would be powerful.  Imagine
25       sitting with -- a sister sitting with the sister

 1       she's particularly close to, the sister she loves,
 2       and listening to the doctors diagnose her with COPD.
 3       What are the symptoms of COPD?  Chronic cough,
 4       shortness of breath.  Who said so?  Their expert,
 5       Dr. Burns, their expert.
 6            Chronic bronchitis, you remember Dr. --
 7       Dr. Proctor just got through telling you that
 8       they're all interchangeable, chronic bronchitis,
 9       emphysema, COPD, COLD.  It's all the same, it's all
10       the same.
11            "Chronic bronchitis is usually used either to
12       refer to just a chronic cough or to be a synonym for
13       chronic obstructive lung disease."
14            This is all coming from their witnesses, their
15       client, their experts.
16            So as of the late '50s -- and we sure got
17       plenty of detail -- as of the late '50s, what does
18       Mrs. Warrick know?  She knows -- she sat there with
19       her sister many times in the hospitals and the
20       doctors' offices listening to the doctors look right
21       at her sister and say, "You have COPD."
22            Now, maybe she used the term "COPD" because
23       she's going to watch her sister over the next 25
24       years with this illness.
25            You remember Dr. Andrews, the guy from Tampa,

 1       he came here and told you, "This is a long-standing
 2       disease.  This is a disease that you have for
 3       decades."  And he said, "The symptoms are chronic
 4       cough, shortness of breath."  And he told you,
 5       "Look, doctors diagnose that, especially family
 6       practitioners, internists, they diagnose you with
 7       COPD all day long based on chronic cough and
 8       shortness of breath."
 9            Well, here she is in the late '50s, her
10       sister's got COPD, and the doctors have told you,
11       "It's due to your smoking."  Is that a powerful
12       piece of information for Mrs. Warrick?  Does she
13       decide that at that moment that she's going to make
14       any effort to quit smoking?  Is she going to give up
15       the pleasure that she derives from smoking?
16            Look, this is -- we're here because a lawsuit's
17       been brought.  I'm telling you this story.  I'm
18       telling you about this why?  Because we're in
19       litigation. 20            Is this a criticism of Mrs. Warrick?
21       Absolutely not.  This is America.  You get to make
22       up your mind here whether or not you're going to
23       smoke or not.  You get to decide for yourself.  You
24       get to look in the mirror every morning, and you get
25       to say I'm going to drink beer.  I'm going to drink

 1       Scotch.  I'm going to smoke cigarettes.  I'm going
 2       to smoke cigars.  I'm going to smoke a pipe.  I'm
 3       going to eat McDonald's.  I'm going to -- I'm going
 4       to live my life.  That's what we get to say here in
 5       America.  We fought for that right.
 6            All right.  Let's go to the '60s.
 7            Throughout the '60s Mrs. Warrick is going to
 8       be with her sister, right?  Doesn't go away.  Her
 9       sister lives in this town.  Ms. Warrick lives in
10       this town.  She's going to watch her from the late
11       '50s all the way through to her death in 1985.
12            Yes, Mrs. Warrick said I didn't know about the
13       health -- another point in her deposition.  She
14       said, "I don't know about the health" -- "I didn't
15       know about the health risks of smoking until the
16       late '80s."
17            People say things that just don't make any
18       sense sometimes.  How can that be possible, right,
19       with this history?
20            And you remember in my opening statement I
21       talked about the "Roy Kitchen" story.  And I said,
22       You know what?  It's not perfectly clear, not
23       perfectly clear, that Mrs. Warrick connected Roy
24       Kitchen's death from cancer with his smoking; pretty
25       clear, but I said in my opening statement, not

 1       perfectly clear.  And here's the testimony.  I
 2       didn't pull any punch on that.
 3            "Okay" -- this is Mrs. Warrick.  This is the
 4       page and line.
 5            "Okay.  Do you know what Roy died of?"
 6            "Cancer."
 7            "Okay.  And when did he die?"
 8            "Back around '64 or '65."
 9            "Okay.  Did you relate the cancer of any of the
10       Kitchen boys to their smoking?"
11            "Yes."
12            Now, that's not crystal clear, but pretty
13       close.
14            Now let's see in just a minute just exactly how
15       crystal clear we are about another Kitchen.
16            1964, the Surgeon General's Report -- you know,
17       Mrs. Warrick -- you're going to see the coverage.
18       You saw the coverage.  And, frankly, I'm going to
19       show you Harry Reasoner right now, because you'll
20       remember this was what was on all three channels
21       back in the day, CBS, ABC and NBC, and this is what
22       the broadcasters were telling you about the Surgeon
23       General's Report.
24            Can we play that, Shreve (phonetic)?  Thanks.
25            (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

 1   court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:)
 2            ANNOUNCER:  "This is a CBS news extra on
 3       smoking and health, the findings of the Surgeon
 4       General's Committee."  5            HARRY REASONER:  "Almost from the moment that
 6       cigarettes were introduced they were attacked.  But
 7       the attacks took a new turn ten years ago and
 8       culminated in today's report by the Surgeon
 9       General's Committee.
10            "This, in summary, is what the Committee says.
11       Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in
12       men, and data on women smokers points the same way.
13       Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of cancer
14       of the larynx and probably the most important cause
15       of chronic bronchitis.  Cigarette smoking may be
16       related to other lung diseases.
17            "Male smokers have a much higher death rate
18       from heart disease, although it's not proven that
19       smoking is the cause.
20            "On the question of filters, the Committee says
21       there is no evidence that they do any good, but it
22       didn't exclude the possibility that an effective
23       filter might be developed.
24            "In short, the Committee said, 'If you smoke
25       cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying

 1       early.  The sooner you start, the more you smoke,
 2       the more you inhale, the worse your chances are.'
 3            "In this kind of a country, it comes down to
 4       you, whether you like it or not.  No one is going to
 5       forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear
 6       that no one is going to tell him it's good for him
 7       either.
 8            "The decision is his, the decision and the
 9       health that may depend on it.
10            "This is Harry Reasoner.  Goodnight."
11            (The video clip was ended.)
12            MR. REILLY:  I can't tell you whether or not
13       Mrs. Warrick saw that broadcast.  I know that their
14       addiction expert, Dr. Frazier, wishes what Harry
15       said was not true.  Remember one of the first things
16       I asked her on cross-examination is, "You're a
17       person who wishes that Americans didn't have the
18       choice to smoke, aren't you?"  She said, "Yes, I
19       wish Americans did not have the choice to smoke."
20       That's all right.  You're welcome to your opinion,
21       but, as Harry said, "In this country we do have that
22       choice."
23            She also said she's never met somebody -- she's
24       never had a patient come to her who said, you know
25       what, I enjoy smoking and I don't want to stop.  She

 1       said she's never had anybody say that.
 2            1966, the first warning labels go on the
 3       package of cigarettes.  "Caution:  Cigarette Smoking
 4       May Be Hazardous to Your Health."
 5            We asked Mrs. Warrick in detail about that
 6       warning and other warnings, in detail.
 7            "What did you think when the warning labels
 8       first went on the packs?"
 9            "I really didn't think anything."
10            "Okay.  Did it surprise you?"
11            I'm going to sneeze -- don't take it down.
12       Maybe I'll talk myself out of it.
13            "Did it surprise you?"
14            "Not really.  I just didn't pay any attention
15       to it, I guess." 16            "Did that warning tell you anything you didn't
17       already know?"
18            Did it tell you anything you didn't already
19       know?
20            "I don't think so."
21            How do you square that with "I didn't know
22       about the health risks of smoking until the
23       late '80s?"
24            "Were you not concerned that there was a
25       warning on the cigarettes that you were smoking?"

 1            "I just didn't really pay any attention to it,
 2       I guess."
 3            "Okay.  Well, why not?"
 4            "Probably busy with something else."
 5            "That's okay.  You don't have to pay attention
 6       to them if you don't want to."
 7            "Would you not have paid attention to warning
 8       labels on cigarettes because you loved your
 9       cigarettes?"
10            "Probably."
11            Did Mrs. Warrick enjoy smoking?  You bet she
12       did.  She enjoyed smoking for a variety of reasons.
13       "Because you loved your cigarettes?"  "Probably."
14            What did she enjoy about cigarettes?  I didn't
15       take out each and every line item, but these are
16       generally the reasons why she said; she said she
17       enjoyed the taste, especially the cigarettes
18       manufactured by Philip Morris, the Saratogas,
19       socialization, relaxation, boredom, and the pleasure
20       you get from smoking, and the pleasure you get from
21       smoking.
22            All right.  Let's go back to this timeline.
23            Thelma Kitchen, late '60s, early '70s.  She
24       said -- I won't tell you what I said.  I'll just
25       read it to you.

 1            Mr. Shields said she didn't know -- she wasn't
 2       connecting her friends' death from cancer to their
 3       smoking until the late '80s.  This is exactly what
 4       she said about Thelma Kitchen's death.  And
 5       Mr. Shields, in his closing argument, didn't even
 6       mention Thelma Kitchen, didn't even bring her up.
 7       He only talked about the Kitchen boys, remember?
 8            "Okay.  What did Thelma die of?"
 9            "She had cancer."
10            "What kind of cancer; do you know?"
11            "It was lung cancer and throat cancer."
12            "Do you remember the decade?  Was it the '60s
13       or '70s?"
14            "I think it was the late '60s or early '70s,
15       somewhere in there."
16            "Okay.  Did you relate her smoking to her
17       cancer?"
18            "Thelma, I did, uh-huh."
19            Now, does that lack clarity?  Did she say, "No,
20       not until the '80s, the late '80s," or did she say,
21       "Thelma, I did, uh-huh"?  Did I misrepresent this to
22       you in some way?
23            Did Mrs. Warrick -- at any point in this time,
24       did Mrs. Warrick give any indication she had any
25       interest in quitting smoking?  Did she say, "I want
4613  1       to quit smoking.  I want to give up the pleasure I'm
 2       getting from smoking.  I want to try to quit.  I'm
 3       going to" -- no, not once.  Mr. Shields said it,
 4       and he was right, in his closing argument, that
 5       Mrs. Warrick did not make any effort to quit smoking
 6       until 1991.  And that's okay.  We get to make those
 7       decisions.  But now we're in a lawsuit.
 8            The '70s, 1970, the pack warning changes.
 9       You've already seen what Mrs. Warrick said about
10       warnings.  I think Mr. Block, when cross-examining
11       Dr. Hayes, said, "Well -- but she smoked," what did
12       she say, a half a million cigarettes?  That means
13       she had a half a million opportunities to look and
14       see whatever the warning was at the moment, right?
15       At least 300,000 opportunities since the warnings
16       went on the packs in '66, right?
17            I put on this timeline Eveline tells Gail,
18       "Smoking is dangerous."  You know where that came
19       from was the testimony of Dr. Hayes yesterday.
20       Dr. Hayes was given all the depositions in this
21       case.
22            Now, we didn't read -- we didn't read all the
23       depositions that were obtained in this case.  But an
24       expert gets to review them all, gets to review them
25       all.  And so that's where she got this statement.

 1       "Eveline told her daughter Gail, 'Smoking is
 2       dangerous.'"  And that's what Dr. Hayes told you
 3       from the stand, in 1971.
 4            Now, 1971, Joe Cullman.  And Mr. Shields just
 5       played it for you.  And, like I said, Philip Morris
 6       clung too long to the notion that smoking hadn't
 7       been proven to cause illness.  No doubt about it.
 8            Did Mrs. Warrick watch Face the Nation and see
 9       Joe Cullman?  You already saw her statement, "I
10       never heard a thing the tobacco industry ever said
11       about smoking and health, not once."
12            So, once again -- I won't put it up -- once
13       again, has Mr. Shields satisfied the obligation of
14       that hard thing you've got to look at, and that is,
15       did he prove that there's a legal cause connection
16       between Philip Morris's statement by Joe Cullman and
17       Mrs. Warrick continuing to smoke?  You already know
18       the answer to that.
19            Or Jim Bowling, do you remember -- do you
20       remember on that interview, the interviewer has a
21       British accent.  Why is that?  Because that was for
22       a program shown in England.  Is there any evidence
23       in this case that Mrs. Warrick ever went to England?
24       None.  Was there any evidence that she ever saw Jim
25       Bowling, James Bowling?

 1            Mr. Shields said, well -- but we didn't bring
 2       you any of these people.  These people are dead.
 3       They were old adults in the '70s, right?  That's 40
 4       years ago.
 5            1975, Ms. Warrick -- now, is that exactly when
 6       they switched to Saratogas?  Nobody really knows
 7       because we don't really -- she wasn't really clear.
 8       She actually thought she switched to Saratogas in,
 9       like, '70, '71, which wasn't possible, because, as
10       you learned from Dr. Goldberg, Saratogas weren't
11       made until 1970 for the very first time. 12            Okay.  So I put it on the board at the very
13       first opportunity, 1975.  I didn't -- I didn't
14       quibble about that.  1975.  I accept it.  And how
15       long did she smoke Saratogas?  They don't really
16       know.  But I'll give her ten years, ten years of
17       smoking out of 50 years of smoking history.  I said
18       '85 [sic], fine.  Why quibble about it?
19            Why did she switch to Saratogas?  Because of
20       advertising?  No.  She actually gave two reasons.  I
21       have one on the board.  I'll tell you about both.
22       They were talking about -- in this part of the -- of
23       the deposition, they were talking about her husband
24       switching to Pall Malls.  And so the question was:
25       "Probably the same sort of thing when he started

 1       Pall Malls, they were just out of your brand that
 2       day?"  This is talking about how she switched to
 3       Saratogas.
 4            "Uh-huh."
 5            "And you got a new brand and decided it was all
 6       right?"
 7            "I know that's how I started on Saratogas."
 8            I know that's how I started on Saratogas.
 9            "They're out of my brand at the store so I pick
10       another, (inaudible) Saratogas, and I liked them."
11            "Did you like the taste of the Saratoga better
12       than the taste of the Viceroy?
13            "Yeah."
14            So did she continue to smoke Saratogas?  Yes.
15       Did Mr. Warrick say, "We like Saratogas.  We liked
16       them best"?  Yeah.  Okay.  So that's why they
17       switched.
18            Now, the '70s.  Mr. Shields said that I was
19       terribly overstating Mrs. Warrick's situation in the
20       '70s in connection with her cough.  He said, "All
21       she had was a cough."  And he said that I said that
22       the doctors told her to quit.  I never said that.
23            I told you in my opening statement that her
24       doctors told her, Dr. Sapp in particular, said,
25       "Your cough and your breathing problems are due

 1       to your smoking."  And now I'm going to show you
 2       that testimony.  And this is from their client,
 3       Mrs. Warrick.
 4            "When did the cough get worse?"
 5            "Actually, back in the '70s it got" -- what did
 6       she say?  She didn't say I have a little cough.  She
 7       said, "It got pretty bad."
 8            "And you were seeing Dr. Sapp at that time; is
 9       that correct?"
10            "Uh-huh."
11            "And was he telling you then that the cough was
12       related to the smoking?"
13            "Yes.  He had the same problem."
14            Mr. Shields said we didn't ask enough
15       questions.  We asked some more questions.  I wasn't
16       there.  I didn't ask the question, but were more
17       questions asked?  You bet.
18            "Did you tell him you were having breathing
19       problems?"
20            "He knew it, yeah.  We discussed it."
21            So here we are, her cough got bad, she's having
22       breathing problems, Dr. Sapp knows it. 23            "Did he tell you that the breathing problems
24       were related to the smoking?"
25            There's the page and line.

 1            "Yes, many times."
 2            Now, you know, she stopped seeing Dr. Sapp in
 3       the '70s, early '80s, something like that.  Now, do
 4       we have his medical records?  No, we don't have his
 5       medical records.  He's been dead.  His records are
 6       gone.  But this is their own Eveline Warrick's
 7       testimony.  For this to be wrong, she's got to be
 8       inaccurate.  They have to run away from her
 9       testimony.  They have to say, "No, no, don't believe
10       her.  Believe her when she says something we like,
11       but don't believe her when she says something we
12       don't.  She's inaccurate.  She's sick.  She's not
13       able to recall things correctly, right"?
14            "Yes, many times."
15            "Many times.  And that was back in the '70s?"
16            "Yeah."
17            Did I make this up?  There's the page and line
18       of the transcript.
19            Breathing problems, bad cough.  What are the
20       symptoms of COPD?  What symptoms has her sister had
21       now since the late '50s?  What diagnosis has she sat
22       there and listened to the doctors give to her
23       sister?  And she's sitting right there.  Right
24       there.  Right there.
25            Yes, it relates to the third question on the

 1       verdict form.  And what is that third question?
 2       "Did Eveline Warrick know or by the use of
 3       reasonable care should she have known, before May
 4       5th" -- this is in the '70s.  Her sister's diagnosis
 5       is in the late '50s.  She's at Dr. Sapp's office.
 6       She follows with Dr. Barnhart.  This is in -- that's
 7       in the '70s.  That's 20 years before May 5th,
 8       1990 -- "that she had chronic obstructive pulmonary
 9       disease and that it was reasonably caused by the
10       defendants' actions?"  What's that?  Making
11       cigarettes.
12            Well, you know, this issue was addressed by
13       both Dr. Bagnoli and Dr. Andrews.  They asked
14       Dr. Bagnoli, "Dr. Bagnoli, did she know she had COPD
15       before 1991?  Should she have known that she had
16       COPD before 1991?"  And Dr. Bagnoli said, "No."  But
17       then on cross-examination, Dr. Bagnoli was asked,
18       "Did you have Mrs. Warrick's deposition?"
19            And he said, "No."
20            He was asked, "Do you know about her being
21       cared for by Dr. Sapp or Dr. Barnhart?"
22            "No."
23            "Do you know about her breathing problems?  Do
24       you know about her chronic cough in the '70s?"
25            "No."

 1            "Do you know about her sister Annie Marie and
 2       her COPD diagnosis in the late '50s and her disease
 3       and her death in 1985?"
 4            Dr. Bagnoli sees Mrs. Warrick for the first
 5       time in 1991.  Annie Marie has been dead now for six
 6       years.  Did Dr. Bagnoli know anything about Annie
 7       Marie?  Not a thing.  He was asked, and he said, "I  8       don't know."
 9            We gave Dr. Andrews -- you remember the
10       pulmonologist that came from Tampa that runs the --
11       that works at the VA, runs their -- what do they
12       call it, the -- I forget exactly the clinic that he
13       runs, but it's the tumor clinic, basically, where
14       they can't -- it's really hard to figure out -- all
15       the doctors are sending in their difficult cases to
16       see whether or not these people have lung cancer or
17       not.
18            And we asked Dr. Andrews -- who we gave the
19       deposition of Mrs. Warrick to, so he knew that she
20       saw Dr. Sapp in the '70s and that she had seen
21       Dr. Barnhart.  He knew about her -- her description
22       of her chronic cough, her description of her
23       breathing problems.  He knew about Annie Marie's
24       diagnosis in the '50s, and he knew about Annie
25       Marie's death.

 1            And so I asked him these three questions.
 2            "Let me ask you this, is there anything that
 3       would have prevented Mrs. Warrick from being
 4       diagnosed with COPD in the late '70s?"
 5            "No."
 6            And you remember Dr. Andrews explained to you
 7       that COPD is a long-running disease, that you go
 8       from mild to moderate to severe.  When she sees
 9       Dr. Bagnoli in 1991, what does he diagnose her as?
10       Severe.  So that means that she's had this disease
11       for decades, right?  That's exactly what Dr. Andrews
12       told you, no dispute in this case.  No dispute.
13            So does she have COPD when she sees Dr. Sapp
14       and Dr. Barnhart in the '70s and '80s?  Sure, she
15       does.  Dr. Andrews told you she does, and it's not
16       disputed by anybody, nobody.
17            So then the question was posed to Dr. Andrews:
18       "Is there any reason why she wouldn't have been able
19       to reasonably determine that she had COPD in the
20       late '70s?"
21            "No."
22            "Is there any reason why she couldn't have
23       asked Dr. Sapp or Dr. Barnhart, 'What's the nature
24       of my reason -- of my illness'"?
25            Just asked, "What's the nature of my illness?"

 1            You see, this question doesn't just say, "Did
 2       you know."  It says, "Could you reasonably have
 3       determined?"  "Could you reasonably have
 4       determined?"
 5            "By the use of reasonable care, should she have
 6       known before May 5th?"  That's the '70s and the
 7       '80s.
 8            Those answers by Dr. Andrews are not disputed
 9       by anybody that actually knew the history that
10       Mrs. Warrick provided, not disputed by anybody that
11       knew the history.
12            You can keep your expert in the dark if you
13       want and then ask him the question and he'll answer
14       you based on the information he has.  That's why I
15       think it's important to give the expert all the
16       information.  Give him the history.
17            All right.  That's the '70s.  Let's go to the
18       '80s. 19            You're being very patient with me.
20            '80s.  1985, Annie Marie dies of COPD and lung
21       cancer.  Mrs. Warrick's testimony that they're
22       relying on that she doesn't know about the health
23       risks of smoking that say that she doesn't know
24       until the late '80s, her sister dies in 1985.  The
25       warnings on the packs now say explicitly "Smoking

 1       causes lung cancer."
 2            And just to show you -- you know, they
 3       suggested that Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds should
 4       have put a list of the carcinogens in cigarette
 5       smoke on the packs maybe or in an ad in the
 6       newspaper.
 7            After all of this, after all of this, can you
 8       reasonably say that Mrs. Warrick would have changed
 9       how she operated her life one bit if Philip Morris
10       had put a list of the carcinogens on a pack of
11       cigarettes?
12            You don't leave your common sense at the door
13       to this courtroom or the security checkpoint.  You
14       bring it right on into the jury box.  You bring it
15       right on into the jury deliberation room.
16            Maybe even more dramatic, 1988, Calvin has a
17       heart attack.  Mrs. Warrick -- they say it's due to
18       his smoking.  Mrs. Warrick testifies -- "What
19       specifically did you tell your husband after his
20       heart attack about quitting smoking?"
21            "I said, we both needed to quit."
22            "Did you" --
23            "But even I didn't try until 1991."
24            So here she is talking about Calvin doesn't
25       try.  And she says "Even I didn't try until 1991,"

 1       three years later.
 2            Now, she sat there and watched her husband have
 3       a heart attack.  Do you really think for a minute
 4       that if Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds had put
 5       something on a pack of cigarettes about carcinogens
 6       in cigarette smoke that she would have done
 7       something different than she did, really and truly?
 8            All right.  I've already shown you the --
 9       there's no dispute that Mrs. Warrick didn't try to
10       quit until 1991.  Mr. Shields started his closing
11       argument off by telling you that.
12            Okay.  I've already shown you the medical
13       records regarding 1993.  Mr. Shields showed you the
14       tobacco industry's CEOs testifying before Congress,
15       as was shown on C-SPAN in 1994.  Is there any
16       indication in this case that Mrs. Warrick ever saw
17       those guys on C-SPAN?  No.
18            Did I tell you in my opening statement that I
19       thought they clung too long to the idea that smoking
20       wasn't addictive?  You bet I did.  But did it have
21       an impact in this case, in Mrs. Warrick case?
22       Because they have to prove that it was a legal cause
23       of injury to Mrs. Warrick.
24            Direct connection, substantial impact, legal
25       cause.

 1            Thanksgiving Day she quit smoking.  No dispute
 2       as to how that happened.
 3            "And, I don't know, there was just something  4       about that dog that was telling me, 'You got to
 5       quit.'  And I was sitting there smoking a cigarette.
 6       I put it out, and I never put another one in my
 7       mouth.'"
 8            Now, remember I asked both addiction experts,
 9       but especially Dr. Hayes, "That "quit" on
10       Thanksgiving, does that raise a question as to
11       whether or not somebody's addicted to have those
12       brain changes when the nicotine is going to be gone
13       over the next," what did she say, "half-life of a
14       day and a half, two days?"
15            So when are the -- "If you're going to have
16       withdrawal symptoms because you have an
17       up-regulation or an increased number of
18       neuroreceptors and they're all crying out for
19       nicotine, when are you going to have withdrawal
20       symptoms?"
21            "You're going to have them in the first week or
22       two weeks," she said.
23            Did Mrs. Warrick have any of that?  She wasn't
24       on nicotine replacement.  She had no medication, but
25       she had no withdrawal symptoms, no irritability to

 1       lack of concentration, no craving, no difficulty.
 2       No difficulty.  No difficulty.
 3            All right.  That takes us back to the first
 4       question on the verdict form "Was she addicted" and
 5       leave that to your discretion.  "Was addiction, if
 6       she was addicted, the legal cause of her developing
 7       her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?"  I
 8       believe the answer to this one is no.
 9            On that question about whether she
10       reasonably -- with reasonable care should have known
11       before May 5th, 1990, that she had COPD, because we
12       know she had it, the answer to this one is yes.
13            All right.  And if that's the way you answered
14       those questions, that ends your responsibilities in
15       this case.  That's the way this verdict form is set
16       up.
17            Actually, it says -- Shreve (phonetic), can we
18       do this?  Is it this one?
19            VIDEO TECH OPERATOR:  You just have to uncover
20       it.
21            MR. REILLY:  Thanks.
22            "Only if you answer both the first two
23       questions yes and you question" -- "and you answer
24       question 3 no do you go on to question 4."
25            Only if you answer the first two questions yes

 1       and if you answer the third question no do you go on
 2       to question 4; otherwise, your work here is done.
 3            If you go on to question 4, then you have to
 4       answer the question, "Was Eveline Warrick's lung
 5       cancer a legal cause of her death?"  And that is a
 6       question that Mr. Engram is going to talk to you
 7       about when I sit down.
 8            All right.  And that's the first verdict form
 9       that you're going to have.  Depending upon how you
10       answer that, you may have no verdict forms after
11       this.  Your work would be done.
12            Sorry.  Next page.  You have to answer Question
13       Number 5.  If you answer those questions, you have
14       to answer both was her -- "Was lung cancer the legal 15       cause of her death or was COPD the legal cause of
16       her death?"  So you have to answer both of those if
17       you answer questions 1 and 2 yes and question 3 no.
18            All right.  Now, there's a second verdict form.
19       If you -- and I don't think you go beyond that.  I
20       think the evidence in this case has shown you don't
21       go any farther than that and your work is done.
22            But there is another verdict form, and I
23       probably should go through it with you, so I will.
24       And I won't spend nearly as long going through this
25       as I did through the other one -- or through that

 1       evidence.  You've been very considerate.
 2            Now, let me remind you that the decisions by
 3       that jury in Miami ten years ago have nothing to do
 4       with answering a single question on this first
 5       verdict form, nothing.  This is all you guys.  These
 6       findings don't even apply -- they don't have any
 7       impact whatsoever unless you have to go to the
 8       second verdict form.
 9            And I don't know -- the two verdict forms are
10       virtually identical, if you go on, whether it's a
11       survival action or wrongful death action.  So I've
12       just picked one.  And I'm just going to run through
13       these questions.  And, yes, if you get here, those
14       jury findings from the jury in Miami ten years ago
15       would be binding on you, but you still have to
16       determine whether or not any of those activities --
17            Do you have a marker?
18            -- any of those findings were a legal cause of
19       Mrs. Warrick's -- this is the wrongful death action
20       verdict form.  You have to decide whether any of
21       those activities were a legal cause.  And that's
22       true all the way through.
23            For each one of those theories, you have to
24       make the determination of legal cause.  You have to
25       make the determination of whether or not those

 1       things had a direct connection, a substantial
 2       impact, and were a legal cause.
 3            And as an example of that -- oh, for example,
 4       number 2, "State whether the defendants" -- "State
 5       for each defendant whether the fraudulent
 6       concealment was a legal cause of Eveline Warrick's
 7       death."
 8            You have to ask yourself, did the plaintiffs
 9       prove in this case that anything that Philip Morris
10       or R.J. Reynolds failed to say about the health
11       risks of smoking actually caused Mrs. Warrick to
12       die.
13            If you answer those questions in that way, then
14       you get down to Question Number 7.  Matter of fact,
15       you're going to have to answer, I think, about ten
16       or 11 more questions.  But you'd get down ultimately
17       to Question Number 7 at one point.  And you'd have
18       to apportion responsibility between Mrs. Warrick,
19       Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and there you'd be
20       having to determine whether someone has acknowledged
21       that they had the power, the ability, but didn't
22       exercise it to quit, and quit in time to avoid
23       getting any illness whatsoever.
24            Does somebody else really have a percentage of
25       responsibility in why they got sick and why they 4630
 1       died?  Was there really somebody else looking in the
 2       mirror or when they had the power, when they had the
 3       ability to stop smoking, stop in time to avoid
 4       getting their illness altogether?
 5            And that brings us to -- the only thing I'll
 6       say about damages -- I really don't talk about
 7       damages.  The only thing I'll say about damages is,
 8       we stipulated to the dollar amount of the -- of the
 9       medical bills and funeral expenses, because we don't
10       dispute things that shouldn't be disputed, shouldn't
11       be disputed.
12            Now, as far as Mr. Spruance was concerned, the
13       only thing I'll say about that is that all 235- or
14       -45,000 dollars, the Warricks didn't pay a penny of
15       that.  They never shelled out any money for somebody
16       to come spend the night with the Warricks.  They
17       never spent any money to have somebody come and cook
18       a meal or clean their house.  Those were all things
19       that Mr. Spruance thinks that they should have
20       gotten, should have had available to them.  And so
21       that's how he made his calculation.  That's how he
22       made his calculation.
23            Okay.  Then we come to the final question, and
24       that is -- number 11, and that is, "Under the
25       circumstances of this case, please state whether" --

 1       sorry -- "by clear and convincing evidence punitive
 2       damages are warranted against each defendant."
 3            And I will tell you once again, in the
 4       instructions you're going to see that this is not
 5       something in the air.  This is not in general.  This
 6       is not a class-action question.  This is about
 7       Mrs. Warrick.  This is about Mrs. Warrick and what
 8       conduct of Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds actually
 9       impacted her, actually impacted her.
10            Now, if you answer that question, then your
11       work won't be done.  There'll be another session,
12       there'll be another opening statement, more
13       evidence, closing argument.  So your work won't be
14       over.
15            All right.  I want to con- -- oh, one other
16       thing.  Mr. Shields said that all that evidence we
17       put in about newspaper articles, magazine articles,
18       videos, he said that was only limited until about
19       1970 or '71 and then it all petered out and it was
20       all shown after midnight, and all that kind of
21       stuff.
22            You'll have these back in the back with you,
23       but we selected -- Mr. Bradford, in particular,
24       selected just examples of those Public Service
25       Announcements.  And, of course, you saw the Harry

 1       Reasoner CBS news report.  That, of course, wasn't
 2       at midnight.
 3            The Bill Talman announcements, that's 1967; the
 4       "Killers" ad, that's where the cowboys come in,
 5       that's '68; the snakebite where the snake comes out
 6       and bites you, that's '69; the "Nice and Clear"
 7       where the ashtray empties out, that's '69; the
 8       warnings where they had all of the various warnings,
 9       that's an example.  That was '69.
10            The obituary of Bill Talman, Walter Cronkite. 11       You know Walter Cronkite wasn't on at 2:00 on the
12       morning.  That's '69.
13            The Huff and Puff, that's '70; "Dreams," that's
14       '70; "Great American Smokeout" with Ed Asner, '77;
15       "Great American Smokeout" with Ed Asner, '78, while
16       Larry Hagman's are in the '80s.  It didn't stop.  It
17       didn't stop.
18            All right.  You guys have been very patient and
19       very attentive.  And so I thank you.
20            I'm going to sit down and Mr. Engram is going
21       to get up.  He's going to talk to you about -- I'm
22       sure he'll talk to you a bit about R.J. Reynolds,
23       but he's also going to talk to you about what caused
24       her death.
25            And now after I -- after both of us sit down,

 1       then Mr. Shields gets to get back up and he gets to
 2       address you again, because he has the burden of
 3       proof on everything but the statute of limitations.
 4            He has to show you that they brought a bigger
 5       mountain of evidence in this case about
 6       Mrs. Warrick, connecting to Mrs. Warrick than we
 7       did.
 8            And I won't get to get back up, nor will
 9       Mr. Engram.  And we won't have another opportunity
10       to come back and say, hey, wait a minute.
11       Mr. Shields mischaracterized what I said in my
12       opening statement or he didn't give you all of the
13       causation, legal cause instruction, he didn't give
14       you all of the quotes.  I won't get to do that.
15            So all I would ask is that as he makes -- and
16       he has another hour to talk to you, if he wants to
17       use it.  So all I would ask is that you just think
18       in the back of your mind, what does this have to do
19       with Mrs. Warrick?  Does this really connect to
20       Mrs. Warrick, really, in a direct way resulting in a
21       substantial impact.  Because that's what you're
22       going to get in the instructions.
23            Thank you very much.


12             MR. ENGRAM:  Thank you, Your Honor.
13             Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you, too
14        for the time that you've spent here for the last
15        three weeks.  When Mr. Reilly back during jury 16        selection in the courthouse downtown talked about
17        jury duty, he talked about it being both a privilege
18        and a responsibility.
19             Well, I also think that it's a great sacrifice
20        for you to be away from your families, and your
21        jobs, and spend this time and give this attention to
22        the case and the witnesses and the evidence, and on
23        behalf of Mr. Latham and myself and our client R.J.
24        Reynolds, we really do appreciate that.  Our system
25        wouldn't work without people like you that make this

 1        kind of sacrifice.
 2             What I want to talk about with you about today
 3        is the evidence we presented on a couple of issues
 4        because of Eveline Warrick's death and the work that
 5        the scientists and other employees at R.J. Reynolds
 6        Tobacco Company have been doing over the last 60
 7        years.
 8             But before I talk about that, I want to look
 9        back at these last nine days of testimony and make
10        three observations.  First of all, I like to think
11        of the closing statement as a report card.  You get
12        to check off the things, the promises that we made
13        to you in our opening statement and see if we were
14        held to those promises.
15             The second thing, though, not only is this like
16        a report card, but I wondered -- I wondered during
17        closing, I wondered during the presentation of
18        evidence, during the witnesses who testified, were
19        the plaintiffs and the defendants trying the same
20        case here.
21             We told you when we came -- when we began our
22        opening statement that this case was about, first
23        and foremost, Mrs. Warrick.  It was about what she
24        knew about the risks of smoking; it was about the
25        choices Mrs. Warrick made; it's about what diseases

 1        and conditions that she had; and it's about what
 2        caused her death.  That's what we told you this case
 3        was about.
 4             The plaintiff, though, on the other hand, has
 5        spent very little time talking about Mrs. Warrick.
 6        They've tried to retry that first Engle case.  And
 7        they brought generic experts, general experts,
 8        experts who knew nothing about Eveline Warrick to
 9        prove a case of general company conduct, to prove
10        the case of some unknown plaintiff. And, certainly,
11        they did not prove the case of Mrs. Warrick.
12             We know that Mrs. Warrick knew nothing about
13        the Frank Statement.  We know during their closing
14        they put up seven documents.  And as Mr. Shields put
15        those documents up on the screen and said that they
16        were representative of the millions of pages of
17        documents, that's what Dr. Proctor told you, he put
18        up company documents from 1953, 1961, 1962, 1963,
19        1967, 1969 and 1972.
20             He put up two ads.  He put up two ads.  And do
21        you remember what cigarette brands they were about?
22        The first one was Old Gold and the second one was
23        for Camels.
24             Eveline Warrick didn't smoke Old Gold and she
25        didn't smoke Camels.  Why would he be showing you
4646  1        these ads about somebody else's brands of
 2        cigarettes?  Old Gold isn't even made by Philip
 3        Morris or R.J. Reynolds.
 4             And the last observation I want to make is that
 5        we put in part of our case through our
 6        Cross-Examination of plaintiff's witnesses.  And so
 7        even though the plaintiffs took six days to present
 8        their evidence through their witnesses and the
 9        defendants took only three days, when we are
10        cross-examining their witnesses, we're putting on
11        evidence as well which we believe proves our case.
12             So don't just think about the defendant's case
13        as being the evidence that you heard Tuesday,
14        Wednesday and Thursday of this week.  Think about
15        what other evidence we elicited when we
16        cross-examined the plaintiff's witnesses. And I'm
17        going to try to highlight some of the things those
18        witnesses said.
19             So let's talk about the evidence you heard on
20        the cause of Mrs. Warrick's death.  You heard in
21        plaintiff's opening statement that they told you
22        that Mrs. Warrick's death was caused by her cancer
23        and her treatment for her cancer or from her COPD.
24             Well, which one was it?  Those are three
25        different potential causes.  But more importantly,

 1        they never told you how her COPD or how her lung
 2        cancer or how her treatment for her lung cancer
 3        caused her death.  They never answered the
 4        how-she-died question.
 5             They had Dr. Bagnoli testify that Mrs. Warrick
 6        died from both her COPD and her lung cancer, even
 7        though he couldn't tell you how either of those
 8        diseases caused Mrs. Warrick's death.  And,
 9        remember, Dr. Bagnoli said that the autopsy report
10        that Calvin Warrick requested at the insistence of
11        Norma Warrick didn't say she died from COPD, didn't
12        say she died from her lung cancer.
13             They brought Dr. Nurani, the radiation
14        oncologist, who treated Mrs. Warrick.  He never said
15        that COPD caused Mrs. Warrick's death.  And what did
16        he say about the cause of death?  We had a few
17        questions at the end of his videotaped deposition.
18        But remember, he said that a medical examiner, a
19        forensic pathologist would be a better expert to
20        testify on the cause of death.
21             And that's the kind of expert we brought you in
22        Dr. Mark Shuman, the medical examiner from
23        Miami-Dade County.  And what did he say on COPD?
24        Well, he said that Mrs. Warrick's COPD was stable
25        for many years and that the autopsy, with respect to

 1        her lung cancer, that the autopsy showed that she
 2        had no cancer in her lungs; that the chemotherapy
 3        treatment had worked and the autopsy doctors could
 4        not find any evidence of cancer in her lungs at the
 5        time she died.  Nor did the autopsy doctor find any
 6        evidence of pneumonia when Mrs. Warrick died.
 7             And it's almost as if they're telling you, we
 8        don't know how Mrs. Warrick died.  We know she had
 9        COPD; we know she had lung cancer.  It must have
10        been one of those; we're going to leave it up to you
11        to decide.  But that's not the way it works, ladies 12        and gentlemen.  You have to base your decision on
13        the evidence in this case.
14             Mr. Shields, in his closing, wasn't talking
15        about cause of death but he -- I wrote this down --
16        he said, data or not, use your common sense.  Well,
17        data is a type of evidence.  You're not going to be
18        instructed by Judge Boyer, evidence or no evidence,
19        use your common sense.
20             We want you to use your common sense, but you
21        have to rely on evidence in making your decision.
22        And the plaintiff's witnesses don't provide you with
23        any evidence as to how Mrs. Warrick died.  And
24        because they don't, they can't meet their burden of
25        proof on the cause of death.

 1             Let's look at how Mr. Reilly and I, though,
 2        proved to you that Mrs. Warrick's sudden cardiac
 3        death was caused by a grossly enlarged heart that
 4        was electrically unstable and that resulted in her
 5        heart going into V. Fib, ventricular fibrillation.
 6        There were only two witnesses who talked about how
 7        Mrs. Warrick died when her heart stopped beating,
 8        when it went into sudden cardiac arrest.
 9             Dr. Bishopric, the cardiologist from the
10        University of Miami School of Medicine and
11        Dr. Shuman, the medical examiner and forensic
12        pathologist from Miami-Dade County.  And what did
13        they say specifically about Mrs. Warrick's heart
14        that we can agree on?  Well, let's get out the
15        report card.
16             In my opening I said we would prove
17        Mrs. Warrick had an enlarged heart, and we did that.
18        You'll have the autopsy report.  You'll have the
19        medical records, and there are numerous references
20        to the enlarged heart.
21             We told you in opening Mrs. Warrick's heart
22        weighed 650 grams at autopsy.  And we proved that.
23        You have it in the autopsy report.
24             We also proved that the normal weight for a
25        woman's heart is 300 grams.  Both Dr. Shuman and

 1        Dr. Bishopric testified to that.  Both of them
 2        testified that high blood pressure causes
 3        hypertrophic heart disease.  Hypertrophic was one of
 4        those medical terms for an enlarged heart.
 5             Both of them testified that Mrs. Warrick's
 6        weight contributed to her enlarged heart.
 7             The evidence is in the medical records
 8        Mrs. Warrick weighed over 200 pounds until April of
 9        2009.
10             You'll see the photomicrographs, the actual
11        slides of the tissue from Mrs. Warrick's heart and
12        her heart was filled with scar tissue and fat at
13        autopsy.
14             Dr. Bishopric talked about how genetics play a
15        role in an enlarged heart.  Enlarged hearts are more
16        vulnerable to arrhythmias.  Both Dr. Shuman and
17        Bishopric testified to that and they both said that
18        smoking does not cause an enlarged heart or
19        hypertrophic heart disease.
20             And that's what our report card shows.
21             You know, the plaintiff didn't call
22        Mrs. Warrick's treating cardiologist or medical 23        examiner.  And the plaintiff has the burden of
24        proving the cause of Mrs. Warrick's death in this
25        case.  They have filed the wrongful death claim and

 1        it's their burden to prove that she died a death due
 2        to something our clients did or failed to do.
 3             In fact, not only did Mrs. Warrick have one
 4        cardiologist, she had at least two cardiologists.
 5        Do you remember when Dr. Bagnoli came here,
 6        Mrs. Warrick's lung doctor, and said Mrs. Warrick
 7        was seeing Dr. Ramezani, a cardiologist before she
 8        ever started to be treated with me?
 9             Well, doctor -- and the other cardiologist that
10        we know Mrs. Warrick saw was a Dr. Baker and you'll
11        see those medical records from the Baker Gilmour
12        Cardiovascular Institute.  But why didn't they bring
13        Mrs. Warrick's own heart doctors to court?  Well, I
14        think you'll find the answer in the medical records
15        that we showed you with Dr. Shuman and Dr.
16        Bishopric.
17             In 2002, Dr. Ramezani is one of the heart
18        doctors who found that Mrs. Warrick had electrical
19        problems with her heart.  This is an EKG and at the
20        top you have Mrs. Warrick's name, the date, December
21        12, 2002, sinus tachycardia with occasional
22        premature supraventricular complexes.
23             And Dr. Shuman testified, as did Dr. Bishopric,
24        that premature ventricular complexes are these
25        electrical problems, arrhythmias, irregular rhythms

 1        in the heart.
 2             Tachycardia was one of those types of
 3        arrhythmias where the heart beats too fast.  And so
 4        in December of 2002 we have evidence from
 5        Dr. Ramezani that Mrs. Warrick had electrical
 6        problems with her heart.
 7             Remember, too, the other piece of evidence that
 8        we put up from Dr. Ramezani; the cardiac
 9        catheterization that he did in 2001.  Dr. Ramezani
10        did this catheterization six months after
11        Mrs. Warrick had quit smoking in Thanksgiving of
12        2000, finding that the left main coronary artery is
13        normal in size and free of any significant disease.
14             The left anterior descending coronary artery is
15        also free of any significant disease.
16             The circumflex coronary artery is normal in
17        size and appears to be free of any significant
18        stenosis.
19             So six months after Mrs. Warrick quit smoking,
20        her coronary cardiac catheterization is normal.
21             And what about Dr. Baker, of the Baker Gilmour
22        Cardiovascular Institute?  In April of 2008
23        Dr. Gilmour interpreted Mrs. Warrick's
24        echocardiogram and he said it showed good EF.
25        Dr. Shuman said EF stood for ejection fraction, but

 1        significant cardiomegaly.  And y'all remember what
 2        cardiomegaly was?  It's just another word for --
 3        medical term for enlarged heart.
 4             So is it any wonder why the plaintiffs didn't
 5        call Dr. Ramezani or Dr. Baker when they knew that
 6        both of her cardiologists had records that were
 7        damaging to their theory about the cause of  8        Mrs. Warrick's death?
 9             Let's talk about what Dr. Shuman, the medical
10        examiner, did to determine the cause and manner of
11        death.  Remember, that's what he said that forensic
12        or autopsy pathologists do, and he's somebody that
13        does 200 a year.  He does -- he's done 2500
14        autopsies during the course of his practice as a
15        forensic pathologist.
16             And Dr. Shuman said that a medical examiner
17        determines the chain of events that lead to death.
18        And that chain of events actually comes right off
19        the death certificate, what they're required to find
20        in the death certificate.
21             And in Mrs. Warrick's case, there are basically
22        what I'll call three links in the chain of events.
23        The first link is her longstanding high blood
24        pressure.  Well, we showed you and we'll just run
25        through these quickly.  Every year of her life that

 1        we have medical records for, from 1982 and then
 2        beginning again in 1998 through April of 2009,
 3        Mrs. Warrick had high blood pressure readings
 4        recorded in her medical records.
 5             Did they get better?  Sure they did.  But she
 6        had 12 years of high blood pressure and the toll
 7        that that took on her heart is the second link in
 8        this chain of events.
 9             She had an enlarged diseased electrically
10        unstable heart; a heart that weighed 650 grams at
11        the time she died, more than twice the size of a
12        normal person's heart; so much fat that not only did
13        it surround the heart, but it infiltrated both the
14        left and right ventricles and scarring.  Remember,
15        interstitial fibrosis was just another medical term
16        for scarring in the heart muscle itself.
17             That's the second link.  The enlarged heart is
18        the second link in the change of events that led to
19        Mrs. Warrick's death.
20             You know, Dr. Shuman talked about the enlarged
21        heart.  He's the one that put up Dr. Baker's 2008
22        report that I showed you a moment ago.  And
23        Dr. Shuman, in discussing enlarged heart, said that
24        they're electrically unstable, that they're more
25        vulnerable to these electrical problems, they're

 1        more vulnerable to arrhythmias and irregular
 2        heartbeats.
 3             And he also testified that Mrs. Warrick had
 4        progressively worsening irregular heartbeats, so
 5        much so that by October of 2007 she had a 24-hour
 6        Holter monitor, and this showed two things.  Didn't
 7        blow up the first thing, but it showed sinus
 8        bradycardia.  Well, that's the opposite of what she
 9        had in that earlier record with Dr. Ramezani when
10        she had tachycardia.  That's the fast irregular
11        heart rhythm.  Bradycardia is a slow irregular heart
12        rhythm.
13             And then -- but Dr. Shuman wanted to point out
14        that the computer recorded 1,310 isolated premature
15        ventricular contractions -- premature is early --
16        ventricular contractions.
17             What did they say about how many premature
18        ventricular contractions a normal person has?  They 19        said you shouldn't have any; zero.
20             This wasn't the only test that we --
21        Mrs. Warrick had run and that we brought and
22        presented to you.  In July of 2009 we know that
23        Mrs. Warrick underwent placement of a Loop Recorder
24        similar to a Holter monitor, except it actually, as
25        Dr. Bishopric described, gets placed inside just

 1        under the chest skin.
 2             And why had she been having -- why did she have
 3        this Loop Recorder?  Because she fainted at home in
 4        the bathroom, and when she fainted she fell and hit
 5        her head in the bathtub.  Well, the Loop Recorder
 6        showed that she had periods where her heart just
 7        stopped beating for more than three seconds.
 8             And we used this description on the heart
 9        monitor that you see on TV shows, instead of seeing
10        a regular heartbeat, for three seconds it would flat
11        line.  Mrs. Warrick had to have a pacemaker put in
12        July 2nd, 2009 to treat this period -- this period
13        where her heart stopped beating for periods of more
14        than three seconds.
15             Link number three.  What's the final link in
16        the chain of events?  Well, that final link is the
17        V. Fib, the ventricular fibrillation.  On the day
18        that Mrs. Warrick died she was found with no pulse,
19        not breathing for 20 minutes, but with an electrical
20        rhythm; an electrical rhythm that the Jacksonville
21        fire and rescue described as V. Fib or ventricular
22        fibrillation.
23             And remember that Dr. Shuman described V. Fib
24        as the heart muscle just quivering -- not pumping,
25        not beating -- just quivering.

 1             What did the Jacksonville fire and rescue call
 2        it?  The EMS?  They found -- they reported what they
 3        found when they initially arrived.  On initial
 4        contact there were no pulses, no heartbeats, with a
 5        V. Fib rhythm.
 6             Primary impression:  Cardiac arrest.
 7             Secondary impression:  Cardiac rhythm
 8        disturbance.
 9             The evidence is overwhelming that Mrs. Warrick
10        had a severe electrical problem with her heart and
11        the chain of events establishes that this is what
12        caused her death.
13             You know, there was even a time in 2007 with
14        Dr. Zenk, one of Mrs. Warrick's partners, where she
15        was skipping a heartbeat.  Her heart, regularly
16        irregular.  Not isolated.  Regularly irregular with
17        four skipped beats per minute.
18             What's her diagnosis?  Her diagnosis is
19        arrhythmia.  It's a little bit covered up here.  And
20        for the plan for that first diagnosis, for diagnosis
21        number one, patient to see her cardiologist in a few
22        weeks.  What did Dr. Zenk want to do?  She didn't
23        want to wait a few weeks.  She wanted her to have a
24        Holter monitor right then.  And it's the Holter
25        monitor that she has two years later with -- in

 1        fact, the date on that -- I'm sorry, could you go
 2        back?  I just want to correct something there.
 3             The date on this -- do we have the first page?  4        I see it's on the title but I believe the actual
 5        date is July 21, 2007.
 6             That exhibit is Defendant's Exhibit 44.  It's
 7        in the record, and you'll be able to review it, but
 8        that's my recollection, is that the date is July 21,
 9        2007.
10             It's not until 2009 when she's having these
11        fainting episodes that they actually do anything to
12        treat Mrs. Warrick with this heart electrical
13        problem that she has.
14             You know, Dr. Bagnoli knew about this.  He came
15        and testified to you that, you know, in his opinion,
16        it was either COPD or lung cancer.  Didn't tell you
17        how, but he knew that when he saw Mrs. Warrick in
18        July of 2009, he knew enough that when Mrs. Warrick
19        had these fainting -- recurring fainting spells, he
20        knew enough to suggest to her doctors that they
21        needed to consider cardiac arrhythmias.
22             And, finally, Dr. Bishopric explained that the
23        type of pacemaker that Mrs. Warrick had had a dual
24        chamber pacemaker designed to make sure that the
25        heart didn't go below a certain critical level.  But

 1        Mrs. Warrick's heart just was not beating on
 2        schedule.  It was stopping for periods of greater
 3        than three seconds.  It was skipping beats -- four
 4        beats, every minute.  Those are the kinds of issues
 5        that she had when the fire and rescue found her.
 6             Now, let's go back to Dr. Shuman's three links
 7        in the chain of events for a moment.
 8             Longstanding high blood pressure; enlarged,
 9        diseased electrically unstable heart; and
10        ventricular fibrillation.
11             You know, Dr. Shuman was asked a question on
12        Cross-Examination by Mr. Shields, and I just want to
13        go through each of these points with respect to
14        their testimony so there's no confusion.
15             Dr. Shuman and Dr. Bishopric both agree that
16        ventricular fibrillation was the final link in the
17        chain of events leading to Mrs. Warrick's death.
18        There's no dispute about that final link.
19             Dr. Shuman and Dr. Bishopric both agree that
20        Mrs. Warrick had this massive enlarged heart, more
21        than twice the normal size for a woman, and there's
22        no dispute about that.
23             And Dr. Shuman and Dr. Bishopric both said that
24        high blood pressure, longstanding high blood
25        pressure can cause a heart to become enlarged.  You

 1        know, Dr. Shuman explained that the heart is a
 2        muscle and it gets larger when it's put under
 3        stress, just like any other muscle in the body.
 4             And I asked Dr. Shuman if high blood pressure
 5        was the only thing that can cause an enlarged heart
 6        and he said, no, obesity can do it, valvular heart
 7        disease, genetic defects can also cause enlarged
 8        hearts.
 9             Dr. Bishopric was also asked these same
10        questions by Mr. Reilly.  And it's in the
11        transcript, 3713, Why did Mrs. Warrick's heart get
12        so big?
13             And Dr. Bishopric said, She doesn't know why
14        people's hearts get big in every case.  Sometimes 15        the cause is clear, like when they can do a genetic
16        test and determine it, and sometimes it's not.
17             Well, there was no genetic test done at the
18        autopsy.  So we don't know whether genetics
19        contributed to her enlarged heart.
20             But Dr. Bishopric added, That Mrs. Warrick had
21        hypertension, and that certainly didn't help.  She
22        was a very heavy woman and the heavier you are the
23        bigger your heart gets, it's just the way it is.
24             Mr. Reilly then asked Dr. Bishopric, does
25        hypertension, high blood pressure, affect the size

 1        of your heart, and her answer was, yes, it does, it
 2        makes it bigger.
 3             Let's talk about what the -- and remember --
 4        remember what the Jacksonville fire and rescue
 5        records says, cardiac rhythm disturbance.  What did
 6        the examination of the heart tissue itself show?
 7        The doctor who performed the autopsy made slides to
 8        look at Mrs. Warrick's tissue, not just from the
 9        lungs, but all of the tissues from her autopsy to
10        look at under the microscope.  And we had some
11        pictures of the tissues from her heart and these
12        showed that Mrs. Warrick's heart was diseased.
13             Remember, Dr. Shuman came down and pointed out
14        that these were the fat cells, these white clear
15        circles were all the fat cells surrounding
16        Mrs. Warrick's heart.  And that all of this, these
17        black dots, these cells between the long pink or
18        purple fibers, the muscle tissue itself of the
19        heart, that all of that was abnormal.  It shouldn't
20        have been there.  But it was evidence of an
21        inflammation and fibrosis and the significant
22        disease and damage that Mrs. Warrick's heart had.
23             And that's what the autopsy report finding is
24        with respect to the heart.  Hypertrophy of the
25        heart.  650 grams.  Large amounts of fat.  Fat

 1        outside.  Fat inside.  Fat in two ventricles.  And
 2        scarring in the heart muscle itself.  That's all
 3        uncontroverted.
 4             Dr. Bagnoli said, no, they got that wrong.  He
 5        never said anything of the sort.  And you'll have
 6        these medical records and these pictures with you
 7        when you retire to the jury room to begin your
 8        deliberations.  Nothing in that autopsy report will
 9        suggest to you that Mrs. Warrick died from her
10        cancer or died from her COPD.  And we'd ask that you
11        answer those questions on the verdict form,
12        questions 4 and 5 -- and Your Honor, I do think
13        there's a typo in the verdict form that we'll have
14        to correct.  That should be, Please proceed to
15        question 5 -- was Eveline Warrick's lung cancer a
16        legal cause of her death?
17             The overwhelming evidence is, no.
18             Was Eveline Warrick's COPD a legal cause of her
19        death?
20             Mr. Reilly talked to you about legal cause.  I
21        won't repeat that.  The answer is, no, based on the
22        overwhelming evidence.
23             Don't ignore the data.  Don't ignore the
24        evidence.
25             You know, Mr. Shields wants you to believe that 4663
 1        a woman who's 181 pounds or 200 pounds, somewhere in
 2        that neighborhood was cachectic.  Well, that's
 3        another medical word that I had to get my dictionary
 4        out to understand.  But a person who's cachectic is
 5        wasting away.  And you remember he asked Dr. Shuman
 6        about it.  Don't you think she was cachectic?  Don't
 7        you think she was wasting away?
 8             And she said, no, there's no way that a woman
 9        who weighs 200 pounds is cachectic.  It's not just
10        Dr. Bishopric's opinion.  The autopsy report doesn't
11        describe Mrs. Warrick as frail or cachectic.
12             The autopsy report says, in describing her
13        abdomen, her stomach, her belly is what I'd call it,
14        that the abdomen was soft to palpation, without
15        masses, and protuberant, sticking out, secondary to
16        obesity.  And what was the diagnosis in the autopsy
17        report?  Under Accessory Diagnosis, the first
18        accessory diagnosis is moderate obesity.  There's no
19        way Mrs. Warrick was cachectic when she died
20        February 7th, 2010.
21             Why did lung cancer not contribute or cause
22        Mrs. Warrick's death?  Well, let's talk about
23        Dr. Shuman's testimony.  Dr. Shuman told you, based
24        on the autopsy report, there was no cancer found in
25        her lungs.  They had -- she had ten nodules in her

 1        liver that were less than a half an inch in
 2        diameter.  But the tumor and the liver was stable.
 3        They didn't even know that the cancer had spread to
 4        her brain.  They didn't know that when they removed
 5        her brain.  They didn't know that when they looked
 6        at her brain without the benefit -- without the
 7        benefit of microscope.  When they simply looked at
 8        it using the naked eye, they did not identify any
 9        cancer in Mrs. Warrick's brain.  It was only when
10        they made these slides to look under the microscope
11        that they found what Dr. Bishopric called
12        micrometastasis, metastasis that can only be seen
13        under the high power of a microscope.
14             And just as importantly, Mrs. Warrick had no
15        symptoms of liver failure or brain dysfunction when
16        she died.
17             The plaintiffs want you to believe that because
18        Mrs. Warrick had pneumonia some three weeks before
19        she died when she went in to the hospital that
20        somehow she died of lung cancer.  Now, I don't know
21        how you make the leap from pneumonia that is
22        resolved after you're in the hospital to death by
23        lung cancer.  I just don't see how you can do that.
24             Dr. Bagnoli never said how Mrs. Warrick died
25        from her lung cancer.  And Dr. Shuman explained why

 1        the autopsy proves that she didn't die from her lung
 2        cancer.  Remember, Dr. Shuman showed you the
 3        discharge summary from her hospitalization in
 4        January when she was sent home February 3rd, 2010.
 5             And remember, one of her diagnosis, one of the
 6        things that they monitored, that they found while
 7        she was in the hospital in January was atrial
 8        fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
 9        She continued to have electrical problems with her
10        heart while she was in the hospital in January. 11             But this is what the doctor said right before
12        he sent her home:  Given her overall condition, she
13        did quite well.  She was somewhat slow to improve,
14        but did gradually improve.  She is doing much better
15        at the time of discharge.  Her shortness of breath
16        is significantly improved.  Her pancytopenia has
17        resolved.
18             Do you remember when Mr. Shields was arguing
19        that she was immunosuppressed?  There's no question
20        that when she went in on January 18th she was
21        immunosuppressed.  When she went home, her
22        pancytopenia had resolved.  Her hemoglobin and her
23        hematocrit has been stable, meaning she's not
24        anemic, and she is now cleared for discharge home.
25             They sent her home and told her to follow up

 1        with her doctors in one to two weeks.  The doctors
 2        had sent her home from Memorial Hospital did not
 3        think she was going to die four days later.
 4             And, remember, how Norma Warrick was surprised?
 5        I asked her about the autopsy, why it came about
 6        that an autopsy was asked for in this case.  And she
 7        was surprised at her mother's death.  She was
 8        surprised because her mother had been getting
 9        better.  She had this piece of paper, the PET scan
10        that said that the cancer was gone from the lungs.
11        She was getting better, not worse.  And she said to
12        her father, daddy, don't you want to know why Momma
13        died?  That's the reason she convinced her father to
14        ask for an autopsy.  She wasn't frail.  She wasn't
15        cachectic.  She didn't die from her lung cancer or
16        her COPD.
17             Remember, we told you in the beginning that
18        this case is all about Eveline Warrick.  It's about
19        the choices that Mrs. Warrick made, it's about the
20        fact that she was morbidly obese, as her doctors
21        called it, and that the obesity contributed to her
22        high blood pressure.  Her high blood pressure
23        contributed to her enlarged heart, her massive
24        enlarged heart, as Dr. Shuman described it.  And it
25        was because of this enlarged heart that she had and

 1        was susceptible to and prone to these heart rhythm
 2        irregularities.
 3             And that's what caused her heart to stop
 4        suddenly in February of this year when she was found
 5        by the fire and rescue in V. Fib, no pulse, not
 6        breathing, and she had been down for 20 minutes when
 7        they arrived.
 8             That's the chain of events that caused her
 9        death in February of this year.  Not any cigarettes
10        that she smoked, remembering that she had quit
11        nearly ten years prior to her death on Thanksgiving
12        Day in 2000.
13             Now, when I started my closing, I told you I
14        also wanted to highlight some testimony that we
15        elicited on Cross-Examination from plaintiff's
16        experts, Dr. Burns, Dr. Proctor, and Dr. Farone
17        regarding the research that had been conducted at
18        R.J. Reynolds over the last 60 years.
19             And you'll remember that the plaintiffs
20        introduced a number of documents, not just medical
21        records, but company documents from what Dr. Proctor 22        described as tens of millions of pages, millions of
23        documents.  And we've already highlighted the
24        documents that the plaintiffs listed in their
25        closing, which you would think would be the most

 1        important documents that they would want to present
 2        to you to prove their case.
 3             The newest document from that list in
 4        plaintiff's closing was from 1972.  Well, here's all
 5        of the documents out of the tens of millions of
 6        pages that R.J. Reynolds, that American Tobacco
 7        Company, and that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company
 8        generated, that they brought to you, they brought
 9        you one from the 1920s.  Nothing from the '30s and
10        '40s.  Nine documents from the '50s.  Three
11        documents from the '60s.  Nine documents from the
12        '70s.  And three documents from the '80s.
13             25 documents out of tens of millions of pages.
14        And the most recent one out of all of those that
15        were just even commenced during the plaintiff's case
16        was 1984, 26 years ago.  And I think some of you
17        weren't even born 26 years ago.
18             What about some of the Reynolds employees who
19        wrote these documents?  You've heard Dr. Claude
20        Teague, Dr. Alan Rodgman, Dr. Frank Colby.  Did
21        Dr. Proctor tell you that Dr. Colby's dead?  Did he
22        tell you when Dr. Teague or Dr. Rodgman retired from
23        Reynolds, how many years ago, how many decades ago
24        they retired?  These were documents written in the
25        '50s and '60s and '70s and these are people who are

 1        no longer working at R.J. Reynolds.  Brown and
 2        Williamson no longer exists.  American Tobacco
 3        Company no longer exists.
 4             These documents were written at a different
 5        time.  They were written long ago, and some of them
 6        were written as much as 50 to 70 years ago.  But
 7        this is a case that's taking place in 2010.
 8             Let me talk briefly about some of the things
 9        that Dr. Burns testified to on Cross-Examination.
10        Dr. Burns told you that The Council For Tobacco
11        Research or CTR funded grants for outside
12        researchers.  He said that they funded many
13        distinguished scientists from the top universities.
14        Remember, universities even here in the State of
15        Florida.
16             That some of CTR's research was cofounded by
17        public health groups like the American Cancer
18        Society and the National Cancer Institute.
19             That hundreds, hundreds of CTR articles were
20        published in the peer-reviewed literature.
21             That hundreds of CTR articles were published in
22        the Surgeon General's Report.
23             And more than 50 million Americans have quit
24        smoking.
25             And Dr. Burns finally told you that 80 to 90

 1        percent of the 50 million Americans who quit did so
 2        cold turkey, without any aid or assistance.
 3             You know, we asked Dr. Burns about smokers, and
 4        whether -- he said many times that smokers are
 5        responsible for their own smoking behavior.  That's
 6        Dr. Burns' belief.  That's correct.  7             Even if they are addicted, that smokers are
 8        still responsible for their own smoking behavior,
 9        correct?
10             Yes, that's correct.  The fact that someone is
11        addicted is a barrier for behavioral change, but it
12        doesn't free them from the responsibility for their
13        own behavior.
14             And Dr. Burns talked about the 1988 Surgeon
15        General's Report.  You saw Dr. Koop on video clip.
16        This is what Dr. Koop wrote:  Cigarette smoking is
17        an addictive behavior and the individual smoker must
18        decide whether or not to continue that behavior.
19             Who's decision is it?  Who's choice is it?
20        Even Dr. Koop tells you it's the individual smoker's
21        choice and decision.
22             Let's talk about a couple of other things that
23        Dr. Proctor admitted on Cross-Examination.  He said
24        if either you or a family member were diagnosed with
25        COPD or lung cancer and a doctor told you it was

 1        caused by smoking, that would be a powerful source
 2        of information on the risks of smoking?
 3             And he said, Yes.
 4             He said yes, not knowing anything about Eveline
 5        Warrick or her history about her sister Annie Marie
 6        Griffiths being diagnosed with COPD and lung cancer.
 7        But he agreed that that should be a powerful source
 8        of information on the risks of smoking.
 9             He also said that some people treated cigarette
10        warnings like they treated ads; they didn't pay any
11        attention to them.
12             And Mr. Reilly has talked about the fact that
13        the warning labels aren't the only way that smokers
14        learn about the dangers of smoking.
15             Remember last Monday after Dr. Goldberg
16        testified?  I know Dr. Goldberg went home on Friday,
17        but you came in on Monday morning, Mr. Spruance was
18        here live, and so he testified, and then when
19        Mr. Spruance finished testifying, Judge Boyer read
20        to you and, remember, he's told you, when I read to
21        you, this is the law that I'm giving you.  When I
22        talk to you, extemporaneously, I'm trying to explain
23        it.  But he read to you the law after Dr. Goldberg
24        testified.
25             And what he said was, Congress has determined

 1        as of July 1, 1969 that cigarette warning labels
 2        were effective as a matter of law.  The adequacy or
 3        the sufficiency of the warnings cannot be a basis
 4        for a liability in this case after July 1, 1969.
 5             And here are the warnings that Eveline Warrick
 6        saw.  1966, 1970, and the four rotating warnings
 7        beginning in 1985.  These are the same warnings that
 8        exist on every pack of cigarettes today.
 9             These are the same warnings that Eveline
10        Warrick saw every time she took a cigarette out of
11        the pack.  And you remember from my opening, we
12        calculated based on a pack-and-a-half a day, 365
13        days a year, 30 cigarettes in a pack-and-a-half
14        times 34 years with the number of warnings,
15        Mrs. Warrick was warned 372,300 times.  And she was
16        more powerfully warned with her own personal family
17        experiences, families and friends. 18             Back to Dr. Proctor's testimony.  He
19        acknowledged that the Surgeon General thanked Philip
20        Morris and R.J. Reynolds and others for the
21        information they provided in that big Green book,
22        the Larson, Haag and Silvette collections.  And he
23        also acknowledged, like Dr. Burns did, that RJR
24        scientists research was cited in the 1964, 1979,
25        1981, 1989, and 2000 Surgeon General's Report.

 1             Finally, with respect to Dr. Farone.  You
 2        remember Dr. Farone.  He's the former Philip Morris
 3        scientists who was fired.  What did Dr. Farone admit
 4        on Cross-Examination?  Well, Dr. Farone had the most
 5        to say about R.J. Reynolds research efforts.  He
 6        talked about tar reduction.  He talked about R.J.
 7        Reynolds' conduct.
 8             Let's look at some of the things that
 9        Dr. Farone admitted on videotape on
10        Cross-Examination by Mr. Latham.  First of all,
11        Dr. Farone told you there is no current government
12        standard for what constitutes a safer cigarette, nor
13        has there ever been one.
14             He also told you that Reynolds has devoted
15        historically a tremendous amount of financial
16        resources and scientific talent to try to develop a
17        safer cigarette.
18             That they worked beginning in the 1950s to try
19        to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking; and that
20        they acted as reasonable, prudent cigarette
21        manufacturer identifying and quantifying PAH's and
22        other carcinogens in smoke.
23             Reynolds also engaged in efforts to reduce the
24        constituents in smoke and he described that as a
25        reasonable approach to try to reduce the risks of

 1        smoking.
 2             He told you they used filtration, reconstituted
 3        tobacco, porous paper, filter ventilation, an
 4        expanded tobacco.  And you saw all of those things
 5        when Mr. Jupe testified, the expanded tobacco in the
 6        glass jars, and the diagram of the cigarette -- the
 7        cigarette cone.
 8             Reynolds was the first company to use
 9        reconstituted tobacco.  And when you compare the
10        cigarettes from the 1950s to the cigarettes of
11        today, tar and nicotine yields dropped more than 70
12        percent.
13             Scientist at Reynolds have published a lot of
14        information about cigarette smoke chemistry over the
15        years and they've been repeatedly recognized by the
16        Surgeon General's Report dating back to 1964.
17             Dr. Farone also said that in 1986 the cigarette
18        companies disclosed all the ingredients used in
19        their cigarettes to Congress.
20             And, importantly, the U.S. Government has never
21        told the cigarette companies to remove any
22        ingredient from their products.
23             And, finally, Dr. Farone talked about Reynolds'
24        product stewardship program that works to make sure
25        that any product changes, including addition of new

 1        ingredients, doesn't increase the inherent risks of
 2        smoking.  3             You know, ladies and gentlemen, today is
 4        October 1, 2010.  It's not 1953.  It's not 1964.
 5        It's not 1966.  It's not the 1970s.  It's not 1984.
 6        That's the case that you heard the plaintiffs put
 7        on.  The case you heard them put on was the Engle
 8        findings case.  Remember, the Engle findings don't
 9        answer the issues that you're here to decide.
10             Before you can apply the Engle findings,
11        remember -- and, you know, this sounds almost like
12        the craziest thing you have to do.  But you have to
13        go back into that jury room and completely put the
14        Engle findings that they've hammered to you out of
15        your minds.  You have to decide the question of
16        whether or not Eveline Warrick was an Engle class
17        member without consideration of a single Engle
18        finding.
19             Understanding that, remember, the Engle jury
20        heard no evidence about Eveline Warrick, and the
21        findings that you'll read and hear about don't even
22        mention Eveline Warrick.  The Engle jury didn't
23        decide any issues specific to Eveline Warrick.  It
24        didn't decide on whether she relied on anything that
25        Reynolds said or PM said -- Philip Morris said or

 1        failed to say.
 2             The Engle jury didn't decide that Eveline
 3        Warrick was injured by any conduct of R.J. Reynolds
 4        or its predecessor companies or Philip Morris.
 5             And the Engle findings do not establish that
 6        these defendants are liable to the Estate of Eveline
 7        Warrick.
 8             Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds tried Eveline
 9        Warrick's case.  We put on evidence about her cause
10        of death.  We put on evidence about Mrs. Warrick's
11        awareness.  We put on evidence so that you could
12        decide the issues that the Engle jury didn't decide,
13        issues that they never considered.
14             And on behalf of R.J. Reynolds and Mr. Latham,
15        I want to thank you for your time and for all of
16        your attention.
17             Thank you very much.
